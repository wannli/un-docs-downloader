\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Bel\u00e9m,  \n \nStressing that low greenhouse gas emission development can create employment \nopportunities and quality jobs, in accordance with nationally defined development \npriorities,  \n \nNoting that just transition of the workforce, the creation of decent work and \nquality jobs, and economic diversification are key to maximizing the positive and \nminimizing the negative impacts of response measures and that strategies related to \njust transition and economic diversification should be implemented taking into \naccount different national circumstances and contexts,  \n \nNoting also the contributions of the International Civil Aviation Organization to \nglobal efforts to combat climate change, and noting further the contributions of the \nInternational Maritime Organization in this regard,  \n \nRecognizing that, in undertaking its work, the United Nations should promote \nthe protection of the global climate for the well-being of present and future \ngenerations of humankind,  \n \n1. \nReaffirms that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, \nexpresses profound alarm that the emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise \nglobally, remains deeply concerned that all countries, particularly developing \ncountries, are vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and are already \nexperiencing an increase in such impacts, including persistent drought and extreme \nweather events, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion, ocean acidification \nand changes to the cryosphere, including the melting and retreat of glaciers, such as \nmountain glaciers, leading to glacial lake outburst floods, further threatening food \nsecurity, water availability and livelihoods, and efforts to eradicate poverty in all its \nforms and dimensions and achieve sustainable development, recognizes the \nsubstantial risks posed by climate change to health, and emphasizes in this regard that \nmitigation of and adaptation to climate change represent an immediate and urgent \nglobal priority;  \n \n2. \nEncourages all the Parties to the Paris Agreement to fully implement the \nAgreement, and highlights the synergies between the implementation of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development25 and the Agreement;  \n \n3. \nRecalls that the Paris Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including its objective, \naims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context \n_______________ \n \n25 Resolution 70/1. \n\nProtection of global climate for present and \nfuture generations of humankind \nA/RES/80/138\n \n7/13\n25-20761 \n \nof sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by holding the \nincrease in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above \npre\u2011industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to \n1.5 degrees Celsius above pre\u2011industrial levels, recognizing that this would \nsignificantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change, increasing the ability to \nadapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low \ngreenhouse gas emissions development in a manner that does not threaten food \nproduction, and making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low \ngreenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development;  \n \n4. \nReaffirms the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in \nthe global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre\u2011industrial \nlevels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius \nabove pre\u2011industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks \nand impacts of climate change, underscores that the impacts of climate change will \nbe much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared with \n2 degrees Celsius, and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to \n1.5 degrees Celsius, recognizes that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius \nwith no or limited overshoot requires deep, rapid and sustained reductions in global \ngreenhouse gas emissions of 43 per cent by 2030 and 60 per cent by 2035 relative to \nthe 2019 level and reaching net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, commits to \naccelerate action in this critical decade on the basis of the best available science, \nreflecting equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and \nrespective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances and in the \ncontext of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, and, in \naccordance with article 4 of the Paris Agreement, reiterates the aim to reach global \npeaking of greenhouse gas emissions, as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking \nwill take longer for developing countries, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter \nin accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between \nanthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the \nsecond half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable \ndevelopment and efforts to eradicate poverty;  \n \n5. \nRecalls, in line with decisions 1/CMA.3 and 1/CMA.4, 26  the call to \naccelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies and the \nadoption of policies to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by \nrapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency \nmeasures, including accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal \npower and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, while providing targeted \nsupport to the poorest and most vulnerable, in line with national circumstances, and \nrecognizing the need for support towards a just transition;  \n \n6. \nWelcomes the nationally determined contributions submitted to date, \nrecalls article 3 and article 4, paragraph 3, of the Paris Agreement, and reaffirms that \neach Party\u2019s successive nationally determined contribution will represent a \nprogression beyond the Party\u2019s current nationally determined contribution and reflect \nits highest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities \nand respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, and \nprovide the information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding, in \naccordance with the relevant decision; \n \n7. \nNotes with concern that, according to the synthesis report on nationally \ndetermined contributions 27  published by the secretariat of the United Nations \n_______________ \n \n26 See FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 and FCCC/PA/CMA/2022/10/Add.1.

nationally determined contributions \npresented thus far by the Parties to the Paris Agreement are not sufficient and that \naction is needed to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below \n2 degrees Celsius above pre\u2011industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the \ntemperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre\u2011industrial levels, urges Parties \nthat have not yet communicated new or updated nationally determined contributions \nto do so as soon as possible, and encourages Parties to communicate in 2025 \nnationally determined contributions with an end date of 2035, in 2030 a nationally \ndetermined contribution with an end date of 2040 and so forth every five years \nthereafter;  \n \n8. \nRecalls article 3 and article 4, paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 11, of the Paris \nAgreement and requests Parties that have not yet done so to revisit and strengthen the \n2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions, as necessary, to align with \nthe Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2025, taking into account different \nnational circumstances, reaffirms the nationally determined nature of nationally \ndetermined contributions and article 4, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement, and \nencourages Parties to come forward in their next nationally determined contributions \nwith ambitious, economy-wide emission reduction targets, covering all greenhouse \ngases, sectors and categories and aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees \nCelsius, as informed by the latest science, in the light of different national \ncircumstances, also encourages Parties to align their next nationally determined \ncontributions with long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, \nand urges Parties that have not yet done so to communicate, as soon as possible, their \nlong-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies referred to in article \n4, paragraph 19, of the Paris Agreement towards just transitions to net-zero emissions \nby or around mid-century, taking into account different national circumstances;  \n \n9. \nAlso recalls article 4 of the Paris Agreement, in particular paragraph 15, \nwhich states that Parties shall take into consideration in the implementation of the \nParis Agreement the concerns of Parties with economies most affected by the impacts \nof response measures, particularly developing country Parties, recognizing the social \nand economic opportunities and challenges that arise from the efforts to achieve the \nParis Agreement temperature goal;  \n \n10. Notes with serious concern the findings from the synthesis report of the \nsixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the \ncontribution of Working Group I, in which the Intergovernmental Panel indicates that \nglobal warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius and 2 degrees Celsius above pre\u2011industrial \nlevels will be exceeded during the twenty-first century, unless deep, rapid and \nsustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions occur in this decade, from the \ncontribution of Working Group II, in which the Intergovernmental Panel indicates that \nhuman-induced climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts in every \nregion across the world and related losses and damages to nature and people reaching \nsome adaptation limits and that adaptation plays a key role in reducing exposure and \nvulnerability to climate change, and the contribution of Working Group III, in which \nthe Intergovernmental Panel stressed that accelerated and equitable climate action in \nmitigating and adapting to climate change impacts is critical to sustainable \ndevelopment;  \n \n11. \nEmphasizes the importance of just transition pathways as a means to enhance \nambition and implementation and ensure the social and economic benefits of transitions, \nin order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and the United Arab Emirates \n\nProtection of global climate for present and \nfuture generations of humankind \nA/RES/80/138\n \n9/13\n25-20761 \n \njust transition work programme on just transition pathways, in accordance with \ndecisions 1/CP.27, 1/CMA.4 and 3/CMA.5;28 \n \n12.
