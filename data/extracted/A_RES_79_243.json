When the extradition is sought \nfor the purpose of serving a final sentence of imprisonment or another form of \ndetention imposed in respect of an extraditable offence, the requested State Party may \ngrant the extradition in accordance with domestic law. \n2. \nNotwithstanding paragraph 1 of this article, a State Party whose law so permits \nmay grant the extradition of a person for any of the criminal offences established in \naccordance with this Convention that are not punishable under its own domestic law. \n3. \nIf the request for extradition includes several separate criminal offences, at least \none of which is extraditable under this article and some of which are not extraditable \nby reason of their period of imprisonment but are related to offences established in \naccordance with this Convention, the requested State Party may apply this article also \nin respect of those offences. \n4. \nEach of the offences to which this article applies shall be deemed to be included \nas an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty existing between States Parties. \nStates Parties undertake to include such offences as extraditable offences in every \nextradition treaty to be concluded between them. \n5. \nIf a State Party that makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty \nreceives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no \nextradition treaty, it may consider this Convention the legal basis for extradition in \nrespect of any offence to which this article applies. \n6. \nStates Parties that make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall: \n \n(a) \nAt the time of deposit of their instruments of ratification, acceptance or \napproval of or accession to this Convention, inform the Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations whether they will take this Convention as the legal basis for \ncooperation in extradition with other States Parties to this Convention; and \n\nA/RES/79/243 \nUnited Nations Convention against Cybercrime; Strengthening International \nCooperation for Combating Certain Crimes Committed by Means of Information \nand Communications Technology Systems and for the Sharing of Evidence in\nElectronic Form of Serious Crimes\n \n24-24621\n22/46 \n \n \n(b) \nIf they do not take this Convention as the legal basis for cooperation in \nextradition, seek, where appropriate, to conclude treaties on extradition with other \nStates Parties to this Convention in order to implement this article. \n7. \nStates Parties that do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a \ntreaty shall recognize offences to which this article applies as extraditable offences \nbetween themselves. \n8. \nExtradition shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the domestic law \nof the requested State Party or by applicable extradition treaties, including, inter alia, \nconditions in relation to the minimum penalty requirement for extradition and the \ngrounds upon which the requested State Party may refuse extradition. \n9. \nStates Parties shall, subject to their domestic law, endeavour to expedite \nextradition procedures and to simplify evidentiary requirements relating thereto in \nrespect of any offence to which this article applies. \n10. Subject to the provisions of its domestic law and its extradition treaties, the \nrequested State Party may, upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant and \nare urgent, and at the request of the requesting State Party, including when the request \nis transmitted through existing channels of the International Criminal Police \nOrganization, take a person whose extradition is sought and who is present in its \nterritory into custody or take other appropriate measures to ensure the person\u2019s \npresence at extradition proceedings. \n11. \nA State Party in whose territory an alleged offender is found, if it does not \nextradite such person in respect of an offence to which this article applies solely on \nthe ground that the person is one of its nationals, shall, at the request of the State \nParty seeking extradition, be obliged to submit the case without undue delay to its \ncompetent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. Those authorities shall take their \ndecisions and conduct their proceedings in the same manner as in the case of any \nother offence of a comparable nature under the domestic law of that State Party. The \nStates Parties concerned shall cooperate with each other, in particular on procedural \nand evidentiary aspects, to ensure the efficiency of such prosecution. \n12. Whenever a State Party is permitted under its domestic law to extradite or \notherwise surrender one of its nationals only upon the condition that the person will \nbe returned to that State Party to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or \nproceedings for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought and that \nState Party and the State Party seeking the extradition of the person agree with this \noption and other terms that they may deem appropriate, such conditional extradition \nor surrender shall be sufficient to discharge the obligation set forth in paragraph 11 \nof this article. \n13. If extradition, sought for purposes of enforcing a sentence, is refused because \nthe person sought is a national of the requested State Party, the requested State Party \nshall, if its domestic law so permits and in conformity with the requirements of such \nlaw, upon application of the requesting State Party, consider the enforcement of the \nsentence imposed under the domestic law of the requesting State Party or the \nremainder thereof. \n14. Any person regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in connection \nwith any of the offences to which this article applies shall be guaranteed fair treatment \nat all stages of the proceedings, including enjoyment of all the rights and guarantees \nprovided by the domestic law of the State Party in the territory of which that person \nis present. \n15. Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to \nextradite if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the \n\nUnited Nations Convention against Cybercrime; Strengthening International \nCooperation for Combating Certain Crimes Committed by Means of Information \nand Communications Technology Systems and for the Sharing of Evidence in \nElectronic Form of Serious Crimes \nA/RES/79/243\n \n23/46\n24-24621 \n \nrequest has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on \naccount of that person\u2019s sex, race, language, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or \npolitical opinions, or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that \nperson\u2019s position for any one of these reasons. \n16. States Parties may not refuse a request for extradition on the sole ground that \nthe offence is also considered to involve fiscal matters. \n17. Before refusing extradition, the requested State Party shall, where appropriate, \nconsult with the requesting State Party to provide it with ample opportunity to present \nits opinions and to provide information relevant to its allegation. \n18. The requested State Party shall inform the requesting State Party of its decision \nwith regard to the extradition. The requested State Party shall inform the requesting \nState Party of any reason for refusal of extradition unless the requested State Party is \nprevented from doing so by its domestic law or its international legal obligations. \n19. Each State Party shall, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument \nof ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, communicate to the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations the name and address of an authority responsible for \nmaking or receiving requests for extradition or provisional arrest. The Secretary-\nGeneral shall set up and keep updated a register of authorities so designated by the \nStates Parties. Each State Party shall ensure that the details held in the register are \ncorrect at all times. \n20. States Parties shall seek to conclude bilateral and multilateral agreements or \narrangements to carry out or to enhance the effectiveness of extradition. \n \n \n \nArticle 38 \n \n \nTransfer of sentenced persons \n \n \nStates Parties may, taking into consideration the rights of sentenced persons, \nconsider entering into bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements on the \ntransfer to their territory of persons sentenced to imprisonment or other forms of \ndeprivation of liberty for offences established in accordance with this Convention, in \norder that they may complete their sentences there. States Parties may also take into \naccount issues relating to consent, rehabilitation and reintegration.  \n \n \n \nArticle 39 \n \n \nTransfer of criminal proceedings \n \n1. \nStates Parties shall consider the possibility of transferring to one another \nproceedings for the criminal prosecution of an offence established in accordance with \nthis Convention where such a transfer is deemed to be in the interests of the proper \nadministration of justice, particularly in cases where several jurisdictions are \ninvolved, with a view to concentrating the prosecution. \n2. \nIf a State Party that makes the transfer of criminal proceedings conditional on \nthe existence of a treaty receives a request for transfer from another State Party with \nwhich it has no treaty in this matter, it may consider this Convention as the legal basis \nfor the transfer of criminal proceedings in respect of any offence to which this article \napplies. \n \n \n \nArticle 40 \n \n \nGeneral principles and procedures relating to mutual legal assistance \n \n1. \nStates Parties shall afford one another the widest measure of mutual legal \nassistance in investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to the \noffences established in accordance with this Convention, and for the purposes of the \n\nA/RES/79/243 \nUnited Nations Convention against Cybercrime; Strengthening International \nCooperation for Combating Certain Crimes Committed by Means of Information \nand Communications Technology Systems and for the Sharing of Evidence in\nElectronic Form of Serious Crimes\n \n24-24621\n24/46 \n \ncollection of evidence in electronic form of offences established in accordance with \nthis Convention, as well as of serious crimes.  \n2. \nMutual legal assistance shall be afforded to the fullest extent possible under \nrelevant laws, treaties, agreements and arrangements of the requested State Party with \nrespect to investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to the \noffences for which a legal person may be held liable in accordance with article 18 of \nthis Convention in the requesting State Party.  \n3. \nMutual legal assistance to be afforded in accordance with this article may be \nrequested for any of the following purposes: \n \n(a) \nTaking evidence or statements from persons; \n \n(b) \nEffecting service of judicial documents;  \n \n(c) \nExecuting searches and seizures, and freezing;  \n \n(d) \nSearching or similarly accessing, seizing or similarly securing, and \ndisclosing electronic data stored by means of an information and communications \ntechnology system pursuant to article 44 of this Convention; \n \n(e) \nCollecting traffic data in real time pursuant to article 45 of this \nConvention; \n \n(f) \nIntercepting content data pursuant to article 46 of this Convention; \n \n(g) \nExamining objects and sites; \n \n(h) \nProviding information, evidence and expert evaluations;  \n \n(i) \nProviding originals or certified copies of relevant documents and records, \nincluding government, bank, financial, corporate or business records; \n \n(j) \nIdentifying or tracing proceeds of crime, property, instrumentalities or \nother things for evidentiary purposes; \n \n(k) \nFacilitating the voluntary appearance of persons in the requesting State \nParty \n \n(l) \nRecovering proceeds of crime;  \n \n(m) Any other type of assistance that is not contrary to the domestic law of the \nrequested State Party. \n4. \nWithout prejudice to domestic law, the competent authorities of a State Party \nmay, without prior request, transmit information relating to criminal matters to a \ncompetent authority in another State Party where they believe that such information \ncould assist the authority in undertaking or successfully concluding inquiries and \ncriminal proceedings or could result in a request formulated by the latter State Party \npursuant to this Convention.  \n5. \nThe transmission of information pursuant to paragraph 4 of this article shall be \nwithout prejudice to inquiries and criminal proceedings in the State of the competent \nauthorities providing the information. The competent authorities receiving the \ninformation shall comply with a request that said information remain confidential, \neven temporarily, or with restrictions on its use. However, this shall not prevent the \nreceiving State Party from disclosing in its proceedings information that is \nexculpatory to an accused person. In such a case, the receiving State Party shall notify \nthe transmitting State Party prior to the disclosure and, if so requested, consult with \nthe transmitting State Party. If, in an exceptional case, advance notice is not possible, \nthe receiving State Party shall inform the transmitting State Party of the disclosure \nwithout delay.  \n\nUnited Nations Convention against Cybercrime; Strengthening International \nCooperation for Combating Certain Crimes Committed by Means of Information \nand Communications Technology Systems and for the Sharing of Evidence in \nElectronic Form of Serious Crimes \nA/RES/79/243\n \n25/46\n24-24621 \n \n6. \nThe provisions of this article shall not affect obligations under any other treaty, \nbilateral or multilateral, that governs or will govern, in whole or in part, mutual legal \nassistance.  \n7. \nParagraphs 8 to 31 of this article shall apply to requests made pursuant to this \narticle if the States Parties in question are not bound by a treaty on mutual legal \nassistance.
