justice, remedies and \nassistance for survivors of sexual violence \nA/RES/76/304\n \n3/8\n22-21527 \n \n \nNoting that sexual and gender-based violence disproportionately affects women \nand girls, while recognizing that men and boys can also be subjected to such violence, \nand recognizing that, notwithstanding women\u2019s and girls\u2019 vital role as agents of \nchange, their poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their marginalization \nresulting from their exclusion from social, environmental and economic policies and \nfrom the benefits of quality education and sustainable development, can place them \nat increased risk of such violence, and that such violence impedes social and \neconomic progress and therefore the sustainable development of communities and \nStates, as well as the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and other internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals, \n \nRecognizing the particular risk of sexual and gender-based violence faced by all \nthose who suffer multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, \n \nRecalling the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence \nin the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,18 noting in this regard the \nundertakings of its Chief Prosecutor to strengthen efforts to combat impunity for \nsexual and gender-based violence, and recalling the recognition by the ad hoc \ninternational criminal tribunals that rape and other forms of sexual violence can \nconstitute a war crime, a crime against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to \ngenocide or torture, \n \nStressing the contribution of the ad hoc international criminal tribunals and the \nInternational Criminal Court to ending impunity by ensuring accountability, \n \nRecognizing that sexual violence in conflict occurs on a continuum of \ninterrelated and recurring forms of violence against women and girls, and that conflict \nalso exacerbates the frequency and brutality of other forms of gender-based violence, \n \nStressing the necessity for all States and non-State parties to conflicts to comply \nfully with their obligations under applicable international law, including the \nprohibition on all forms of sexual violence, \n \nRecalling the responsibilities of States to end impunity and to prosecute those \nresponsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other egregious \ncrimes perpetrated against civilians, and in this regard noting with concern that only \nlimited numbers of perpetrators of sexual violence have been brought to justice, while \nrecognizing that in conflict and in post-conflict situations national justice systems \nmay be significantly weakened, \n \nCommending the continuing efforts of Member States to end impunity by \nensuring accountability and punishing the perpetrators of sexual and gender-based \ncrimes under national and international law, and stressing the need for the perpetrators \nof those crimes to be held accountable by national justice systems or, where \napplicable, international justice, \n \nDeeply concerned about sexual and gender-based violence in all its different \nforms and manifestations worldwide, which is underrecognized and underreported, \nparticularly at the community level, owing to social stigma and inadequate reporting \nand response services, as well as its pervasiveness, which reflects discriminatory \nnorms that reinforce stereotypes and gender inequality and the corresponding \nimpunity and lack of accountability, reiterating the need to intensify efforts to prevent \nand eliminate all forms of sexual and gender-based violence, in all regions of the \nworld, and emphasizing that such violence violates, and impairs the full enjoyment \nof, all human rights of victims and survivors, \n__________________ \n \n18  United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2187, No. 38544. \n\nA/RES/76/304 \nInternational cooperation for access to justice, remedies and \nassistance for survivors of sexual violence\n \n22-21527\n4/8 \n \n \nGravely concerned that domestic violence, including intimate partner violence, \nremains the most prevalent and least visible form of violence against women of all \nsocial strata across the world, and emphasizing that such violence is a violation, abuse \nor impairment of the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and, \nas such, is unacceptable, \n \nDeeply concerned that, despite repeated condemnation of all forms of sexual \nand gender-based violence in vulnerable situations, such as in conflict and post-\nconflict situations, humanitarian settings, as well as during and in the aftermath of \ndisaster, pandemic and epidemic situations, including the process of recovery from \nthe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, such acts of violence in all its forms, \nwith increased use of technology-facilitated violence and extending to stalking and \nthreats of violence, including verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature, \ncontinue to occur and can even increase, and reiterating the need to ensure full access \nto non-discriminatory, confidential and comprehensive specialized services, \nincluding psychosocial health, including sexual and reproductive health-care \nservices, legal and livelihood support and services to victims and survivors, as well \nas to justice, redress and just and effective remedies and assistance for the victims \nand survivors of all forms of such violence, \n \nStressing that States have the obligation, at all levels, to promote, protect and \nrespect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including all women and \ngirls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and hold to \naccount the perpetrators of all forms of violence, eliminate impunity and provide for \neffective access to appropriate remedies and reparations on a national basis for \nvictims and survivors, and should ensure the protection of victims and survivors, \nincluding adequate enforcement of civil remedies, orders of protection and criminal \nsanctions, and the provision of shelters, psychosocial services, counselling, health \nservices, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and other types of \nsupport services, in order to avoid revictimization, to promote an empowering \nenvironment, and that to do so contributes to the enjoyment of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms by all victims and survivors of such violence, \n \nEmphasizing that advancing gender equality and women\u2019s political, social and \neconomic empowerment is critical to the prevention of and response to sexual and \ngender-based violence in conflict and post-conflict situations, and that the safety and \nempowerment of all women and girls are important for their full, equal and \nmeaningful participation in peace processes, preventing conflicts and rebuilding \nsocieties, and that, therefore, women\u2019s protection and participation are inextricably \nlinked and mutually reinforcing, as reflected in relevant resolutions on women and \npeace and security, \n \nRecognizing that the disproportionate impact of sexual violence in armed \nconflict and post-conflict situations on women and girls is exacerbated by \ndiscrimination against women and girls and by the underrepresentation of women in \ndecision-making and leadership roles, the impact of discriminatory laws, the gender-\nbiased enforcement and application of existing laws, harmful social norms and \npractices, structural inequalities, discriminatory views on women or gender roles in \nsociety, and lack of availability of services for victims and survivors, and affirming \nthe importance of promoting gender equality by addressing these and other root \ncauses of sexual violence against all women and girls as part of conflict prevention, \nconflict resolution and peacebuilding, \n \nDeeply concerned about the cases in which the victims and survivors do not \nhave adequate and consistent access to justice remedies, including relief and \nreparations, and assistance programmes, and recognizing the ongoing need for a \ncomprehensive whole-of-system response, including greater cooperation, coherence, \n\nInternational cooperation for access to justice, remedies and \nassistance for survivors of sexual violence \nA/RES/76/304\n \n5/8\n22-21527 \n \ncoordination and complementarity among sustainable development, disaster risk \nreduction, humanitarian action and sustaining peace, \n \nRecognizing the need to promote the full, equal and meaningful participation of \nvictims and survivors of sexual and gender-based violence in the development and \nevaluation of policies, regulations and legislation designed to provide access to \njustice, remedies and assistance for them, \n \nRecognizing also the major contributions of civil society organizations, \nespecially women\u2019s, young women\u2019s, girls\u2019, youth-led, grass-roots and community-\nbased organizations, rural, indigenous and feminist groups, women human rights \ndefenders, women journalists and media professionals and trade unions, as well as the \nimportance of having an open, inclusive and transparent engagement with civil \nsociety in supporting the implementation of

urges \nMember States to provide victims and survivors of sexual violence with access to the \nmechanisms of justice and, as provided for by national legislation, to just and \neffective remedies,
