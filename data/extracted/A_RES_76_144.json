Also reaffirms that respect by States for their protection responsibilities \ntowards refugees is strengthened by international solidarity involving all members of \nthe international community and that the refugee protection regime is enhanced \nthrough committed international cooperation in a spirit of solidarity and burden- and \nresponsibility-sharing among all States;  \n \n27.
