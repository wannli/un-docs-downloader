\nsolutions and approaches,  \n \nWelcoming the increase in the share of renewable energy as a part of total final \nenergy consumption over the past decade and the significant reductions in the cost of \nrenewable energy, the sector\u2019s net positive job contributions and the rapid expansion \nof renewable energy capacity additions, which are now greater than those of other \nresources in the electricity sector, and noting that the levelized cost of solar, wind and \nhydropower energy in many regions of the world is fully competitive with or \nundercuts traditional energy resources, \n \nUnderlining that, despite a general growth in clean and renewable energy \ninvestments, this growth has been unbalanced, with much of it concentrated in \ndeveloped countries, and recognizing that developing countries require support to \nadvance the necessary investments in infrastructure, including renewables, clean \ntechnologies and other necessary long-term investments under the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, \n \nNoting with appreciation the work of the International Renewable Energy \nAgency, which facilitates the widespread and increased adoption and sustainable use \nof
