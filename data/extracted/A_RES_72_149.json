\ncomplementary and mutually reinforcing, \n \nRecognizing the urgency of combating trafficking in persons in all its forms, \nincluding for the purposes of forced or compulsory labour, particularly of women \nmigrant workers, and in this regard taking note of the adoption by the International \nLabour Conference on 11 June 2014, at its 103rd session, of the Protocol to the Forced \nLabour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), and of Recommendation No. 203 on \nsupplementary measures for the effective suppression of forced labour, of the \nInternational Labour Organization, \n \nRecognizing also the increasing participation of women of all skill levels in \ninternational migration, driven in large part by socioeconomic factors, and that this \nfeminization of migration requires greater gender sensitivity in all policies and efforts \nrelated to the subject of international migration, \n \nRecognizing further that the demand for migrant care work appears to be rising, \nwhere the failure to resolve care deficits and secure public provision of care has \nincreased the demand for care work, particularly in the private sphere, and that some \nmigrant workers engaged in informal care work, particularly women, face serious \nhuman rights abuses owing to the invisible nature of their workplace, while many \nbenefit from the economic opportunities offered by care work, \n \nRecognizing the roles and responsibilities of and need for cooperation among \nall stakeholders, in particular countries of origin, transit and destination, relevant \nregional and international organizations, the private sector and civil society, in \npromoting an environment that prevents and addresses violence against women \nmigrant workers, including in the context of discrimination, through targeted \nmeasures, and in this regard recognizing the importance of joint and collaborative \napproaches and strategies at the national, bilateral, regional and international levels, \n \nRecognizing also that the positive contribution of women migrant workers has \nthe potential to foster inclusive growth and sustainable development in countries of \norigin, transit and destination, underlining the value and dignity of their labour, in all \nsectors, including in care and domestic work, and encouraging efforts to improve \npublic perceptions of migrants and migration, \n \nRecognizing further the contribution of women migrant workers to the \ndevelopment of their families, inter alia, through the delivery of remittances, \n \nRecognizing the particular vulnerability and needs of women and their children \nat all stages of the migration process, extending from the moment of deciding to \nmigrate, and including transit, engagement in formal and informal employment and \nintegration into the host society, as well as during their return to and reintegration in \ntheir countries of origin, \n \nExpressing deep concern at the continuing reports of grave abuses and violence \ncommitted against migrant women and girls, including gender-based violence, sexual \nviolence, domestic violence, gender-related killing of women and girls, including \nfemicide, racist and xenophobic acts, discrimination, abusive labour practices, \nexploitative conditions of work and trafficking in persons, including forced labour or \nservices, slavery or practices similar to slavery, while taking into account the \nparticular difficulties in accessing justice that may be faced by women migrant \nworkers, \n \nRecognizing that one of the key causes of the labour exploitation suffered by \nmigrants, including women migrant workers, is linked to the unscrupulous practices \n__________________ \n \n19  CMW/C/GC/1. \n\nViolence against women migrant workers \nA/RES/72/149\n \n5/12 \n17-22937 \n \nof some recruitment agencies and informal brokers that charge high recruitment fees, \nand noting with concern the reports of abuse committed by some recruitment agencies \nand employers, \n \nRecognizing also that violence against women and girls, in particular migrant \nwomen, is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between \nwomen and men, which further reinforces gender stereotypes and barriers to the full \nenjoyment by women and girls of their human rights, \n \nRecognizing further that the intersection of, inter alia, age, class, race and \ngender-based and ethnic discrimination and stereotypes can compound the \ndiscrimination faced by women migrant workers and that gender-based violence is a \nform of discrimination, \n \nReaffirming the commitment to respect, protect and promote the human rights \nof all women, including, without discrimination, indigenous women who migrate for \nwork, and in this regard noting the attention paid in the United Nations Declaration \non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples20 to the elimination of all forms of violence and \ndiscrimination against indigenous women, as appropriate, \n \nStressing the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination that may be faced \nby indigenous migrant women, who suffer at a disproportionately high rate from \ndomestic violence and sexual abuse, and as victims of trafficking in persons, \n \nConcerned that many migrant women who are employed in the informal \neconomy and in less skilled work are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, \nunderlining in this regard the obligation of States to protect the human rights of \nmigrants so as to prevent and address abuse and exploitation, observing with concern \nthat many women migrant workers take on jobs for which they may be overqualified \nand in which, at the same time, they may be more vulnerable because of poor pay and \ninadequate social protection, and in this regard taking note of the adoption by the \nInternational Labour Conference on 12 June 2015, at its 104th session, of \nRecommendation No. 204 concerning the transition from the informal to the formal \neconomy, \n \nConcerned also that migrant women in informal employment may benefit only \nfrom limited legal protection of their labour rights, increasing the risk of exploitation, \n \nEmphasizing the need for objective, comprehensive and broad-based \ninformation, including sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics, and gender-\nsensitive indicators for research and analysis, and a wide exchange of experience and \nlessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of \ntargeted policies and concrete strategies to specifically address violence against \nwomen migrant workers, including in the context of discrimination, \n \nRealizing that the movement of a significant number of women migrant workers \nmay be facilitated and made possible by means of fraudulent or irregular \ndocumentation and sham marriages with the object of migration, that this may be \nfacilitated through, inter alia, the Internet and that those women migrant workers are \nmore vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, \n \nRecognizing the importance of exploring the link between migration and \ntrafficking in persons in order to further efforts towards protecting women migrant \nworkers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse and to provide \nappropriate care, assistance and services for trafficking victims, regardless of \nmigratory status, \n__________________ \n \n20  Resolution 61/295, annex. \n\nA/RES/72/149 \nViolence against women migrant workers\n \n17-22937 \n6/12 \n \n \nRecognizing also that the vulnerabilities documented for women migrant \nworkers highlight increasingly complex migration contexts and channels, where \nmigrant workers may find themselves in life-threatening situations when entering \nother countries, \n \nHighlighting measures adopted by some countries of destination to alleviate the \nplight of women migrant workers residing in their areas of jurisdiction and to promote \naccess to justice, including through the establishment of gender-sensitive protection \nmechanisms for migrant workers, by facilitating their access to mechanisms for \nreporting complaints or providing assistance during legal proceedings and by \npromoting actions to protect migrant women who are victims of violence, \n \nUnderlining the important role of relevant United Nations treaty bodies in \nmonitoring the implementation of human rights conventions and of the relevant \nspecial procedures, as well as of the supervisory mechanisms of the International \nLabour Organization, in monitoring the implementation of international labour \nstandards, within their respective mandates, in addressing the problem of violence \nagainst women migrant workers and in protecting and promoting their human rights \nand welfare, \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General;21  \n \n2. \nTakes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on the \nreview and appraisal of the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform \nfor Action and the outcomes of the twenty-third special session of the General \nAssembly,22 which highlights, inter alia, that overall progress in the implementation \nof the Platform for Action has been particularly slow for women and girls who \nexperience multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and that marginalized \ngroups of women, including migrant women, are at particular risk of discrimination \nand violence; \n \n3. \nInvites Member States to consider ratifying relevant International Labour \nOrganization conventions, including the Migration for Employment Convention \n(Revised), 1949 (No. 97),23 the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) \nConvention, 1975 (No. 143),24 the Private Employment Agencies Convention, 1997 \n(No. 181)25 and the Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189), and to consider \nsigning and ratifying or acceding to the International Convention on the Protection of \nthe Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 18 the Protocol to \nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \nChildren, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational \nOrganized Crime,26 the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and \nAir, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized \nCrime,27 the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons 28 and the \n1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness,29 as well as all other human rights \ntreaties that contribute to the protection of the rights of women migrant workers, calls \nupon States parties to comply with their relevant obligations under international law, \n__________________ \n \n21
