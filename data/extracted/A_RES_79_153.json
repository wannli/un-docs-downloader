including \ninfants and adolescents, that it has no documented health benefits, that it may give \nrise to possible adverse obstetric, prenatal and post-partum outcomes and may \nincrease vulnerability to hepatitis C, tetanus, sepsis, urine retention and ulceration, as \nwell as to fatal consequences for the mother and child, and that the elimination of this \nharmful practice can be achieved as a result of a comprehensive movement that \ninvolves all public and private stakeholders in society, including women and men, \ngirls and boys, families, communities, religious leaders and local community and \ntraditional leaders, \n \nRecognizing that female genital mutilation is inherently linked to deep-rooted \nharmful stereotypes, negative social norms, perceptions and customs on the part of \nboth women and men that threaten the physical and psychological integrity of women \nand girls, and that are obstacles to their full enjoyment of human rights, and \nacknowledging in this regard that awareness-raising is critical, \n \nRecognizing also that female genital mutilation is exacerbated in humanitarian \nsituations owing to several factors, including displacement or forced displacement \nand breakdown of law and State authority or social support networks, including lack \nof essential specialized and adequate protection and healthcare services, \n \nRecognizing further that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has \ndisrupted prevention programmes aimed at eliminating female genital mutilation and \nother harmful practices, increased the vulnerability of girls and women, especially \nthose at risk of undergoing female genital mutilation, and further exacerbated existing \ngender inequality, economic disparities and health risks faced by women and girls, \n \nWelcoming the increased national, regional and international efforts and the \npolitical commitment at the highest levels, which are critical to successfully \neradicating female genital mutilation, \n \nDeeply concerned that, despite the national, regional and international efforts, \nthe practice of female genital mutilation persists in all parts of the world, has \ninterlinkages with other harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, \nand remains underreported, particularly at the local level, and that the use of new \nmethods, such as its medicalization and cross-border practice, is increasing, \n \nRecognizing that decades of efforts to eliminate female genital mutilation are \nundermined by cross-border and transnational practices, which occur when girls or \nwomen are taken across national borders to countries that have not outlawed this \nharmful practice or do not enforce existing criminal laws,  \n \nRecognizing also that negative discriminatory and stereotypical attitudes and \nbehaviours, on the part of both women and men, have direct implications for the status \nand treatment of women and girls, and that such negative stereotypes impede the \nimplementation of legislative and normative frameworks that guarantee gender \nequality and prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, \n \nStressing that men and boys play an important role in the acceleration of \nprogress in preventing and eliminating harmful practices such as female genital \nmutilation by being agents of change, \n \nRecognizing that the campaign of the Secretary-General entitled \u201cUNiTE to End \nViolence against Women\u201d and the Global Database on Violence against Women have \ncontributed to addressing the elimination of female genital mutilation, \n\nA/RES/79/153 \nIntensifying global efforts for the elimination of female \ngenital mutilation\n \n24-24144\n4/9 \n \n \nWelcoming the efforts of the United Nations system to end female genital \nmutilation, in particular the commitment of 10 United Nations entities, 21 announced \nin their joint inter-agency statement of 27 February 2008 on eliminating female \ngenital mutilation, and taking note with appreciation of the Joint Programme on the \nElimination of Female Genital Mutilation: Delivering the Global Promise to End \nFemale Genital Mutilation by 2030 of the United Nations Population Fund and the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund, to accelerate the elimination of the practice, \n \nCommending the continued efforts and actions undertaken by States, \nindividually and collectively, regional organizations and United Nations agencies for \nthe elimination of female genital mutilation, as well as the implementation of its \nresolution 77/195, \n \nNoting with appreciation the recent progress made globally towards ending \nfemale genital mutilation, which has become less common in countries where it was \nonce universal and in countries where it occurred in only a few communities, while \nexpressing deep concern that, despite this global trend, progress is uneven and not \nfast enough to achieve the target of eliminating female genital mutilation by 2030 and \nthe promise to leave no one behind, \n \nUnderscoring the importance of eliminating female genital mutilation as a \ncontribution to the implementation of the range of Sustainable Development Goals \nand targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular target 5.3, \n \nTaking note of the report of the Secretary-General,22 \n \nDeeply concerned that a tremendous gap in resources continues to exist and that \nthe shortfall in funding has severely limited the scope and pace of programmes and \nactivities for the elimination of female genital mutilation, \n \n1. \nStresses that the gender equality and empowerment of women and girls is \nkey to breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and for the promotion and \nprotection of human rights, including the right to the enjoyment of the highest \nattainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive \nhealth, and calls upon States parties to fulfil their obligations under the Convention \non the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination against Women, as well as their commitments to implementing

in humanitarian and \nemergency preparedness and response plans and integrated in coordination mechanisms \nand remote service delivery as part of the continuum of essential services, including \nhealthcare services for all women and girls across the humanitarian-development \nnexus, with particular attention to the protection needs of women and girls living in \ncross-border communities; \n

Also urges States to ensure the protection of, and provision of support to, \nwomen and girls subjected to or at risk of female genital mutilation, including \ncross-border and transnational female genital mutilation, and to address the \nunderlying systemic and structural causes in which this harmful practice is rooted by \nestablishing regional, national and multisectoral prevention and response strategies \nthat respond to the needs of women and girls, including supportive legislation and \npolicies, programmes and budgetary measures based on integrated, coordinated and \ncollective approaches combining political commitment, civil society engagement and \naccountability at the regional, national, local and community levels; \n \n12. Further urges States to ensure that the protection of and provision of \nsupport to women and girls subject to, or at risk of, female genital mutilation are an \nintegral part of policies and programmes that address the practice, and to provide \nwomen and girls with coordinated, specialized, accessible and quality multisectoral \nprevention and response, including education, as well as legal, psychological, \nhealthcare and social services, provided by qualified personnel, consistent with the \nguidelines of medical ethics; \n \n13.
