\nconfidence-building measures; disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of \nformer combatants; demining; and conversion, \n \nNoting with satisfaction that the international community is more than ever \napplying such practical disarmament measures, especially with regard to the growing \nproblems arising from the excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread of small \narms and light weapons, including their ammunition, which pose a threat to peace and \nsecurity and reduce the prospects for economic and social development in many \nregions, particularly in post-conflict situations, \n\nA/RES/73/53 \nConsolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures\n \n18-21256\n2/3 \n \n \nWelcoming the evolution of the \u201csecond generation\u201d concept for disarmament, \ndemobilization and reintegration, which takes into account increasingly complex \npeacekeeping environments characterized by, inter alia, political instability and a \nprevalence of weapons and ammunition, and which integrates innovative approaches, \nsuch as fostering community violence reduction programmes, to better address needs \non the ground, \n \nRecalling Security Council resolution 2171 (2014) of 21 August 2014, in which \nthe Council affirmed that a comprehensive conflict prevention strategy should include \npractical disarmament and other measures to contribute to combating the proliferation \nof and illicit trade in arms,  \n \nRecalling also its resolution 71/56 of 5 December 2016 on women, \ndisarmament, non-proliferation and arms control, in which it recognized the valuable \ncontribution of women to practical disarmament measures carried out at the local, \nnational, subregional and regional levels in the prevention and reduction of armed \nviolence and armed conflict, and in promoting disarmament, non-proliferation and \narms control, \n \nEmphasizing that the meaningful participation of women must be ensured in \ndisarmament, including mine action and the control of small arms and light weapons, \n \nWelcoming the work of the United Nations Coordinating Action on Small Arms \nmechanism, which was established by the Secretary-General to bring about a holistic \nand multidisciplinary approach to the complex and multifaceted global problems \nrelated to small arms,  \n \nWelcoming also the report of the third United Nations Conference to Review \nProgress Made in the Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat \nand Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, 1 \nin which the Review Conference, inter alia, underlined the importance of the full and \neffective implementation of the Programme of Action 2  and the International \nInstrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, \nIllicit Small Arms and Light Weapons (the International Tracing Instrument) 3 for \nattaining Goal 16 and target 16.4 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 4 \nand called for the further strengthening of international cooperation and assistance \nfor the implementation of the Programme of Action and the International Tracing \nInstrument, \n \nReaffirming the importance of the early designation of the President of the \nReview Conference and the Chair of future meetings on the Programme of Action \nand the International Tracing Instrument, and encouraging the relevant regional \ngroup to make such a nomination, if possible, at least one year in advance of the \nmeeting, \n \nWelcoming the practice of the Office for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat \nin regularly providing information in presentations, in hard copy and online, \nregarding requests for assistance from States as presented in their national reports \nunder the Programme of Action,5 with a view to facilitating the matching of assistance \nneeds with available resources, \n__________________ \n \n1  A/CONF.192/2018/RC/3. \n \n2  Report of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in \nAll Its Aspects, New York, 9\u201320 July 2001 (A/CONF.192/15), chap.
