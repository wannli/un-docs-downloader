the indiscriminate killing and deliberate targeting of civilians, including \nhumanitarian workers, including those involving the continued indiscriminate use of \nheavy weapons and aerial bombardments, which has caused more than 500,000 \nfatalities, including the killing of more than 29,000 children, the continued \nwidespread and systematic gross violations, as well as abuses, of human rights and \nviolations of international humanitarian law, including by the starvation of civilians \nas a method of warfare and the use of chemical weapons, including sarin and chlorine \ngas, and sulfur mustard, which are prohibited under international law, and acts of \nviolence by the Syrian regime that foment sectarian tensions within the Syrian \npopulation, \n \nNoting with grave concern that the Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Human Rights has identified 350,209 individuals by full name, \ntogether with an established date of death and location, who were killed in the conflict \nin the Syrian Arab Republic between March 2011 and March 2021 and that, of those \nidentified, 26,727 were women and 27,126 were children, recalling also that the list \ncompiled by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \nindicates a minimum verifiable number and is certainly an undercount of the actual \nnumber of killings, \n \nReiterating that the only sustainable solution to the current crisis in the Syrian \nArab Republic is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, under the \nauspices of the United Nations, that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian \npeople in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), with a view to \nestablishing credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governance, with the full, equal and \nmeaningful participation and leadership of all women and youth at all levels, \nwelcoming the establishment of the Constitutional Committee, reaffirming in this \nregard the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and \nin peacebuilding, stressing the importance of their full, equal and meaningful \nparticipation and involvement

religious communities, \n \nWelcoming the efforts of the Special Envoy to advance United Nations efforts \nto achieve a sustainable political solution to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic \nin line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), recalling the importance of \nadvancing the work of the Constitutional Committee and achieving tangible results, \nand in that regard urging all parties to engage meaningfully in the work of the \nConstitutional Committee, particularly the Syrian regime, and underlining that a \npolitical solution to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic requires full \nimplementation of all aspects of resolution 2254 (2015), including the holding of free \nand fair elections, under the supervision of the United Nations, to the satisfaction of \nthe governance and to the highest international standards of transparency and \naccountability, with all Syrians, including displaced persons, refugees and members \nof the diaspora, eligible to participate, as well as the establishment of a neutral and \nsafe environment, noting that the recent presidential elections held in Syria were \nneither free, fair, nor consistent with the political process called for by Security \nCouncil resolution 2254 (2015), \n\nA/RES/76/228 \nSituation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic\n \n21-19659\n4/20 \n \n \nReconfirming its endorsement of the

\nSyrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition in order to end the conflict in the \nSyrian Arab Republic, and stressing that the Syrian people will decide the future of \nthe Syrian Arab Republic, \n \nWelcoming the call made by the Secretary-General for a global ceasefire and \nthat of the Special Envoy for a complete, immediate and nationwide ceasefire \nthroughout the Syrian Arab Republic, as endorsed by the Security Council in its \nresolutions 2532 (2020) of 1 July 2020 and 2565 (2021) of 26 February 2021, and \nreaffirming that Member States must ensure that any measures taken to counter \nterrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular \ninternational human rights law, international refugee law and international \nhumanitarian law, while continuing to support legitimate counter-terrorism operations \nagainst Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Da\u2019esh), Al-Qaida \nand Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham (formerly known as the Nusrah Front), and all other \nindividuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida or ISIL, and \nother terrorist groups, which have been designated by the Security Council, \n \nUrging all parties, particularly the Syrian regime, to engage meaningfully in the \npolitical process under the auspices of the Special Envoy and his office in Geneva, in \nline with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), and including the full, equal and \nmeaningful participation and representation of women in all efforts and decisions, \nwelcoming the resumption of the

security agenda of the Security Council, pursuant to Security Council resolution \n1325 (2000), and its nine subsequent resolutions, in this regard, and welcoming the \ninclusion of civil society in the political process, in particular through the Civil \nSociety Support Room and Syrian Women\u2019s Advisory Board, \n \nNoting with deep concern the culture of impunity from within the Syrian regime \nfor the most serious violations of international law and violations and abuses of \nhuman rights law committed during the present conflict, some of which rise to the \nlevel of war crimes and crimes against humanity, which has provided a fertile ground \nfor further violations and abuses, \n \nEmphasizing the importance of accountability for the most serious crimes in \nviolation of international law committed during the conflict for ensuring sustainable \npeace, \n \nRecalling all relevant resolutions on the safety and security of humanitarian \npersonnel and the protection of United Nations personnel, including its resolution \n73/137 of 14 December 2018, as well as Security Council resolutions on the \nprotection of humanitarian personnel, including resolutions 2175 (2014) of 29 August \n2014 and 2286 (2016) of 3 May 2016, the relevant statements by the President of the \nSecurity Council referring to the specific obligations under international \nhumanitarian

\nagainst hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected, including \nmakeshift hospitals, as well as attacks against medical personnel and humanitarian \nworkers that are in violation of international humanitarian law, \n \nExpressing grave concern at the continued indiscriminate use of force by the \nSyrian regime against civilians, which continues to cause immense human suffering \nand fomented the spread of violent extremism and violent extremist groups and which \ndemonstrates the continuing failure of the Syrian regime to protect the population and \nimplement the relevant resolutions and decisions of United Nations bodies and has \ncreated a safe haven and operating environment for perpetrators of war crimes and \ncrimes against humanity, \n \nExpressing grave concern also at the remaining presence of violent extremism \nand violent extremist groups, terrorists and terrorist groups, and strongly condemning \nall violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian \nlaw committed in the Syrian Arab Republic by any party to the conflict, in particular \nISIL (also known as Da\u2019esh), Al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist groups, armed groups and \nnon-State actors, and also the Syrian regime and its allies, \n \nNoting with serious concern the findings of the Independent International \nCommission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic that non-State armed groups still \nresort to the use of force against civilians, \n \nExpressing support for the work carried out by the Independent International \nCommission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, welcoming its reports, strongly \ncondemning the lack of cooperation by the Syrian regime with the Commission of \nInquiry, reiterating its decision to transmit the reports of the Commission of Inquiry to \nthe Security Council, expressing its appreciation to the Commission of Inquiry for its \nbriefings to members of the Security Council, and requesting that the Commission of \nInquiry continue to brief the General Assembly and members of the Security Council, \n \nReaffirming its condemnation in the strongest possible terms of the use of \nchemical weapons

possible terms the fact that chemical weapons have \nbeen used repeatedly in the Syrian Arab Republic, including the instances \nindependently attributed by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical \nWeapons, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations \nJoint Investigative Mechanism and the Investigation and Identification Team of the \nOrganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, noting that the Joint \nInvestigative Mechanism concluded that the Syrian Arab Armed Forces had been \nresponsible for attacks that released toxic substances in 2014 and 2015 and that ISIL \n(also known as Da\u2019esh) had used sulfur mustard in 2015 and 2016, and further \nconcluded in October 2017 that the Syrian Arab Air Force had been responsible for \nthe use of chemical weapons on 4 April 2017 in Khan Shaykhun, and noting also that \nthe Investigation and Identification Team concluded in April 2020 that there were \nreasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian Air Force had carried out three chemical \nweapons attacks in Ltamenah in March 2017 and further concluded in April 2021 that \nthere were reasonable grounds to believe the Syrian Air Force had carried out a \nchemical weapons attack in Saraqib in February 2018, \n\nA/RES/76/228 \nSituation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic\n \n21-19659\n6/20 \n \n \nNoting that the work of the

Serious Crimes under International Law \nCommitted in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011 37 and their consideration \nby the General Assembly, noting with serious concern the observation of the \nCommission of Inquiry that, since March 2011, there are reasonable grounds to \nbelieve that the Syrian regime has conducted widespread and systemic attacks against \nthe civilian population amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity, \nincluding targeted attacks on protected persons and objects, including medical \nfacilities, and personnel and transport and blocked humanitarian convoys, as well as \nenforced disappearances, torture in detention, arbitrary detentions, summary \nexecutions and other violations and abuses, and underscoring the need for those \nallegations to be examined and evidence to be collected and made available for future \naccountability efforts, \n \nStrongly condemning the reported killing of detainees in Syrian military \nintelligence facilities
