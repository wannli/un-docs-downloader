achieving the \nGoals, including in quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure to support \neconomic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and \nequitable access for all, \n \nRecognizing that international public finance, including official development \nassistance, is important to the efforts of developing countries to achieve the \nSustainable

strengthen domestic enabling environments and \nbuild essential public services, \n \nEmphasizing that the call for the contribution by the private sector to \nSustainable Development Goals financing is not a substitute for but rather an \nimportant complement to public financing,  \n \nNoting with concern that foreign direct investment has been on a weak trajectory \nsince 2015 and that, although

well as competitive investment climates at all \nlevels for developing countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,  \n \nRecognizing that socially and environmentally responsible and

Notes the potential of blended finance, including its ability to crowd in, \nleverage or catalyse additional financing, and stresses that projects should be aligned \nwith national priorities, have long-lasting development impact and be in the public \ninterest, while recognizing that for different Sustainable Development Goal \ninvestment areas, different types of finance may represent the most effective \nfinancing modalities;  \n \n27.

Emphasizes the need for technical assistance and capacity-building \nsupport for investment promotion and developing project pipelines and bankable \nprojects, in particular for developing countries;  \n \n30. Calls upon the United Nations system and all relevant stakeholders to \nsupport the capacity-building of developing countries in their efforts to close the \nSustainable Development Goals investment gaps, especially at the country \nprogramme level, on the use of public finance to leverage private investment for \nprojects benefiting sustainable development;  \n \n31.
