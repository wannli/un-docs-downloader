III. \n\nHuman rights and extreme poverty \nA/RES/73/163\n \n3/6\n18-22258 \n \nDevelopment, 18  as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of \nfundamental human rights, \n \nAcknowledging the significant progress made in several parts of the world in \ncombating extreme poverty, however, deeply concerned that extreme poverty persists \nin all countries of the world, regardless of their economic, social and cultural \nsituation, and is particularly severe in developing countries, and that it extends to and \nmanifests itself in, among other things, social exclusion, hunger, vulnerability to \ntrafficking in persons and disease, lack of adequate shelter, lack of access to basic \nservices, illiteracy and hopelessness, \n \nRemaining deeply concerned that progress has been uneven, inequality has \nincreased, 1.6 billion people still live in multidimensional poverty, the total number \nof persons living in extreme poverty remains unacceptably high and the non-income \ndimensions of poverty and deprivation, such as access to quality education or basic \nhealth services, and relative poverty remain major concerns, \n \nDeeply concerned that gender inequality, gender-based violence and \ndiscrimination exacerbate extreme poverty, disproportionally impacting women and \ngirls, recognizing the important role and contribution of women and girls in \neradicating poverty, and acknowledging the mutually reinforcing links between the \nachievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and the \neradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, \n \nRecognizing the importance of supporting countries in their efforts to eradicate \npoverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, and to promote \nthe empowerment of the poor and of people in vulnerable situations, including \nwomen, children, young people, indigenous peoples, local communities, older \npersons, persons with disabilities, migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons, \npersons belonging to national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities and people \nof African descent, \n \nConcerned by the challenges faced today, including those derived from the \nongoing impact of the financial and economic crisis, food insecurity, volatile food \nprices and other ongoing concerns over global food security, epidemics and large \nmovements of refugees and migrants, as well as the increasing challenges posed by \nclimate change and the loss of biodiversity, and by the resulting increase in the \nnumber of people living in extreme poverty, and their negative effect on the capacity \nof all States, especially developing countries, to fight extreme poverty, \n \nBearing in mind that, in order to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty \nand vulnerability, promote the well-being of all persons of all ages, boost \ndevelopment efforts, contribute to better outcomes for children and address the \nfeminization of poverty, positive action needs to be taken, including in the form of \npolicies, at the national and international levels, that address existing inequalities in \nthe distribution of services, resources and infrastructure, as well as access to food, \nhealth care, education and decent work in cities and other human settlements, \n \nRecognizing that the eradication of extreme poverty is a major challenge within \nthe process of globalization that requires the coordination and continuation of \ninclusive policies through decisive national action and international cooperation, and \nalso recognizing in this context the role of the private sector, including the corporate \nsector, in the eradication of extreme poverty, \n \nRecognizing also that social protection systems make a critical contribution to \nthe realization of human rights for all, in particular for those who are in vulnerable or \nmarginalized situations and are trapped in poverty and subject to discrimination, \n__________________ \n \n18  Resolution 41/128, annex. \n\nA/RES/73/163 \nHuman rights and extreme poverty\n \n18-22258\n4/6 \n \n \nRecognizing further that persistent and growing inequalities within and among \ncountries are a major challenge to poverty eradication, particularly affecting those \nwho are living in extreme poverty and in vulnerable situations, \n \nStressing the necessity of better understanding and addressing the \nmultidimensional causes and consequences of extreme poverty, \n \nReaffirming that, since the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the \nfull and effective enjoyment of all human rights and may, in some situations, \nconstitute a threat to the right to life, its immediate alleviation and eventual \neradication must remain a high priority for the international community, \n \nStressing that respect for all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, \ninterdependent and interrelated, is of crucial importance for all policies and \nprogrammes to fight extreme poverty, \n \nUnderlining the priority and urgency given by Heads of State and Government \nto the eradication of extreme poverty, as expressed in the outcomes of the major \nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields, \n \nReaffirming that democracy, development and the full and effective enjoyment \nof human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually \nreinforcing and that they contribute to the eradication of extreme poverty, \n \n1. \nReaffirms that extreme poverty, deep inequality and exclusion constitute a \nviolation of human dignity and that urgent national and international action is \ntherefore required to eliminate them; \n \n2. \nAlso reaffirms that it is essential for States to foster participation by the \npoorest people in the decision-making process in the societies in which they live, in \nthe promotion of human rights and in efforts to combat extreme poverty and exclusion \nand that it is essential for people living in and affected by poverty and in situations \nof vulnerability to be empowered to organize themselves and to participate in all \naspects of political, economic, social, cultural and civic life, in particular the planning \nand implementation of policies that affect them, thus enabling them to become \ngenuine partners in development; \n \n3. \nEmphasizes that extreme poverty is a major issue to be addressed by \nGovernments, the United Nations system and international financial institutions, the \nprivate sector, including the corporate sector, civil society and community-based \nsocial organizations, and in this context reaffirms that political commitment is a \nprerequisite for the eradication of poverty; \n \n4. \nAlso emphasizes the need to accord due consideration and priority to \npoverty eradication within the United Nations development agenda, while stressing \nthe importance of addressing the causes and systemic challenges of poverty through \nintegrated, coordinated and coherent strategies at the national, intergovernmental and \ninter-agency levels, consistent with the outcomes of the major United Nations \nconferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields; \n \n5. \nReaffirms that the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the \nfull and effective enjoyment of human rights, renders democracy and popular \nparticipation fragile and can also create barriers to full and effective participation in \npolitical and public life, in particular for women and girls; \n \n6. \nRecognizes the need to respect and to realize human rights and \nfundamental freedoms in order to address the most pressing social needs of people \nliving in poverty, including through the design and development of appropriate \nmechanisms to strengthen and consolidate democratic institutions and governance; \n\nHuman rights and extreme poverty \nA/RES/73/163\n \n5/6\n18-22258 \n \n \n7. \nReaffirms the commitments contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment,19 in particular to leave no one behind, to reach the furthest behind and \nthe most vulnerable and to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 1, including by \nsparing no effort to fight against and eradicate extreme poverty, which is currently \nmeasured as people living on less than 1.25 United States dollars a day, for all people \neverywhere by 2030; \n \n8. \nAlso reaffirms the commitment made at the 2005 World Summit to \neradicate poverty and promote sustained economic growth, sustainable development \nand global prosperity for all, including women and girls; 20  \n \n9. \nRecalls that promoting universal access to social services and providing \nsocial protection floors can make an important contribution to consolidating and \nachieving further development gains and that social protection systems that address \nand reduce inequality and social exclusion are essential for protecting the gains made \ntowards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, and in this regard \ntakes note of the Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), of the \nInternational Labour Organization; \n \n10. Encourages States, when designing, implementing, monitoring and \nevaluating social protection programmes, to ensure gender mainstreaming and the \npromotion and protection of all human rights in accordance with their obligations \nunder international human rights law, throughout this process; \n \n11. \nCalls upon States to implement gender-responsive social protection \npolicies, as well as fiscal policies that contribute to promoting gender equality and \nthe empowerment of all women and girls by, inter alia, facilitating greater access to \nand inclusion in social protection and financial and business services, including \ncredit, for women, in particular women heads of household; \n \n12. Encourages States to take all necessary measures to eliminate \ndiscrimination against all persons, in particular those living in poverty, to refrain from \nadopting any laws, regulations or practices denying or limiting the enjoyment of all \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, including economic, social and cultural \nrights, and to ensure that people, in particular those living in poverty, have equal \naccess to justice; \n \n13. Welcomes the ongoing efforts to strengthen and support South-South \ncooperation and triangular cooperation, recognizing their contributions to the efforts \nof developing countries to collaborate in the eradication of poverty, and stresses that \nSouth-South cooperation is not a substitute for, but rather a complement to, North-\nSouth cooperation; \n \n14. Encourages the international community to strengthen its efforts to \naddress challenges that are contributing to extreme poverty, including those derived \nfrom the ongoing impact of the financial and economic crisis, food insecurity, volatile \nfood prices and other ongoing concerns over global food security, epidemics and the \nincreasing challenges posed by climate change and the loss of biodiversity in all parts \nof the world, especially in developing countries, by enhancing cooperation to help to \nbuild national capacities; \n \n15. Reaffirms the critical role of quality education and lifelong learning for all \nin achieving poverty eradication and other development goals, as envisaged in the \n2030 Agenda, in particular free, equitable and quality primary and secondary \neducation and training for eradicating illiteracy, efforts towards expanded secondary \nand higher education as well as vocational education and technical training, especially \nfor girls and women, the creation of human resources and infrastructure capabilities \nand the empowerment of those living in poverty, also reaffirms in this context the \n__________________ \n \n19  Resolution 70/1. \n \n20  See resolution 60/1. \n\nA/RES/73/163 \nHuman rights and extreme poverty\n \n18-22258\n6/6 \n \nDakar Framework for Action, adopted at the World Education Forum on 28 April \n2000, 21  and the Incheon Declaration: Education 2030: Towards inclusive and \nequitable quality education and lifelong learning for all, adopted at the World \nEducation Forum 2015, 22  and recognizes the importance of the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization strategy for the eradication of \npoverty, especially extreme poverty, in supporting the Education for All programmes \nas tools for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4 by 2030; \n \n16.

Encourages Governments, relevant United Nations bodies, funds and \nprogrammes and the specialized agencies, other intergovernmental organizations and \nnational human rights institutions, as well as non-governmental organizations and \nnon-State actors, and the private sector, including the corporate sector, to consider the \nguiding principles in the formulation and implementation of their policies and \nmeasures concerning persons affected by extreme poverty; \n \n20.
