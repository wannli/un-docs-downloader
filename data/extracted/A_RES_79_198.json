Promoting investments for sustainable development \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nReaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled \u201cTransforming \nour world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d, in which it adopted a \ncomprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative \nSustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for \nthe full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating \npoverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest \nglobal challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its \ncommitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions \u2013 \neconomic, social and environmental \u2013 in a balanced and integrated manner, and to \nbuilding upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking \nto address their unfinished business, \n \nReaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa \nAction Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, \nwhich is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports \nand complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with \nconcrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to \naddress the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels \nfor sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity, \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety and \nwell-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the \nsevere disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives and \nlivelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the \npandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals by designing and implementing sustainable and inclusive recovery \nstrategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda \n\nA/RES/79/198 \nPromoting investments for sustainable development\n \n24-24321\n2/12 \n \nfor Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build resilience to \nfuture shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health systems and \nachieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and timely access \nfor all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and \ndiagnostics are an essential part of a global pandemic response based on unity, \nsolidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one \nbehind, \n \nRecalling its resolutions 74/199 of 19 December 2019, 75/207 of 21 December \n2020, 76/197 of 17 December 2021, 77/155 of 14 December 2022 and 78/141 of \n19 December 2023, \n \nUnderscoring that international project finance is increasingly important for \nSustainable Development Goals and climate change investment and that the strong \ngrowth performance of international project finance can be explained by favourable \nfinancing conditions, infrastructure stimulus and significant interest on the part of \nfinancial market investors to participate in projects that require multiple financiers, \nrecognizing that international project finance can enable Governments to leverage \npublic investment through private finance participation, and noting that developing \ncountries are disadvantaged in this regard and that efforts to enhance private finance \nmobilization in developing countries are particularly crucial,  \n \nExpressing concern about the findings in the World Investment Report 2024 of \nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development that international \ninvestment in sectors relevant for the Sustainable Development Goals in developing \ncountries declined in 2023 because of the downturn in international project finance, \nused for larger projects in infrastructure sectors, that project numbers in agrifood \nsystems and in water and sanitation were lower than they were in 2015 when the \nSustainable Development Goals were adopted and that investment in the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals is unequally distributed, \n \nNoting the findings in the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change that, although global tracked climate finance has shown an \nupward trend since the Fifth Assessment Report, current global financial flows for \nadaptation, including from public and private finance sources, are insufficient for and \nconstrain implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing countries, \nand that a small proportion of global tracked climate finance was targeted to \nadaptation and an overwhelming majority to mitigation,  \n \nEmphasizing that, in 2021, the bulk of tracked climate change investments was \nconcentrated in renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects, that international \nprivate investment in climate change sectors was directed almost exclusively to \nmitigation, with only 5 per cent going to adaptation projects, and that more than \n60 per cent was invested in developed countries, where 85 per cent of projects are \npurely privately financed, whereas almost half of the projects in developing countries \nrequire some form of public sector participation, while noting that investments in \nadaptation are underreported, \n \nNoting with concern that the progress on most of the Sustainable Development \nGoals is either moving much too slowly or has regressed below the 2015 baseline and \nthat, in the face of current multiple crises, years of sustainable development gains are \nbeing reversed, as millions of people, particularly in developing countries, have fallen \ninto poverty, hunger and malnutrition are becoming more prevalent, and humanitarian \nneeds are rising, \n \nHighlighting the fact that finance and investment support is needed not only for \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation, but is equally important in other \nSustainable Development Goal investment areas, \n\nPromoting investments for sustainable development \nA/RES/79/198\n \n3/12\n24-24321 \n \n \nHighlighting that the second highest Sustainable Development Goal investment \ngap is in water and sanitation, with a growing need for sustainable and innovative \ninvestments in water and sanitation to ensure progress on the implementation of \nwater-related goals and targets, \n \nNoting the urgent need to achieve zero hunger, end all forms of malnutrition, \neradicate extreme poverty and ensure rapid, inclusive and sustainable income growth \nin developing countries by adopting the right policies and stepping up investments, \nresearch and the sharing of technology on mutually agreed terms, with the \nachievement of all Sustainable Development Goals as the ultimate objective, \n \nNoting with concern that the global environment for international investment \nremains challenging in 2024 and that weakening growth prospects, economic \nfracturing trends, trade and geopolitical tensions and conflicts, industrial policies and \nsupply chain diversification are reshaping foreign direct investment patterns, causing \nsome multinational enterprises to adopt a cautious approach to overseas expansion, \n \nNoting that the crises underscore the imperative to embed long-term and risk-\ninformed thinking and sustainability into corporate and investment practices, and \nstressing that in order to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 crisis all \nstakeholders will have to work in tandem, at the same time, while the global fight \nagainst the pandemic and climate change has accelerated the momentum of \nsustainability finance and investment, with the value of sustainability-themed \ninvestment products in global capital markets growing to 7 trillion United States \ndollars in 2023, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment, recognizing that the vast majority of these funds have been invested in \ndeveloped countries, leaving \ndeveloping country investment opportunities \nsignificantly lacking, and that it is critical to scale up sustainable investments in all \ncountries, especially in developing countries, including countries in special \nsituations, \n \nEmphasizing that success in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and \nthe eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions depends on the creation of \nenabling environments at all levels, which can be supported by a reformed \ninternational financial architecture, to attract and strengthen investments towards \nactivities that promote the Goals, \n \nRecognizing that a revitalized global partnership will facilitate an intensive \nglobal engagement in support of the implementation of all of the Goals and their \ntargets, bringing together Governments, civil society, the private sector, academia, \nthe United Nations system and other actors and mobilizing all available resources, \n \nRecalling that, in the 2030 Agenda, it was acknowledged that the \nimplementation of sustainable development will depend on the active engagement of \nboth the public and private sectors and other relevant international organizations, \nincluding international financial institutions and multilateral development banks, \n \nNoting the convening of the eighth World Investment Forum of the United \nNations Conference on Trade and Development, held in Abu Dhabi from 16 to \n20 October 2023, as well as the eighth Sustainable Development Goals Investment \nFair, held in New York from 18 to 29 April 2023, \n \nWelcoming the convening of the Summit of the Future on 22\u201323 September 2024 \nat the United Nations Headquarters in New York at which resolution 79/1 of \n22 September 2024 entitled \u201cThe Pact for the Future\u201d and its annexes were adopted, \n \nLooking forward to the convening of the Fourth International Conference on \nFinancing for Development, in Seville, Spain, from 30 June to 3 July 2025, \n\nA/RES/79/198 \nPromoting investments for sustainable development\n \n24-24321\n4/12 \n \n \nNoting also the work of the United Nations in the area of investments for \nsustainable development, and taking note of the World Investment Report 2024 and \nthe SDG Investment Trends Monitor of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment, the Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2024, the \nSustainable Development Goals Report 2024 and the outcome document of the 2024 \nEconomic and Social Council forum on financing for development follow-up,1 \n \nNoting further all initiatives at the global, regional and local levels that are \naimed at scaling up the mobilization of public and private finance towards investing \nfor the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in its three dimensions and deepening \ninternational cooperation, \n \nNoting the potential of impact investment for the financing of sustainable \ndevelopment in supporting national development policies, plans, priorities and needs \nin the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, \n \nRecognizing that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require a \nshift towards long-term investment horizons, including early-stage financing, in this \nregard encouraging investors to take measures to incentivize greater long-term \ninvestment and early-stage financing, and recognizing that international public and \nprivate finance for development complemented by other innovative financing \nmechanisms, including blended finance, can play an important role in upscaling our \ncollective efforts to cover the finance needs to achieve the Sustainable Development \nGoals, \n \nUrging urgent actions to address debt sustainability problems through \nstrengthening debt crisis prevention, including through debt management and \ntransparency, finding solutions that enable countries with severe fiscal constraints and \ndebt overhangs to invest in the Sustainable Development Goals, \n \nRecognizing also that entrepreneurship can help to achieve the 2030 Agenda, \nunderlining the importance of advancing sustainable consumption and production \npatterns, and stressing the need to promote sustainable and innovative financing \nopportunities and mechanisms to unlock new capital for sustainable investment and \nupscale sustainable business models, with a special focus on micro-, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, as well as the social and solidarity economy, where \nappropriate, \n \nEmphasizing that national development efforts need to be supported by an \nenabling international economic environment, including coherent and mutually \nsupporting world trade, monetary and financial systems, and strengthened and \nenhanced global economic governance, and in this regard stressing that the likelihood \nof an increase in global foreign direct investment is further tempered by a series of \nrisk factors, \n \nEmphasizing also that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals is not \npossible without private and public investment, including long-term foreign \ninvestment, which can be mobilized when there is an enabling environment at all \nlevels, \n \nRecognizing the importance of corporate sustainability, including reporting on \nenvironmental, social and governance impacts, as appropriate, to help to ensure \ntransparency and accountability and avoid practices that counteract efforts to achieve \nthe Sustainable Development Goals, \n__________________ \n \n1 E/FFDF/2024/3. \n\nPromoting investments for sustainable development \nA/RES/79/198\n \n5/12\n24-24321 \n \n \nReaffirming the commitment to significantly increase investments to close the \ngender gap and strengthen support for institutions in relation to gender equality and \nthe empowerment of all women and girls at the global, regional and national levels, \n \nNoting with concern that investments critical to achieving the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals remain underfunded, and recognizing that additional public and \nprivate investment and financing at the national and international levels will be \nrequired to meet the large investment needs, associated with gaps, for achieving the \nGoals, including in quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure to support \neconomic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and \nequitable access for all, \n \nRecognizing that international public finance, including official development \nassistance, is important to the efforts of developing countries to achieve the \nSustainable Development Goals, including through its capacity to catalyse additional \nresource mobilization from other sources, public and private, as it can support \nimproved tax collection and help to strengthen domestic enabling environments and \nbuild essential public services, \n \nEmphasizing that the call for the contribution by the private sector to \nSustainable Development Goals financing is not a substitute for but rather an \nimportant complement to public financing, \n \nUnderlining that, in order to support the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, both public and private finance should be sustainable and \nprovided at affordable terms, \n \nEmphasizing the need to continue to scale up investments in climate action, \nincluding by making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse \ngas emissions and climate-resilient development, in line with the Paris Agreement, 2 \nand reiterating the need to accelerate the transfer and deployment of environmentally \nsound and low-emission technologies on mutually agreed terms, including on \nconcessional and preferential terms, \n \nNoting that global foreign direct investment flows declined by 2 per cent in \n2023, to 1.3 trillion dollars, though they increased by 9 per cent in developed \ncountries, they however decreased by 7 per cent in developing countries, including a \nfall of 3.3 per cent in Africa from the 54.4 billion dollars recorded in 2022 to \n52.6 billion dollars in 2023, which is 4 per cent of global foreign direct investment, \nand, despite a moderate increase in foreign direct investment flows to the economies \nof least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island \ndeveloping States, foreign direct investment remains concentrated among a few \ncountries among these structurally weak and vulnerable economies, \n \nTaking note of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development reporting \non investment in small island developing States, least developed countries and \nlandlocked developing countries, which allows for the identification of investment \ntrends in countries in special situations, indicating the need for enhancing foreign \ndirect investment to these countries, \n \nStressing that transparency and inclusion in the international financial, monetary \nand trading systems and solid institutions at all levels and the design and \nimplementation of policies, including capital market regulations, where appropriate, \nthat promote incentives along the investment chain, that are aligned with long-term \nperformance and sustainability indicators and that reduce volatility, are essential for \ninvestment promotion, sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and \nemployment creation that goes hand-in-hand with technical education and vocational \n__________________ \n \n2 See FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21, annex. \n\nA/RES/79/198 \nPromoting investments for sustainable development\n \n24-24321\n6/12 \n \ntraining in developing countries, and in this regard stressing the need for further \ninternational support as well as competitive investment climates at all levels for \ndeveloping countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, \n \nRecognizing that socially, economically and environmentally responsible, \naccountable and sustainable national and international private business activity, \ninvestment, entrepreneurship and innovation, including equal access for all women \nand youth, are major drivers of productivity, inclusive economic growth and job \ncreation, in order to leave no one behind, \n \nNoting the role of the United Nations Development Programme Istanbul \nInternational Centre for Private Sector in Development in its engagement with the \nprivate sector to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and promote inclusive \nmarkets and sustainable business development,  \n \nNoting also the finalization of the Investment Facilitation for Development \nAgreement on the occasion of the World Trade Organization Thirteenth Ministerial \nConference, and recognizing that a core objective of this Agreement is to facilitate \nthe flow of foreign direct investment between the parties, particularly to developing \nand least-developed country parties, with the aim of fostering sustainable \ndevelopment, \nthrough \nimproved \ntransparency \nof \nmeasures, \nstreamlined \nadministrative procedures, adoption of other investment facilitation measures and \npromotion of international cooperation as well as technical assistance and capacity-\nbuilding necessary for the implementation of the Agreement, \n \nRecognizing the importance of investments in technological industry and the \ndigital economy to promote connectivity and digital partnerships, and that \ndevelopment and transfer of technology on mutually agreed terms is a powerful driver \nof sustainable development and that there is a need to foster linkages between \nmultinational companies and the domestic public and private sectors, as appropriate, \nto facilitate technology development and transfer of technology on mutually agreed \nterms, \n \n1. \nEmphasizes that promoting investments in value addition and in the \nprocessing of natural resources and productive diversification ensures more inclusive \nand sustainable development, and in this regard encourages accelerated national \nefforts and the strengthening of international cooperation in areas that support \npolicies and programmes that increase public and private, domestic and international \ninvestments for structural change in the economies of developing countries; \n \n2. \nEncourages the promotion of sustainable and innovative financing \nopportunities and mechanisms to unlock new capital for sustainable investment and \nupscale sustainable business models, with a special focus on micro-, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises; \n \n3. \nCalls for the promotion of investment in developing countries for lifelong \nlearning, technical and vocational training, skills and digital

direct investment \nthat could help to diversify their economies, despite improvements in some of their \ninvestment climates; \n \n5. \nAlso notes with concern the gap in access to capital and adequate support \nservices for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular for businesses \nled by women, young entrepreneurs and persons with disabilities, and recognizes that \n\nPromoting investments for sustainable development \nA/RES/79/198\n \n7/12\n24-24321 \n \nfinancial markets as well as business support organizations can be powerful vehicles \nfor sustainable and inclusive economic growth and poverty alleviation, including \nwhen they support businesses that have a sustainable development impact and when \naccess to credit is inclusive across all segments of an economy; \n \n6. \nRecognizes that foreign direct investment can have positive spillovers, \nsuch as know-how and technology, including through establishing linkages with \ndomestic suppliers, as well as encouraging the integration of local enterprises, in \nparticular micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, into \nregional and global value chains; \n \n7.

Encourages financial actors at all levels to work towards the establishment \nof inclusive, representative and responsible financial practices, including practices \nrelated to transparency, disclosure and standards, and further encourages the efforts \nof all actors to reduce the existing and prevent further fragmentation of reporting and \ndisclosure standards, as appropriate; \n \n13. Welcomes the progress made by many countries in strengthening the \nenabling environment for private sector businesses and investments, but notes that \nmore can be done to create competitive business and investment climates, including \nby increasing efforts to combat corruption, promoting market transparency, \nimproving access to market information and easing the process of setting up \nbusinesses, that are well placed to attract private sector investment and participation \nin support of sustainable development; \n__________________ \n \n3 Resolution 70/1. \n\nA/RES/79/198 \nPromoting investments for sustainable development\n \n24-24321\n8/12 \n \n \n14. Reiterates that greater gender equality in the distribution of economic \nresources can provide the means for women to generate income and creates positive \nmultiplier effects for the achievement of inclusive, equitable and sustainable \neconomic growth, and in this regard reiterates the need for targeted actions and \ninvestments; \n \n15. Recognizes the importance of private sector engagement with national, \ninternational and intergovernmental organizations, Member States and other relevant \nstakeholders, as appropriate, in their efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development \nGoals, in an effective, accountable and consultative manner; \n \n16. Acknowledges the importance of combining international, multilateral \ndevelopment banks and government stakes in public-private partnerships to reduce \nthe cost of capital, and the need for a shift in the lending priorities of multilateral \ndevelopment banks towards better leveraging of their funds, to attract greater volumes \nof private finance into developing countries to achieve the Sustainable Development \nGoals; \n \n17. Notes the importance of sustainable corporate practices, including \nintegrating environmental, social and governance factors into company reporting, as \nappropriate, with countries deciding on the appropriate balance of voluntary and \nmandatory rules, and encourages businesses to adopt principles for responsible \nbusiness and investing; \n \n18.

Recognizes the challenges faced by developing countries in adopting new \ninternational sustainability reporting standards, leading to increased needs for \ncapacity-building, especially for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, and \nwelcomes in this context the work of the Intergovernmental Working Group of \nExperts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting for the promotion of \nsustainability reporting in developing countries; \n \n20. Calls upon Member States to reduce tensions and other risk factors and to \nfoster environments that are conducive to scaling up long-term and sustainable \ninvestments, characterized by, inter alia, open, transparent and non-discriminatory \ninvestment policies; \n \n21. Notes with concern the growing number of slum dwellers and the adverse \neffects on their health, safety and livelihood opportunities, and in this regard \nencourages targeted investments at all levels to ensure affordable and adequate \nhousing as well as sustained investment for Sustainable Development Goal targets in \nthese sectors by 2030; \n \n22. Emphasizes that the private sector can contribute to the achievement of the \n2030 Agenda in many ways, including through applying creative and innovative \nsolutions to solving sustainable development challenges, the alignment of its business \nmodels with the Sustainable Development Goals, and supporting the efforts of the \npublic sector in, inter alia, disaster risk reduction, climate action and skills \n\nPromoting investments for sustainable development \nA/RES/79/198\n \n9/12\n24-24321 \n \ndevelopment, in accordance with national plans and policies, and in this regard \nencourages further policy development and capacity-building on de-risking \ninvestments in all countries to mobilize financing; \n \n23. Welcomes the growing interest among investors in taking sustainability \nissues into account in their investment decisions, but acknowledges that further work \nis needed to analyse, monitor and measure its contribution to the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and maximize its positive development impact, and in this regard \ntakes note of the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \nin monitoring sustainable finance and Sustainable Development Goal investment \ntrends of the world\u2019s largest institutional investors through the Global Sustainable \nFinance Observatory; \n \n24. Acknowledges that reducing disaster risk, as outlined in the Sendai \nFramework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030,4 and the political declaration of \nthe high-level meeting on its midterm review, 5  is a cost-effective investment in \npreventing future losses, encourages Member States to develop standards, legislation \nand regulations, as appropriate, for disaster risk-informed public and private sector \ninvestments, including on risk disclosure in investments and transactions, and to \nensure that pipeline and bankable projects include multi-hazard and other measures \nthat assess, prevent and mitigate risks, including in infrastructure and the real estate \nsector, and in this regard encourages Member States to routinely conduct stress testing \nof infrastructure systems; \n \n25. Encourages efforts to align infrastructure plans to disaster risk reduction \nstrategies, including by engaging the insurance companies and promoting multi-\nhazard disaster risk assessments as a prerequisite for infrastructure, housing and real \nestate investments in all sectors and stress testing of critical infrastructure systems, \nwith a view to safeguarding gains in sustainable development; \n \n26.

Stresses the need to take stock of public and private initiatives to measure \ninvestment impacts on the Sustainable Development Goals, identify their similarities \nand differences, and lay out potential gaps; \n \n31. Welcomes in this regard the request, in the outcome document of the 2019 \nEconomic and Social Council forum on financing for development follow-up, to the \nInter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development to further its analysis on the \nimpact and metrics for measurement of the contribution of private sector investments \nand instruments to the Sustainable Development Goals at the global level, 6 and \nencourages international support for Member States, according to national \ncircumstances and priorities, to voluntarily develop practical tools on measuring and \ncollecting timely and reliable data on the private sector contribution towards the \nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals at the national level, as \nappropriate; \n \n32. Emphasizes that international public finance plays an important role in \ncomplementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically and \nthat official development assistance, as a critical source for development finance, \nhelps developing countries to secure sufficient public resources to invest in sectors \nthat could accelerate the delivery of the transformational ambition of the 2030 \nAgenda, and notes in this regard the need to intensify efforts to meet respective \ncommitments, focusing the most concessional resources on those with the greatest \nneeds and least ability to mobilize other resources; \n \n33. Notes the potential of blended finance, including its ability to crowd in, \nleverage or catalyse additional financing, and stresses that projects should be aligned \nwith national priorities, have long-lasting development impact and be in the public \ninterest, including those in vulnerable situations, while recognizing that, for different \nSustainable Development Goal investment areas, different types of finance may \nrepresent the most effective financing modalities; \n \n34.
