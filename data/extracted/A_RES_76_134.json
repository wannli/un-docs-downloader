\nincreasing life expectancy, reducing maternal, newborn and child mortality and \ncombating communicable diseases,  \n \nRecognizing that action to achieve universal health coverage by 2030 is

development, leaving more people behind and that it has also had \na negative impact on the abilities of Governments to realize the 2030 Agenda and \nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals, stressing that at this critical moment in \nthe decade of action to deliver the Goals by 2030 the visions, principles and \ncommitments made at the World Summit for Social Development remain valid and \nare central to addressing emerging global challenges, and recalling that social policies \nhave a key role to play in addressing the immediate effects of crises,  \n \nDeeply concerned that the

\n4. \nRecognizes that poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon, and \nencourages Member States to develop comprehensive, integrated and coherent \npoverty eradication strategies that effectively

deep concern that the global goal of eradicating poverty in all its \nforms and dimensions by 2030 is slipping from our reach, and recognizes that the \nmultidimensional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated it, increasing \nthe number of people living in poverty by up to 124 million, causing the extreme poverty \nrate to rise for the first time in a generation, especially low- and middle-income \ncountries, and, inter alia, among women and girls and persons with disabilities; \n \n6. \nStresses the importance of taking targeted measures to eradicate poverty \nin all its forms and dimensions everywhere, including extreme poverty, with enhanced \ninternational support and strengthened global partnerships, and notes the need for \ncountries, the United Nations

adopt measures to recognize, reduce and \nredistribute women\u2019s and girls\u2019 disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic \nwork and the feminization of poverty, which is exacerbated by

Reaffirms that social integration policies should seek to reduce \ninequalities, promote access to basic social services, quality education for all and \nhealth care, eliminate discrimination, increase the participation and integration of \nsocial groups, particularly young people, older persons and persons with disabilities, \nnoting the role of sports in this regard, and address the challenges posed to social \ndevelopment by globalization and market-driven reforms in order for all people in all \ncountries to benefit from globalization;  \n \n13. Stresses that an enabling environment is a critical precondition for \nachieving equity and social development and that, while economic growth is essential, \nentrenched inequality and marginalization are an obstacle to the broad-based and \nsustained growth required for sustainable, inclusive and people-centred development, \nand recognizes the need to balance and ensure complementarity between measures to \nachieve growth and measures to achieve economic and social equity and inclusion in \norder for there to be an impact on overall poverty levels;  \n \n14. Acknowledges that investment in human capital and social protection has \nbeen proven to be effective in reducing poverty and inequality, and invites Member \nStates to mobilize innovative sources of financing, including through public-private \npartnerships, to secure adequate levels of social expenditure necessary for expanding \ncoverage towards universal access to health education, innovation, new technologies \nand basic social protection and to address the issues of illicit financial flows and \ncorruption;  \n \n15. Stresses that international trade and stable financial systems can be \neffective tools to create favourable conditions for the development of all countries \nand that trade barriers and some trading practices continue to have negative effects \non employment growth, particularly in developing countries, that good governance \nand the rule of law at the national and international levels and the need to promote \nrespect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are essential for sustained \neconomic growth, sustainable development, the reduction of inequalities, the \neradication of poverty, hunger and malnutrition and for addressing the most pressing \nsocial needs of people living in poverty, and in this regard also stresses the importance \nof economic, social and cultural rights and the importance of the principles of \n__________________ \n \n20  A/57/304, annex. \n\nImplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for Social \nDevelopment and of the twenty-fourth special session of the \nGeneral Assembly \nA/RES/76/134\n \n9/17\n21-19158 \n \nnon-discrimination, inclusivity and meaningful participation for the implementation \nof the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development; \n \n16.

Urges Member States to strengthen social policies, as appropriate, paying \nparticular attention to the specific needs of disadvantaged and marginalized social \ngroups, inter alia, women, children, youth, persons with disabilities, people living \nwith HIV/AIDS, older persons, indigenous peoples, refugees, internally displaced \npersons, migrants and other persons in vulnerable situations, as well as to address all \nforms of violence in its many manifestations, including domestic violence, and \ndiscrimination, including xenophobia, against them, to ensure that these groups are \nnot left behind, and recognizes that violence increases the challenges faced by States \nand societies in the achievement of poverty eradication, full and productive \nemployment and decent work for all, and social integration;  \n \n18. Reaffirms the commitment to gender equality and the empowerment of all \nwomen and girls, as well as to the mainstreaming of a gender perspective into all \ndevelopment efforts, recognizing that they are critical for achieving sustainable \ndevelopment and for efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition, poverty and disease, \nto strengthening policies and programmes that improve, ensure and broaden the full \nparticipation of women in all spheres of political, economic, social and cultural life \nas equal partners and to improving the access of women to all resources needed for \nthe full exercise of all their human rights and fundamental freedoms by removing \npersistent barriers and allocating adequate resources for the elimination of all forms \nof violence and discrimination against women, including in the workplace, inter alia, \nby addressing wage inequality, ensuring equal access to full and productive \nemployment and decent work for all, reconciliation of work and private life for both \nmen and women, as well as strengthening their economic independence;  \n \n19.
