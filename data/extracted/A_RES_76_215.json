technologies globally, on mutually agreed terms, as well \nas capacity-building, are also critical, including pursuing policy coherence and an \nenabling environment for sustainable development at all levels and by all actors and \nreinvigorating the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development and for the \nachievement of the 2030 Agenda, \n \nRecognizing that, as per capita income increases above low-income thresholds, \naccess to external public finance often decreases faster than can be offset by \ncommensurate increases in tax revenues in per capita terms, \n \nRecognizing also that the enhanced and revitalized Global Partnership for \nSustainable Development, led by Governments, will be a vehicle for strengthening \ninternational cooperation and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, while noting \nthat multi-stakeholder partnerships and the resources, knowledge and ingenuity of the \nprivate sector, civil society, the scientific community, academia, philanthropy and

and that \ndevelopment cooperation by the United Nations development system should respond \nto the varying development needs of programme countries, including those of middle-\nincome countries, in a manner that addresses their specific challenges while mindful \nof their diversity, and recognizing also that revitalized, strategic, flexible and results- \nand action-oriented United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation \nFrameworks should be prepared and finalized in full consultation and agreement with \nnational Governments and aligned with national development plans, strategies and \ncircumstances in support of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, \n \nNoting that, over the past 15 years, 29 low-income countries have transitioned \nto middle-income country status,

the actual particularities and development needs of middle-\nincome countries and that, despite notable progress in reducing poverty levels in both \nabsolute and relative terms, poverty remains a problem in many middle-income \ncountries, as they are still home to 62 per cent of the world\u2019s people living in poverty, \n\nA/RES/76/215 \nDevelopment cooperation with middle-income countries\n \n21-19278\n4/8 \n \n \nNoting further the willingness to develop a wider analysis of new measures, \nbuilding on existing experiences with eligibility exception, for concessional finance \nand

malnutrition has \nbeen increasing in many countries, exacerbated by the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic, with 54 out of 66 countries experiencing an increase in the \nprevalence of

\nRecognizing that inequality, or even a rise in inequality, remains pervasive in \nmiddle-income countries, even in those with high levels of economic growth, that \nfurther investments in social services and economic opportunities are needed in order \nto reduce inequalities and that economic growth needs to be sustained, inclusive and \nequitable, \n \nStressing that middle-income countries continue to face challenges related to, \ninter alia, job creation, natural resource management, reliance on primary commodity \nexports, the adverse effects of disaster risks and climate change, high levels of \nexternal debt and the volatility of exchange rates and capital flows and, in this regard, \nthat efforts to create a national enabling environment for development should be \ncomplemented by a global enabling environment, \n \nStressing also the importance that middle-income countries need access to and \ndevelopment of better technologies, research and innovation and better management \npractices, which can foster skills development, boost productivity and achieve \nsustainable and inclusive growth, \n \nRecognizing that connectivity through quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient \ninfrastructure, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all, contributes to \nthe sustainable development of middle-income countries, \n \nRecalling that, for all countries,

appropriate, through \nmodernized tax systems, more efficient tax collection, the broadening of the tax base \nand the effective combating of tax evasion and capital flight, and reiterating that, \nwhile each country is responsible for its tax system, it is important to support national \nefforts in these areas by strengthening technical assistance and enhancing \ninternational cooperation and participation in addressing international tax matters, \n \nRecalling further the importance of international support, in various forms, \nincluding North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation, that is well aligned \nwith national priorities to contribute to addressing the development needs of middle-\nincome countries, including through capacity-building, \n \nRecognizing the need to better understand the multidimensional nature of \ndevelopment and poverty, and acknowledging the significant role that the United \nNations system has played and should continue to play in this regard, \n \nExpressing concern that climate change is adversely affecting productivity in \nevery country, in particular developing countries, including middle-income countries, \nas extreme weather shocks directly affect productivity through the destruction of \ninfrastructure and labour force displacement, and that a number of middle-income \n\nDevelopment cooperation with middle-income countries \nA/RES/76/215\n \n5/8\n21-19278 \n \ncountries have sizeable sectors that are exposed to climate change, such as \nagriculture, construction, mining, tourism and transport, \n \nReaffirming that achieving gender equality, empowering all women and girls, \nand the full realization of their human rights are essential to achieving sustained, \ninclusive and equitable economic growth and

total external debt grew by over 25 per cent \nbetween 2016 and 2019, that the current debt represents 29.4 per cent of their \ncombined gross domestic product and that the debt of middle-income countries is not \nonly growing at a faster pace than anticipated but is a more costly debt with a shorter \nmaturity, \n \nReiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind, reaffirming the \nrecognition that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, and the wish to see \nthe Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society, \nand recommitting to endeavour to reach the furthest behind first,  \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety \nand well-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic,

towards the full implementation of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build \nresilience to future shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health \nsystems and achieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and \ntimely access for all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, \ntherapeutics and diagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, \nsolidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one \nbehind, \n \nNoting with concern that the COVID-19 pandemic, apart from creating an \nunprecedented global public health crisis and affecting the most vulnerable \npopulations, has had a devastating effect on the economies of middle-income \ncountries, including those moving into higher income, through the introduction of \nlockdowns and suspensions of economic activity leading to rising extreme poverty \nand food insecurity, gender inequality, unprecedented job losses, disruptions in \nregional and global production chains and stagnating international trade, excessive \nvolatility of commodity prices, shrinking remittances and numerous other channels, \na decline in global foreign direct investment, the sharp contraction in the already \nlimited fiscal space and the bleak economic outlook that has suppressed investment, \nundermining future growth prospects and long-term productivity trends,  \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General;6  \n \n2. \nAcknowledges the efforts made
