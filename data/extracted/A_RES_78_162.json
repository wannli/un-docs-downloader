\nequitable,  \n \nStressing that middle-income countries continue to face challenges related to, \ninter alia, job creation, natural resource management, reliance on primary commodity \nexports, the adverse effects of disaster risks and climate change, high levels of \nexternal debt and the volatility of exchange rates and capital flows and, in this regard, \nthat efforts to create a national enabling environment for development should be \ncomplemented by an international enabling environment,  \n \nStressing also the importance for middle-income countries of having access to, \nand development of better technologies, research and innovation and better \nmanagement practices, which can foster skills development, boost productivity and \nachieve sustainable and inclusive growth,

\nExpressing concern that climate change is adversely affecting productivity in \nevery country, in particular developing countries, including middle-income countries, \nas extreme weather shocks directly affect productivity through the destruction of \ninfrastructure and labour force displacement, and that a number of middle-income \ncountries have sizeable sectors that are exposed to climate change, such as agriculture, \nconstruction, mining, tourism and transport,  \n \nReaffirming that achieving gender equality, the empowerment of all women and \ngirls and the full realization of their human rights are essential to achieving sustained, \ninclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development, and in that \nregard reiterating the need for gender mainstreaming, including

of \nlockdowns and suspensions of economic activity leading to rising extreme poverty \nand food insecurity, gender inequality, unprecedented job losses, disruptions in \nregional and global production chains and stagnating international trade, excessive \nvolatility of commodity prices, shrinking remittances and numerous other channels, a \ndecline in global foreign direct investment,

negotiated \nin good faith;  \n \n6. \nCalls for improved international debt mechanisms to support debt review, \ndebt payment suspensions and debt restructuring, as appropriate, with an expansion
