the Chair was guided by the following \nconsiderations:  \n \n(a) \nIn accordance with established procedures and practices and bearing in \nmind the availability of documentation, the Committee may wish to hold one joint \ngeneral debate covering agenda items 54 to 58 and individual debates on agenda \nitems 46 to 53, 59, 121 and 137, on the understanding that draft resolutions and/or \ndecisions will be considered separately;  \n \n(b) \nRepresentatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories and petitioners will be \nheard as early as possible during the Committee\u2019s consideration of the related items, \nand the Chair suggests that the Committee devote its meetings from Tuesday, \n7 October to Monday, 13 October, to the hearing of petitioners;  \n \n(c) \nItem 121, Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly, is allocated \nto all the Main Committees for the sole purpose of considering and taking action on \ntheir respective tentative programme of work;  \n\nA/C.4/80/L.1 \n \n25-14603\n8/8 \n \n \n(d) \nItem 137, Programme planning, is allocated to all the Main Committees \nand the plenary of the General Assembly to enhance the discussion of evaluation, \nplanning, budgeting and monitoring reports. If the Assembly allocates any report \nsubmitted under this item to the Fourth Committee, the Committee shall revert to this \nitem.  \n6. \nSubject to the provisional programme of work above being acceptable to the \nCommittee and in order to facilitate its work, the Chair wishes to suggest that the list \nof speakers in the general debate for the respective agenda items be closed as \nindicated in the timetable above.  \n7. \nThe Chair also wishes to draw the attention of members of the Committee to the \ndecisions of the General Assembly on the organization of its work contained in \ndocument A/80/250, sections II.B to III.  \n8. \nMembers are also requested to bear in mind the decision of the General \nAssembly that morning and afternoon meetings should start promptly at 10 a.m. and \n3 p.m., respectively, both for plenary meetings and for meetings of the Main \nCommittees during the eightieth session. The attention of the members is also drawn \nto the decision of the Assembly to waive, at its eightieth session, the quorum required, \nunder rule 108 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, for the Chair to \ndeclare a meeting open and permit the debate to proceed (see A/80/250, para. 8).  \n9. \nIn view of the limited number of meetings available to the Committee, it is \nsuggested that the time limit for statements be set at 10 minutes, with the exception \nof statements made by the spokespersons of groups of delegations, which would be \nextended to 15 minutes. In this connection, the Chair will set the time limit for the \npetitioners as deemed necessary.  \n10.
