Follow-up to and implementation of the SIDS Accelerated \nModalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway and the Mauritius \nStrategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of \nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small Island \nDeveloping States \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nReaffirming that the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) \nPathway 1  is a stand-alone, overarching framework setting out the sustainable \ndevelopment priorities of small island developing States that builds on the \nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates2 and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme \nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, 3 and \nrecognizing that the Samoa Pathway is consistent with the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development,4 including the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third \nInternational Conference on Financing for Development, 5 and is in line with the \n__________________ \n \n1 Resolution 69/15, annex. \n \n2 Report of the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates, Bridgetown, Barbados, 25 April\u20136 May 1994 (United Nations publication, Sales \nNo. E.94.I.18 and corrigenda), chap.

Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030,6 the New Urban Agenda7 \nand the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change,8 \n \nReaffirming also that small island developing States remain a special case for \nsustainable development, renewing thus our solidarity with them, as they continue to \nface the combined challenges arising, in particular, from their geographical \nremoteness, the small scale of their economies, high costs and the adverse effects of \nclimate change and natural disasters, and remaining particularly concerned that many \nsmall island developing States have not achieved sustained high levels of economic \ngrowth, owing in part to their vulnerabilities to the ongoing negative impacts of \nenvironmental challenges and external economic and financial shocks, \n \nNoting with great concern the threat to human health, safety and well-being \ncaused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the severe \ndisruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives and \nlivelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the \npandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals by designing sustainable and inclusive recovery strategies to \naccelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda and to help \nto reduce the risk of future shocks, and recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic \nrequires a global response based on unity, solidarity and renewed multilateral \ncooperation, \n \nAcknowledging the severe consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the \nsustainable development of small island developing States envisioned in the Samoa \nPathway and the 2030 Agenda, including the far-reaching and enduring consequences \nfor poverty eradication, employment, growth and social welfare as a result of the \nunprecedented contraction of their economies, and noting with concern that the \nexternal debt stocks of small island developing States have increased by \n70 percentage points since 2009, resulting in the average rate of external debt to gross \ndomestic product in those States rising by 11 percentage points to 61.7 per cent in \n2019, while the ability of those States to self-insure against exogenous shocks \ncontinues to deteriorate further, highlighting that achieving the Goals and targets set \nout in the 2030 Agenda will be more difficult and that integrating the concept of \nresilience is critical to enable a sustainable future and avoid creating new risks, \n \nAcknowledging also the need for urgent action to address the adverse impacts \nof climate change, including those related to sea level rise and extreme weather \nevents, which continue to pose a significant risk to small island developing States and \nto their efforts to achieve sustainable development and, for many, represent the \ngravest of threats to their survival and viability, including, for some, through loss of \nterritory, as well as through threats to water availability and food security and \nnutrition, \n \nTaking note with concern of the findings contained in the recent reports of the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in particular the special reports entitled \nGlobal Warming of 1.5\u00b0C, Climate Change and Land and The Ocean and Cryosphere \nin

climate \nchange in small island developing States, \n \nNoting the importance of oceans, seas and marine resources to small island \ndeveloping States, acknowledging their efforts to develop and implement strategies \nfor the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its resources, in this regard \nreiterating the call made in the declaration entitled \u201cOur ocean, our future: call for \naction\u201d,9 encouraging the fulfilment of voluntary commitments pledged in the context \nof the United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 14:
