international legal standards for the \nprotection and well-being of children; \n \n2. \nRecognizes that, while progress has been made, many challenges remain, \nand that, in this regard, both the high-level commemorative event on 25 September \n2019 and the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on 20 November 2019 were \noccasions for States to reflect on implementation gaps and to take additional measures \nto ensure that the rights of children are fully realized; \n \n3. \nCalls upon States parties to increase their efforts for the full \nimplementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; \n \n4. \nReaffirms paragraphs 1 to 5 of its resolution 71/177 of 19 December 2016 \nand that the general principles of, inter alia, the best interests of the child,

parties to the \nConvention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols thereto as a matter \nof priority and to implement them effectively, and encourages further efforts by the

to \nconsider reviewing regularly other reservations with a view to withdrawing them in \naccordance with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action;15 \n \n7. \nNotes the work of the Special

Urges States to improve the situation of children living in poverty, in \nparticular extreme poverty, deprived of adequate food and nutrition, water and \nsanitation facilities, with limited or no access to basic physical and mental health-\ncare services, shelter, education, participation and protection, taking into account that, \nwhile a severe lack of goods and services hurts every human being, it is particularly \nthreatening and harmful to children, leaving them unable to enjoy their rights, to reach \ntheir full potential and to participate as full members of society, and exposed to \nconditions that lead to increased violence; \n \n13. Calls upon States to scale up scientifically accurate and age-appropriate \ncomprehensive education, relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls \nand boys and young women and men, in and out of school, consistent with their \nevolving capacities, and with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and \nlegal guardians, with the best interests of the child as their basic concern, with \ninformation on sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention, gender equality \nand women\u2019s empowerment, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal \ndevelopment and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to \nbuild self-esteem and foster informed decision-making, communication and risk-\nreduction skills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young \npeople, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in \norder to, inter alia, enable them protect themselves from HIV infection and other \nrisks; \n \n14. Reaffirms the right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and \nnon-discrimination, and calls upon States to make primary education compulsory, \ninclusive and available free to all children, ensuring that all children have equal access \nto education of good quality, making secondary education generally available and \naccessible to all, in particular through the progressive introduction of free education, \nbearing in mind that special measures to ensure equal access, including affirmative \naction, contribute to achieving equal opportunity and combating exclusion by \neliminating social, economic and gender disparities in education and ensuring school \n\nRights of the child \nA/RES/74/133\n \n7/15\n19-22229 \n \nattendance, in particular for girls, children with disabilities, pregnant adolescent girls, \nchildren living in poverty, indigenous children, children of African descent, persons \nbelonging to ethnic or religious minorities and children in vulnerable or marginalized \nsituations; \n \n15.

Strongly condemns all forms of violence against children in all settings, \nincluding physical, psychological and sexual violence, torture and other cruel, \ninhuman or degrading treatment, child abuse and exploitation, hostage-taking, \ndomestic violence, incest, trafficking in or sale of children and their organs, \npaedophilia, child prostitution, child pornography and other child sexual abuse \nmaterial, child sex tourism, gang and armed violence, sexual exploitation of children \nonline and offline, bullying, including cyberbullying, and harmful practices, \nincluding female genital mutilation and child, early and forced marriage, and urges \nStates to strengthen efforts to prevent and protect children from all such violence \nthrough a comprehensive, gender-responsive and age-appropriate approach and to \ndevelop an inclusive multifaceted and systematic framework, which is integrated into \nnational planning processes, to respond effectively to violence against children and \nto provide for safe and child-sensitive counselling, complaint and reporting \nmechanisms and safeguards for the rights of affected children;  \n \n17. Calls upon all States to protect the human rights of all children and to \nensure, for children belonging to minorities in vulnerable situations, including \nmigrant children, indigenous children, children of African descent, internally \ndisplaced children and children with disabilities, the enjoyment of all human rights \nas well as access to health care, social services, social protection and accessible and \ninclusive education on an equal basis with others, and to ensure that all such children, \nin particular unaccompanied migrant children, internally displaced children and those \nwho are victims of violence and exploitation, receive special protection and assistance \nand that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in their policies of \nintegration, return and family reunification; \n \n18. Condemns in the strongest terms all violations and abuses committed \nagainst children in armed conflict, and in this regard urges all States and other parties \nto armed conflict that are engaged, in contravention of applicable international law, \nin the recruitment and use of children, in patterns of killing and maiming of children \nand/or rape and other sexual violence against children, acknowledging that sexual \nviolence in these situations disproportionately affects girls, but that boys are also \ntargets, in recurrent attacks on schools and/or hospitals and related personnel and in \npatterns of abduction of children, as well as in all other violations and abuses against \nchildren, to take time-bound and effective measures to end and prevent them and to \nencourage age- and gender-specific support services, including psychological, social \nand sexual and reproductive health-care services, and education, social protection and \nreintegration programmes; \n \n19. Calls upon all Member States to ensure that children associated or \nallegedly associated with armed groups should be treated primarily as victims and in \nline with the best interests of the child, and to consider non-judicial measures as \nalternatives to prosecution and detention and take measures that focus on \nrehabilitation and reintegration in an environment that fosters the health, self-respect \nand dignity of the child, in accordance with relevant provisions of international \nhumanitarian law, as well as human rights law, in particular the Convention on the \nRights of the Child;  \n\nA/RES/74/133 \nRights of the child\n \n19-22229\n8/15 \n \n \n20. Calls upon States to protect children affected by armed conflict, in \nparticular from violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, \nand to ensure that they receive timely, effective humanitarian assistance, noting the \nefforts taken to end impunity by ensuring accountability and punishing perpetrators, \nand calls upon the international community to hold those responsible for violations \naccountable, inter alia, through the International Criminal Court;  \n \n \n \nI \nChildren without parental care \n \n \n21. Recalls that the Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes that a \nchild, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality and potential, \nshould grow up in a family environment and that a child temporarily or permanently \ndeprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be \nallowed to remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special protection and \nassistance provided by the State, and that States parties shall, in accordance with their \nnational laws and their obligations under the relevant international instruments in this \nfield, ensure safe and appropriate quality alternative care for such a child; \n \n22. Urges all States parties to intensify their efforts to comply with their \nobligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child to preserve the identity \nof children, including their nationality, name and family relations, as recognized by \nlaw, to protect children in matters relating to birth registration, family relations and \nadoption or other forms of alternative care, recognizing that every effort should be \ndirected to enabling children to remain in or swiftly return to the care of their parents \nor, when appropriate, other close family members and that, where alternative care is \nnecessary, family and community-based care should be promoted over placement in \ninstitutions; \n \n23. Recalls that the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 5 \nrequires all States parties to ensure the full enjoyment by children with disabilities of \nall human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children, \nincluding with respect to family life;  \n \n24. Reaffirms that children shall not be separated from their parents against \ntheir will except when competent authorities, subject to judicial review, determine, in \naccordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for \nthe best interests of the child and that such determination may be necessary in a \nparticular case such as one involving abuse or neglect of the child by the parents or \none where the parents are living separately and a decision must be made as to the \nchild\u2019s place of residence;  \n \n25. Also reaffirms that a child shall not be deprived of his or her liberty \nunlawfully or arbitrarily and that the arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall \nbe in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and \nfor the shortest appropriate period of time, and that every child deprived of liberty \nshall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human \nperson, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or \nher age;  \n \n26. Notes that children without parental care are more likely than their peers \nto experience human rights violations, such as exclusion, violence, abuse, neglect and \nexploitation, and in this regard expresses deep concern on the potential harm of \ninstitutionalization and institutional care to children\u2019s growth and development; \n \n27. Recognizes that many children living without parental care have families, \nincluding at least one parent alive and/or relatives, and in this regard encourages \nactions to achieve family reunification unless it is not in the best interests of the child; \n\nRights of the child \nA/RES/74/133\n \n9/15\n19-22229 \n \n \n28. Stresses that no child should be forced to give up family connections in \norder to escape poverty, or to receive care, comprehensive, timely and quality health \nservices or education, or because they are in contact with the law;  \n \n29. Recognizes that poverty, all forms of violence, including mental and \nphysical violence, domestic violence, structural violence and survival activities may \nlead children into the criminal justice system, including the juvenile justice system, \nand that detention in the criminal justice system is sometimes used as a substitute for \nprevention and referral to child protection authorities and services; \n \n30. Also recognizes that financial and material poverty, or conditions directly \nand uniquely imputable to such poverty, should never be the only justification for the \nremoval of a child from the care of his or her parents or primary caregivers and legal \nguardians, for receiving a child into alternative care or for preventing his or her \nreintegration, but should be seen as a signal for the need to provide appropriate \nsupport to their family, benefiting the child directly;  \n \n31. Urges States to strengthen child welfare and child protection systems and \nimprove care reform efforts, which should include increased multisectoral \ncollaboration, inter alia, between child welfare and health, education and justice \nsectors, active coordination among all relevant authorities, improved cross-border \nsystems and improved capacity-building and training programmes for relevant \nstakeholders;  \n \n32. Expresses deep concern regarding the large and growing number of \nmigrant children, particularly those who are unaccompanied or separated from their \nparents or primary caregivers, who may be particularly vulnerable along their journey, \nand expresses the commitment to protect the human rights of migrant children, given \ntheir vulnerability, in particular unaccompanied migrant children and migrant \nchildren with disabilities, to ensure that they receive appropriate protection and \nassistance and to provide for their health, education and psychosocial development, \nensuring that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in policies on \nintegration, return and family reunification; \n \n33. Calls upon States to take all measures necessary to prevent and combat \nillegal adoptions and all adoptions that are not in the best interests of the child;  \n \n34. Urges States to take effective action to provide support to families and to \nprevent the unnecessary separation of children from their parents, including by: \n \n(a) \nPrioritizing investments in child protection services and social services to \nsupport quality alternative care, including families and communities in order to \nprevent the separation of children from their families, with the best interests of the \nchild as the primary consideration; \n \n(b) \nAdopting and enforcing laws and improving the implementation of \npolicies and programmes, budget allocation and human resources to support children, \nparticularly children with disabilities and children living in disadvantaged, \nstigmatized and marginalized families, to address the root causes of unnecessary \nfamily separation and ensure that they are cared for effectively by their own families \nand communities;
