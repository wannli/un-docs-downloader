and sanitation\n \n21-19189\n4/9 \n \ntypes of facilities used and the level of service received, including accessibility, \navailability and quality, and estimates on inequalities disaggregated by rural and \nurban, subnational regional and wealth quintile for an increasing number of countries, \nand noting the fact that it has an extensive global database and has developed global \nnorms to benchmark progress, including most recently on affordability, while taking \ninto consideration the fact that official figures very often do not fully capture all the \ndimensions of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, \n \nWelcoming further the fact that, globally, between 2015 and 2020, according to \nthe Joint Monitoring Programme, the percentage of the population using safely \nmanaged drinking water increased from 70 to 74 per cent, and the percentage of the \npopulation using safely managed sanitation services increased from 47 to 54 per cent, \n \nDeeply concerned that, more than 10 years after the adoption of resolution \n64/292, 2 billion people lack safely managed drinking water services, including \n1.2 billion people with basic services, 282 million with limited services, 367 million \nusing unimproved sources and 122 million drinking surface water, while 3.6 billion \npeople lack safely managed sanitation, including 1.9 billion people with basic \nservices, 580 million with limited services, 616 million using unimproved facilities \nand 494 million practising open defecation,  \n \nDeeply concerned also that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic \nperpetuates and exacerbates existing inequalities, and that those disproportionately at \nrisk are women, girls and persons in vulnerable situations, recognizing the need to \nexpand as a matter of utmost urgency access to adequate water and sanitation services, \nincluding for menstrual health and hygiene management, and to ensure continued \naccess to existing services in this regard, including sexual and reproductive health-\ncare services, and gravely concerned that 2.3 billion people worldwide lack basic \nhand-washing facilities at home, which is urgently needed to prevent the spread of \nCOVID-19 and other infectious diseases,  \n \nRecognizing that hygiene, including hand hygiene, and access to adequate water \nand sanitation services are essential for preventing the emergence and spread of \ninfectious diseases that can have a negative impact on the enjoyment of all human \nrights, and highlighting in this regard the importance of urgent universal and equitable \naccess to safe drinking water and sanitation, including through enhanced investment, \nas a crucial aspect of pandemic preparedness and response,  \n \nDeeply concerned about the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation \nservices and its dramatic consequences for the overall health situation in humanitarian \nemergencies and crises, including in times of conflict and natural disaster, and \nacknowledging that people living in countries affected by armed conflict and natural \ndisasters and in countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate \nchange, as well as people living in refugee camps, including in refugee host countries, \nare more likely to lack access to basic drinking water and to basic sanitation than \npeople living in unaffected countries, while acknowledging the efforts of refugee host \ncountries in improving the situation of people living in refugee camps,  \n \nDeeply concerned also that achieving universal and equitable access to safe \nwater and sanitation services by 2030 will require a fourfold increase in current rates \nof progress,  \n \nDeeply concerned further that women and girls often face, especially in \nhumanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural \ndisaster, particular barriers in accessing water and sanitation and hygiene services, as \nwell as menstrual health and hygiene management, and that they shoulder the main \nburden of collecting household water and of care responsibilities, including those \narising from waterborne diseases, in many parts of the world, restricting their time \n\nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation \nA/RES/76/153\n \n5/9\n21-19189 \n \nfor other activities, such as education and leisure, or, for women, for earning a \nlivelihood,  \n \nDeeply alarmed that water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases hit children \nthe hardest, while noting that child diarrhoea remains a leading cause of death in \nchildren under 5 years of age, and underscoring that progress on reducing child \nmortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children\u2019s and women\u2019s universal and \nequitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation and that, in humanitarian \nemergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural disaster, \nchildren suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services,  \n \nDeeply concerned that persons with disabilities, especially children, often lack \nuniversal and equitable access to safe and sustainably managed drinking water and \nsanitation and face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities that are \naccessible and appropriate to their needs, which has an impact on their ability to live \nindependently and participate fully in all aspects of life, including education and \nemployment, which is particularly concerning in situations of homelessness and \nhumanitarian emergencies and crises,  \n \nDeeply alarmed by indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting \ncivilian objects in armed conflict, which may injure personnel and damage civilian \ninfrastructure that is critical to the delivery of essential services to the civilian \npopulation,  \n \nDeeply concerned that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation \nand menstrual health and hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic \ninformation and education thereon, whether in school or out of school, and are \nexcluded and stigmatized, that the enjoyment of their human rights, including the \nright to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, \ncan be negatively affected and that they are thus prevented from realizing their full \npotential, \n \nDeeply concerned also that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation \nservices, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, especially in \nschools and other educational settings, workplaces, health centres and public facilities \nand at home, negatively affects gender equality, the empowerment of women and girls \nand their enjoyment of human rights, including the right to education and the right to \nthe enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and \nrecognizing the specific hygiene needs of women and girls during menstruation, and \nthat women have specific hygiene needs during pregnancy, childbearing and rearing \nand throughout the life course, \n \nDeeply concerned further that women and girls are particularly at risk of and \nexposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to \ntheir safety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities \noutside their homes or, when lacking adequate sanitation facilities, practising open \ndefecation and urination, limiting their ability to move freely and safely in the public \nsphere, \n \nDeeply concerned that non-existent or inadequate sanitation facilities and \nserious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can negatively \naffect water provision and sustainable access to safe drinking water and that, \naccording to the United Nations World Water Development Report 2021, an estimated \n80 per cent of the world\u2019s wastewater is released into the environment without \ntreatment,  \n \nAffirming the importance of regional and international cooperation, where \nappropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to \n\nA/RES/76/153 \nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation\n \n21-19189\n6/9 \n \nsafe drinking water and sanitation, with the understanding that it has no bearing on \nthe issues of international water law, including international watercourse law,  \n \nExpressing concern that climate change increases the frequency and intensity of \nboth sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have \nadverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights \nto safe drinking water and sanitation, and recalling the need to accelerate action on \nmitigation, enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability \nto climate change, including through resilient water and sanitation systems,  \n \nRecalling the commitment to step up efforts on all fronts to tackle \ndesertification, land degradation, erosion and drought, biodiversity loss and water \nscarcity, which are seen as major environmental, economic and social challenges for \nglobal sustainable development and for the realization of the human rights to safe \ndrinking water and sanitation,  \n \nRecognizing that, while the implications of climate change-related impacts and \nenvironmental damage for the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water \nand sanitation affect individuals and communities around the world, the consequences \nare felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable \nsituations, such as people living in informal settlements, people living in small island \nStates and rural and local communities, and recognizing also that indigenous peoples, \nbecause of their specific situation and nature, may be among the first to face the direct \nconsequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close \nrelationship with the environment and its resources,  \n \n1. \nReaffirms that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as \ncomponents of the right to an adequate standard of living, are essential for the full \nenjoyment of the right to life and all human rights;  \n \n2. \nAlso reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles \neveryone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, \nphysically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the \nhuman right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical \nand affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, \nsocially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while \nreaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of \nliving;  \n \n3. \nWelcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights \nCouncil on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and takes note of \nhis reports; \n \n4. \nReaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full \nrealization of all human rights and to take steps, individually and through \ninternational assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical \ncooperation, to the maximum of their available resources, to progressively achieve \nthe full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate \nmeans, including, in particular, the adoption of legislative measures for the \nimplementation of their human rights obligations; \n \n5. \nCalls upon States:  \n \n(a) \nTo ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking \nwater and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating \ninequalities in access, including for individuals belonging to groups at risk and those \nwho are marginalized on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, \nreligion and national or social origin or on any other grounds;  \n\nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation \nA/RES/76/153\n \n7/9\n21-19189 \n \n \n(b) \nTo prioritize as a matter of urgency the provision of safe drinking water \nand sanitation services that are accessible to all, including persons in vulnerable \nsituations, especially in densely populated, impoverished and rural areas, as a means \nof enhancing pandemic preparedness and preventing the ongoing spread of infectious \ndiseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic;  \n \n(c) \nTo implement the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals \nand targets, 17  including the Goal on

adequate and \nequitable sanitation and hygiene for all women and girls, as well as for menstrual \nhygiene management, including for hygiene facilities and services in public and \nprivate spaces; \n \n(f) \nTo take measures to empower all women and girls for preparedness in \nhumanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural \ndisaster, by ensuring access to water and sanitation services and implementing \ngender-responsive policies, plans and programmes that address, inter alia, effective \nmenstrual health and hygiene management and adequate disposal options for \nmenstrual products, without compromising their rights, safety and dignity; \n \n(g) \nTo address the widespread stigma and shame surrounding menstruation \nand menstrual hygiene by promoting educational and health practices in and out of \nschools in order to foster a culture in which menstruation is recognized as healthy and \nnatural and by ensuring access to factual information thereon, including for men and \nboys, addressing the negative social norms around the issue, as well as ensuring \nuniversal access to hygienic products and gender-sensitive facilities, including \ndisposal and waste management options for menstrual products, while recognizing \nthat women\u2019s and girls\u2019 attendance at school, university or, for women, work can be \naffected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain \npersonal hygiene, such as safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools, \npublic places and, for women, the workplace;  \n \n(h) \nTo promote both women\u2019s leadership and their full, effective and equal \nparticipation in decision-making on water and sanitation management and to ensure \nthat a
