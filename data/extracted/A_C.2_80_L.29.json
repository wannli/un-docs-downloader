\nhealth and nutrition, especially in Africa, in South and West Asia, in the Pacific and \nin parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, and in this regard underlining the urgent \nneed for joint efforts at all levels to respond to the situation in a coherent and effective \nmanner,  \n \nAcknowledging the importance of making agrifood systems more efficient, \ninclusive, resilient and sustainable, including through sustainable farming and \nagriculture, which will contribute to sustainable food production systems and the \nconservation of biodiversity and ecosystems, helping to eradicate hunger and \nmalnutrition in all its forms, calling upon Member States to ensure that areas under \nagriculture, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry are managed sustainably, in particular

nutritious \nfood, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone \nto be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain their physical \nand mental capacities, and underlining the need to make special efforts to meet \nnutritional needs, especially of women, children, particularly in early childhood, older \npersons, Indigenous Peoples, local communities, persons with disabilities, as well as \nof those living in vulnerable situations,  \n \nRecognizing that infant and young child mortality can be reduced through the \nimproved nutritional status of women of reproductive age, especially during \npregnancy, and that exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life is optimal \nfor child survival and nutrition and the promotion of health and cognitive \ndevelopment, as well as an important principle of healthy diets, including through \ncontinued breastfeeding until 2 years of age and beyond combined with appropriate \nnutritious complementary feeding, and highlighting that despite the steady progress \nmade with regard to exclusive breastfeeding, with 48 per cent of infants under \n6 months of age exclusively breastfed worldwide in 2023, immense efforts will be \nrequired to meet the global nutrition targets of the 2030 Agenda and that even this \nindicator requires accelerated progress,  \n \nRemaining deeply concerned that, according to the most recent estimates of the \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for \nAgricultural Development, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the World Food \nProgramme and the World Health Organization, between 638 million and 720 million \npeople may have faced hunger in 2024, corresponding to 7.8 and 8.8 per cent of the \nglobal population, and that among children under 5 years of age, as at 2024, an \nestimated 150.2 million (23.2 per cent) were stunted and 42.8 million (6.6 per cent) \nwere wasted, and that the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity has \nremained unchanged for four consecutive years at the global level, with an estimated \n28.0 per cent of the global population, or 2.3 billion people, moderately or severely \nfood-insecure in 2024, and that global nutrition challenges are increasingly complex \nas multiple forms of malnutrition, including stunting, wasting, underweight, \nmicronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity, may coexist within the same \n\nA/C.2/80/L.29 \n \n25-16858\n8/18 \n \ncountry or household, with about 2.6 billion people in the world unable to afford a \nhealthy diet in 2024,29 \n \nRecalling that the Sustainable Development Goals and targets are integrated and \nindivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development, economic, \nsocial and environmental, and expressing deep concern that, past the midpoint of the \nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda, the world is still far from achieving Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 2, that, at the current pace and scope of implementation, it is \nunlikely to promote the transformational change required and that many parts of the \nworld will not be able to achieve the targets in a timely manner, and calling for \nadditional efforts to support the transformational change needed,  \n \nRecognizing that economic downturns, gender inequalities, conflicts, \nbiodiversity loss, drought and the adverse effects of climate change, including more \nfrequent and extreme weather events, are among the key factors contributing to a \nreversal in the long-term progress in fighting global hunger, making the prospect of \nending hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 more difficult,  \n \nNoting that increasing urbanization, with almost 7 in 10 people projected to live \nin cities by 2050, is driving changes in agrifood systems across the rural-urban \ncontinuum, that these changes represent both challenges and opportunities to ending \nhunger, food insecurity and malnutrition and ensuring that everyone has access to \naffordable healthy diets, and that, globally, food insecurity and malnutrition is higher \nin rural areas than in urban areas, with 32.0 per cent of rural populations experiencing \nfood insecurity and malnutrition in 2024 compared with 23.9 per cent of urban \npopulations,30  \n \nNoting with concern the rise of food and agricultural input prices, including \nfertilizer prices, and the shortages of food and fertilizers caused by supply chain \ndisruptions, affecting crop yields and threatening future agricultural productivity and \nproduction, as well as the continued crisis in supply chains and the disruption to \ntransport and shipping, contributing to a surge in shipping and transport costs, \nparticularly affecting developing countries, \n \nExpressing its concern about the growing number of obese adults in the world, \nwith prevalence at 15.8 per cent in 2022, and that 35.5 million children under 5 years \nof age (5.5 per cent) were overweight in 2024,  \n \nExpressing concern at the findings of the publication entitled 2025 Global \nReport on Food Crises: Joint Analysis for Better Decisions,  \n \nNoting that an increasing number of countries, in particular in Africa, Asia, \nLatin America and the Caribbean and the Pacific, are integrating food security and \nnutrition into their agriculture policies and investment plans and that, as a result, \neradicating hunger, improving food security and ensuring adequate nutrition are being \ngiven greater prominence in regional development strategies, \n \nReiterating the urgent need for action to enhance efforts to build resilience, \nespecially for the most vulnerable, by investing in resilience of agrifood \u2013 systems, \nincluding disaster risk reduction, and to scale up anticipatory approaches, early \nwarning and early action systems, forecasting, prevention-oriented responses and \nemergency preparedness and improve predictive and risk data analytics across \n__________________ \n \n29 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment, United

food security, in particular for women, youth, older \npersons, Indigenous Peoples, local communities and persons with disabilities, as well \nas the other root causes of food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition,  \n \nExpressing concern that climate change disproportionately impacts people in \nvulnerable situations, especially women and children, and their livelihoods, \nultimately putting hundreds of millions of people at risk, and that by 2050, the risk of \nhunger and child malnutrition could increase by up to 20 per cent owing to climate \nchange,  \n \nReiterating the importance of achieving gender equality and the empowerment \nof all women and girls, as well as the recognition and protection of the rights of \nsmallholders, particularly women, reiterating also the importance,
