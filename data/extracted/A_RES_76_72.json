of marine technology, to ensure that all States, especially \ndeveloping countries, in particular the least developed countries, landlocked \ndeveloping countries and small island developing States, as well as coastal African \nStates, are able both to implement the Convention and to benefit from the sustainable \ndevelopment of the oceans and seas, as well as to participate fully in global and \nregional forums and processes dealing with oceans and law of the sea issues, while \nrecognizing the need to also address the particular challenges faced by developing \nmiddle-income countries, \n \nEmphasizing the need to strengthen the ability of competent international \norganizations to contribute, at the global, regional, subregional and bilateral levels, \nthrough cooperation programmes with Governments, to the development of national \ncapacity in marine science and the sustainable management of the oceans and their \nresources, \n \nRecalling that marine science is important for eradicating poverty, contributing \nto food security, conserving the world\u2019s marine environment and resources, helping \nto understand, predict and respond to natural events and promoting the sustainable \ndevelopment of the oceans and seas, by improving knowledge, through sustained \nresearch efforts and the evaluation of monitoring results, and applying such \nknowledge to management and decision-making,  \n \nReiterating its deep concern at the serious adverse impacts on the marine \nenvironment and biodiversity, in particular on vulnerable marine ecosystems and their \nphysical and biogenic structure, including coral reefs, cold water habitats, \nhydrothermal vents and seamounts, of certain human activities,  \n \nEmphasizing the need for the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships, \n \nExpressing deep concern at the adverse economic, social and environmental \nimpacts of the physical alteration and destruction of marine habitats that may result \nfrom land-based and coastal development activities, in particular those land \nreclamation activities that are carried out in a manner that has a detrimental impact \non the marine environment, \n \nReiterating its serious concern at the current and projected adverse effects of \nclimate change and ocean acidification on the marine environment and marine \nbiodiversity, and emphasizing the urgency of addressing these issues,  \n \nNoting with concern, in this regard, the findings by the World Meteorological \nOrganization, in its annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, that, in 2019, carbon dioxide \nlevels in the atmosphere were at 410.5 plus or minus 0.2 parts per million, which \nrepresents an increase of 2.6 parts per million, a relative increase of 0.64 per cent, \nover the period 2018\u20132019, and the findings in its State of the Global Climate 2020 \nthat the global mean temperature for 2020 was about 1.2 degrees Celsius above the \n1850 to 1900 baseline, which places 2020 as one of the three warmest years on record \nglobally, \n \nNoting with concern also that the World Meteorological Organization, in its \nState of the Global Climate 2020, highlighted that the past decade, from 2010 to 2019, \nwas the warmest on record, and that the world also continued to see increasing ocean \nheat content, rising sea levels, reaching its highest value on record in 2020, and \nincreasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, while ocean acidification continued \nto increase and the cryosphere continued its contraction, with global sea ice shrinking, \n \nExpressing concern that climate change continues to increase the severity and \nincidence of coral bleaching throughout tropical seas and weakens the ability of reefs \nto withstand ocean acidification, which could have serious and irreversible negative \n\nOceans and the law of the sea \nA/RES/76/72\n \n5/59\n21-18581 \n \neffects on marine organisms, particularly corals, as well as to withstand other \npressures, including overfishing and pollution,  \n \nReiterating its deep concern at the vulnerability of the environment and the \nfragile ecosystems of the polar regions, including the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic ice \ncap, particularly affected by the observed and projected adverse effects of climate \nchange and ocean acidification, \n \nRecognizing the need for a more integrated and ecosystem-based approach to, \nfurther study of and the promotion of measures for enhanced cooperation, coordination \nand collaboration relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological \ndiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction,  \n \nRecognizing also that the realization of the benefits of the Convention could be \nenhanced by international cooperation, technical assistance and advanced scientific \nknowledge, as well as by funding and capacity-building,  \n \nRecognizing further that hydrographic surveys and nautical charting are critical \nto the safety of navigation and life at sea, environmental protection, including the \nprotection of vulnerable marine ecosystems, and the economics of the global shipping \nindustry, and encouraging further efforts towards electronic charting, which not only \nprovides significantly increased benefits for safe navigation and management of ship \nmovement, but also provides data and information that can be used for sustainable \nfisheries activities and other sectoral uses of the marine environment, the delimitation \nof maritime boundaries and environmental protection, and noting that, under the \nInternational Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974,17 ships on international \nvoyages are required to carry an electronic chart display and information system, in \naccordance with the implementation schedule as set out in that Convention,  \n \nRecognizing that ocean data buoys deployed and operated in accordance with \ninternational law are critical for improving understanding of weather, climate and \necosystems, and that certain types of ocean data buoys contribute to saving lives by \ndetecting tsunamis, and reiterating its serious concern at intentional and unintentional \ndamage to such buoys,  \n \nEmphasizing that underwater archaeological, cultural and historical heritage, \nincluding shipwrecks and watercraft, holds essential information on the history of \nhumankind and that such heritage is a resource that needs to be protected and \npreserved,  \n \nRecognizing the duty of States under article 303, paragraph 1, of the Convention \nto protect objects of an archaeological and historical nature found at sea and to \ncooperate for this purpose, \n \nExpressing concern, in this regard, at various threats posed to such objects, \nincluding their destruction as well as the illicit trafficking in such objects, \n \nRecognizing that illicit trafficking in wildlife is, in some cases, committed by \ntransnational organized criminal groups using maritime routes, contributes to \nbiodiversity loss and damage to ecosystems and livelihoods and requires enhanced \nregional and global cooperation and coordination in response, in accordance with \ninternational law, \n \nNoting with concern the continuing problem of transnational organized crime \ncommitted at sea, including illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, \nthe smuggling of migrants, trafficking in persons and illicit trafficking in firearms, and \nthreats to maritime safety and security, including piracy, armed robbery at sea, \nsmuggling and terrorist acts against shipping, offshore installations and other maritime \n__________________ \n \n17  United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1184, No. 18961. \n\nA/RES/76/72 \nOceans and the law of the sea\n

\nReiterating the importance of the fair treatment of crew members and its \ninfluence on maritime safety, \n \nRecognizing that fibre-optic submarine cables transmit most of the world\u2019s data \nand communications and hence are vitally important to the global economy and the \nnational security of all States, conscious that these cables are susceptible to \nintentional and accidental damage from shipping and other activities and that the \nmaintenance, including the repair, of these cables is important, noting that these \nmatters have been brought to the attention of States at various workshops and \nseminars, and conscious of the need for States to adopt national laws and regulations \nto protect submarine cables and render their wilful damage or damage by culpable \nnegligence punishable offences,  \n \nNoting the importance of the delineation of the outer limits of the continental \nshelf beyond 200 nautical miles and that it is in the broader interest of the \ninternational community that coastal States with a continental shelf beyond 200 \nnautical miles submit information on the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond \n200 nautical miles to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (the \nCommission), and welcoming the submissions to the Commission by a considerable \nnumber of States Parties to the Convention on the outer limits of their continental \nshelf beyond 200 nautical miles, that the Commission has continued to fulfil its role, \nincluding of making recommendations to coastal States, and that the summaries of \nrecommendations are being made publicly available,18 \n \nNoting also that some coastal States may continue to face particular challenges \nin relation to preparing and presenting submissions to the Commission,  \n \nNoting further that financial and technical assistance may be sought by \ndeveloping countries for activities in relation to preparing and presenting submissions \nto the Commission, including additional information with respect to submissions and \nrevised or new submissions, including through the voluntary trust fund established by \nthe General Assembly in its resolution 55/7 of 30 October 200019 for the purpose of \nfacilitating the preparation of submissions to the Commission for developing States, \nin particular the least developed countries and small island developing States, and \ncompliance with article 76 of the Convention, as well as other accessible international \nassistance, \n \nReaffirming the importance of the work of the Commission for coastal States \nand for the international community,  \n \nRecognizing that practical difficulties can arise when there is a considerable \ndelay between the preparation of submissions and their consideration by the \nCommission, including in retaining expertise up to and during the consideration of \nthe submissions by the Commission,  \n \nRecognizing also the significant workload of the Commission in view of the \nlarge number of submissions already received and a number of submissions yet to be \nreceived, which places significant demands and challenges on its members and the \nsecretariat as provided
