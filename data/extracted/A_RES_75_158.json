trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced \nmarriage, forced labour and other forms of exploitation,  \n \nRecognizing that pervasive gender inequality, poverty, unemployment, lack of \nsocioeconomic opportunities, gender-based violence, discrimination, including multiple \nand intersecting forms of discrimination, marginalization and persistent demand are \namong the underlying causes that make women and girls vulnerable to human trafficking, \n \nRecognizing also the need to adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures, \nsuch as educational, social or cultural measures, including through bilateral and \nmultilateral cooperation, to discourage the demand, which fosters all forms of \nexploitation of persons, especially women and children, that leads to human trafficking,  \n \nRecognizing further the role that men and boys can play as agents of change in \naddressing the harmful impact of gender stereotypes and negative social norms and \nin preventing violence against women and human trafficking, and underlining the \nneed to educate and engage men and boys for this purpose, \n \nRecognizing the heightened vulnerability to trafficking of women and girls in \nhumanitarian crisis situations, including in conflict and post-conflict environments, \nnatural disasters, pandemic situations, including the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic, and

Agenda for the Protection of Cross-Border \nDisplaced Persons in the Context of Disasters and Climate Change, resulting from the \nNansen Initiative, while recognizing that not all States are participating in them,  \n \nRecognizing also that in armed conflict, human trafficking for the purpose of \nsexual exploitation, forced marriage and labour exploitation can be prevalent, and \nexpressing deep concern over its negative impacts on victims of human trafficking,  \n \nRecognizing further the need to reinforce efforts regarding the provision of \nrelevant documents, such as birth registration documents, in order to lower the risk \nof women and girls of being subjected to human trafficking and to help to identify \nvictims of human trafficking, \n \nRecognizing that, despite the progress made, challenges to preventing and \ncombating trafficking in women and girls and to protecting and assisting the victims \nof human trafficking remain and that further efforts should be made to adopt and \nimplement adequate legislation and other measures and to continue improving the \ncollection of reliable data disaggregated by sex, age, nationality, disability, \ngeographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts and other \nrelevant factors and of statistics that would allow proper analysis of the nature, extent \nand risk factors of trafficking in women and girls,  \n \nRecognizing also that further work is required both to better understand the link \nbetween migration and human trafficking and to develop more effective

and inhuman conditions and in \nflagrant violation of national laws and international standards,  \n \nNoting with concern that women and girls are also vulnerable to the risk of \nhuman trafficking for the purpose of organ removal, and in this regard taking note of \nCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice resolution 25/1 of 27 May \n2016, entitled \u201cPreventing and combating trafficking in human organs and trafficking \nin persons for the purpose of organ removal\u201d, adopted by the Commission at its \ntwenty-fifth session,15  \n \nRecognizing that victims of human trafficking are particularly exposed to \nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and \ngirl victims are often subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and \nviolence, including on the grounds of their gender, age, ethnicity, disability, culture \nand religion, as well as their origin, and that those forms of discrimination themselves \nmay fuel human trafficking,  \n \nNoting with concern that some of the demand fostering sexual exploitation, \nlabour exploitation and the illegal removal of organs is met by human trafficking, and \nrecognizing that human trafficking is fuelled by high profits for traffickers and \ndemand that fosters all forms of exploitation, \n \nAcknowledging that women and girl victims of human trafficking, owing to \npervasive and persistent gender inequality, are further disadvantaged and \nmarginalized by a general lack of information on or awareness and recognition of \ntheir human rights and by the stigmatization often associated with human trafficking, \nas well as by the obstacles they meet in gaining access to accurate information and \nrecourse mechanisms in cases of the violations and abuses of their rights, and that \nspecial measures are required for their protection and to increase their awareness,  \n \nTaking note of the Doha Declaration on Integrating Crime Prevention and \nCriminal Justice into the Wider United Nations Agenda to Address Social and \nEconomic Challenges and to Promote the Rule of Law at the National and International \nLevels, and Public Participation, adopted in April 2015,16 which expresses the \nimportance of implementing a victim-oriented approach to prevent and counter all \nforms of human trafficking for the purpose of

removal of organs, \nwhere appropriate, in accordance with the provisions of the Protocol to Prevent, \nSuppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children,  \n \nReaffirming the
