achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, 6 \n \nCommending the persistent efforts of victims and survivors, civil society \norganizations, including non\u2011governmental organizations, as well as national human \nrights institutions and national preventive mechanisms, and the considerable network \nof centres for the rehabilitation of victims and survivors of torture, to prevent and \ncombat torture, to alleviate the suffering of victims and survivors of torture and to \nfoster their integration, \n \nDeeply concerned that acts which can amount to torture and other cruel, \ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including when committed against \npersons exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association and \nfreedom of expression, persist in all regions of the world in both peacetime and armed \nconflicts, \n \n1. \nCondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading \ntreatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain \nprohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, \nand calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non\u2011derogable \nprohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; \n \n2. \nAlso condemns any action or attempt by States or public officials to \nlegalize, instigate, authorize, consent to or acquiesce in torture and other cruel, \ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under any circumstances, including \non grounds of national security and counter-terrorism or through

commit or conceal acts amounting to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading \ntreatment or punishment nor allow pleas of respondeat superior as a criminal defence \nin cases in which such orders were obeyed; \n \n4. \nEmphasizes that acts of torture or inhuman treatment are grave breaches \nof the Geneva Conventions of 1949, that acts of torture and cruel treatment in armed \nconflict are serious violations of international humanitarian law and in this regard \nconstitute war crimes, that acts of torture can constitute crimes against humanity and \nthat the perpetrators of all acts of torture must be prosecuted and punished, and in this \nregard notes the efforts of the International Criminal Court to end impunity by seeking \nto ensure accountability and punishment of perpetrators

effective legislative, administrative, judicial and \nother measures are taken to prevent and respond to such acts, and calls upon all States \nto ensure respect for the prohibitions of sexual

evidence in any \nproceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement \nor evidence was obtained, urges States to extend that prohibition to statements or \nevidence obtained as a result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, \nand recognizes that adequate corroboration of statements, including confessions, used \nas evidence in any proceedings constitutes one safeguard for the prevention of torture \nand other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; \n \n8. \nUrges States not to expel, return (\u201crefouler\u201d), extradite or in any other way \ntransfer a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing \nthat the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, stresses the \nimportance of effective legal and procedural safeguards in this regard, and recognizes \nthat diplomatic assurances, where given, do not release States from their obligations \nunder international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law, in particular the \nprinciple of non\u2011refoulement; \n \n9. \nRecalls that, for the purpose of determining whether there are substantial \ngrounds for believing that a

concerned of a consistent \npattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights; \n \n10.

Also calls upon all States to take effective measures to ensure that the use \nof force by police and other law enforcement officials, including the use of less-lethal \nweapons, is in conformity with international obligations and the principles of legality, \nnecessity, proportionality, accountability and non\u2011discrimination, and that those using \nforce account for each use of force, bearing in mind that lethal force may only be used \nas a last resort to protect against an imminent threat to life or grievous bodily harm, \nand recalls in this regard Human Rights Council resolution 46/15 of 23 March 2021;7 \n \n13. Recalls its resolution 43/173 of 9 December 1988 on the Body of Principles \nfor the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, and in \n_______________ \n \n7 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-sixth Session, Supplement No. 53 \n(A/76/53), chap.

Reminds all States that prolonged incommunicado detention or detention \nin secret places can facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such \ntreatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, \nsecurity and dignity of the person and to ensure that prolonged incommunicado \ndetention and secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished; \n \n20.

Recalls that the unlawful or excessive use of force by law enforcement \nofficials committed against persons exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful \nassembly may constitute torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or \npunishment, and notes in this regard the Model Protocol for Law Enforcement \nOfficials to Promote and Protect Human Rights in the Context of Peaceful Protests; \n \n22. Welcomes the establishment of national preventive mechanisms to prevent \ntorture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, urges States \nto consider establishing, appointing, maintaining or enhancing independent and \neffective mechanisms that have experts with the required capabilities and professional \nknowledge to undertake monitoring visits to places of detention and other places \nunder State jurisdiction and control where persons are or may be deprived of their \nliberty, inter alia, with a view to preventing acts of torture or other cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading treatment or punishment, and calls upon States Parties to the Optional \nProtocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \nTreatment or Punishment12 to fulfil their obligation to designate or establish national \npreventive mechanisms at the latest one year after the entry into force of the Protocol \nor of its ratification or accession, that are truly independent, composed of experts with \nthe required capabilities and professional knowledge, and properly resourced and, \nfurther, to consider the recommendations of such mechanisms, to encourage public \ndebate and to engage in constructive dialogue with such mechanisms on possible \nimplementation measures; \n \n23. Calls upon all States to take appropriate effective legislative, \nadministrative, judicial and other measures to prevent and prohibit the production, \ntrade, export, import and use of equipment and technology that have no practical use \nother than for the purpose of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment \nor punishment, and in this regard takes note of the report of the Group of \nGovernmental Experts pursuant to resolution 73/304 of 28 June 2019; \n \n24.
