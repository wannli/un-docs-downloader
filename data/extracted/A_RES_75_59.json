2017 and 73/67 of 5 December 2018, \n \nExpressing grave concern over the devastation caused by the increasing use of \nimprovised explosive devices by illegal armed groups, terrorists and other \nunauthorized recipients,1 which has affected a large number of countries and has \nresulted in thousands of casualties, both civilian and military, and in this regard \nstressing the need for all actors to comply with applicable international law at all \ntimes, \n \nExpressing concern over the increased use of and sophistication of the design \nand means of detonation of improvised explosive devices, \n \nExpressing profound concern at the indiscriminate use and effects of improvised \nexplosive devices and at the increasing humanitarian impact of such attacks on \ncivilian populations worldwide, in particular through the perpetration of terrorist acts, \nand noting the need for a comprehensive approach in addressing this concern, \n \nExpressing concern at the serious harm that such improvised explosive device \nattacks have caused to United Nations staff and peacekeepers, and to humanitarian \nworkers, by threatening their lives, increasing the cost of their activities, limiting their \nfreedom of movement and affecting their ability to effectively deliver on their \nmandates, \n \nExpressing concern also about the negative impact of these attacks on \nsocioeconomic

the threat posed by improvised \nexplosive devices, \n \nUnderlining the importance of addressing the threat of improvised explosive \ndevices and their differential impacts on women, girls, boys and men, \n \nRecognizing that the wide spectrum of materials that can be used for the \nmanufacture of improvised explosive devices, including those sourced from the \nmilitary and civilian industry, contributes to their diverse nature and their deployment \nmethods, which thus requires an appropriate approach to the formulation of measures \nto counter them, \n \nNoting that the impact of improvised explosive devices spans a wide array of \npolicy areas and that, owing to the extent of the cross-cutting nature of the issue, a \nwhole-of-government approach focusing on the capacity of Governments to \neffectively bring together several policy strands for comprehensive action is essential, \n \nUnderlining the important role that States can play in raising awareness among \nprivate sector and other entities about the possible theft, diversion and misuse of their \nproducts to make improvised explosive devices, with a view to enabling those entities \nto develop effective strategies to counter the threat of improvised explosive devices, 3 \nincluding to prevent the adverse impact of the diversion of materials and the potential \nloss of revenue and risk to reputation, either in a partnership with governmental \nauthorities, or through business-to-business processes or activities, \n \nNoting existing industry-led initiatives that seek to increase industry oversight \nand accountability along the supply chain for precursor components, and encouraging \nStates to engage, as appropriate, with private sector industry actors in supporting such \ninitiatives, \n \nNoting also the contribution of good governance, the promotion of human \nrights, the rule of law, adherence to the principles of the Charter and sustained and \ninclusive socioeconomic growth, including through effective measures and \nmechanisms for persons belonging to vulnerable groups, as important elements in \ncomprehensively addressing the issue of improvised explosive devices, in

them in, \nobtaining, handling, financing, storing, using or seeking access to all types of \nexplosives, whether military or civilian, as well as other military or civilian materials \nand components that can be used to manufacture improvised explosive devices, \nincluding detonators, detonating cords and chemical components, while at the same \ntime avoiding any undue restrictions on the legitimate use of those materials, \n__________________ \n \n2 Resolution 70/1. \n \n3 See the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations \n\u201cProtect, Respect
