Rohingya Muslims, \n \nExpressing deep concern at the indiscriminate use of violence and ongoing \nescalation and expansion of the conflict, as well as the declaration, maintenance and \nextension of martial law in parts of the country, which seriously undermines the \nenjoyment of human rights in Myanmar, especially those of women, children, older \npersons and persons with disabilities, as well as those of persons belonging to ethnic \nand religious minorities, including Rohingya Muslims, owing to the heavy \nmilitarization of Myanmar aggravated by the continued access to arms from abroad \nthat increases the ability of the Myanmar military to commit serious violations of \ninternational human rights law and international humanitarian law, including attacks \nagainst civilians and civilian objects and seriously undermines the enjoyment of \nhuman rights, especially by Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, \n \nExpressing grave concern at the continuing use of Rohingya Muslims as human \nshields and the forcible conscription of Rohingya Muslims, which are escalating \nintercommunal tensions between Rakhine communities and Rohingya Muslims, and \nat reports of the

military and other armed actors, \nincluding the Arakan Army, in sustaining cycles of violence in Rakhine State, \nincluding through targeted attacks against Rohingya Muslims, obstruction of \nhumanitarian access and actions that exacerbate ethnic tensions, \n \nNoting with concern that, due to the escalation in fighting between the Myanmar \nmilitary and the Arakan Army and the continuing human rights violations and abuses \nagainst Rohingya Muslims, humanitarian access remains severely restricted for the \ninternational community in northern Rakhine State, which has caused United Nations \nagencies and international partners to relocate elsewhere in Myanmar, \n \nExpressing deep concern at the most recent reports of grave human rights \nviolations and abuses against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State by the Myanmar \nmilitary and other armed actors, including the Arakan Army, including the widespread \nburning of villages, the forced displacement of over 200,000 individuals and the \ndeliberate targeting of civilians, forced conscription and arbitrary detention, which \nhave led to heightened insecurity and intercommunal tension, and condemning \nstrongly the escalating violence in Maungdaw and other areas, which continues to \nseverely worsen the already fragile humanitarian conditions in Rakhine State, \n \nExpressing deep concern also at the continuing reports of forced displacement \ntaking place due to the ongoing conflict in Rakhine State, compelling over 150,000 \nRohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh and many thousands to other countries of

fleeing by sea from the violence and persecution in Rakhine State, according to \nreports by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, recalling that nearly \n1 in 5 Rohingya Muslims who have attempted sea crossings in 2025 have died or gone \nmissing, and emphasizing that these maritime tragedies highlight both the desperation \nof the Rohingya people and the failure of the international community to provide \nadequate protection and address the root causes of displacement, \n \nExpressing grave concern at the forcible conscription by the Myanmar military \nof men aged 18 to 35 years and women aged 18 to 27 years, including Rohingya \nMuslims, which has had severe consequences for the civilian population, especially \n\nA/RES/80/221 \nSituation of human rights of Rohingya Muslims

of trafficking, exploitation and \nabuse, and could result in increased instability in Myanmar and across the region and \nan increase in the numbers of internally displaced persons and of refugees, including \nRohingya Muslims and other minorities, in neighbouring countries and Rohingya-\nhosting countries, \n \nAlarmed at the hardening of conflict in Rakhine State and at the continued \nreports of increased hatred, hate speech and violence against Rohingya Muslims, the \nburning of Rohingya villages, including in Buthidaung and Maungdaw, and the \ndestruction of Rohingya homes and livelihoods, leading to the reported killing, \nwounding and forced internal displacement of Rohingya Muslims and other \nminorities, which have aggravated the already precarious human rights and \nhumanitarian situation in Rakhine State and pose serious challenges for creating a \nconducive environment for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of \nRohingya Muslims, and expressing grave concern that prolonged uncertainty over the \nrepatriation has been leading Rohingya Muslims temporarily sheltered in Bangladesh \nto despair, and may be having spillover effects on regional peace and stability, \n \nCondemning in the strongest terms the arbitrary detention, politically motivated \narrests and convictions, sentencing and executions, including of opposition activists, \nas well as violent acts including extrajudicial killings, sexual and gender-based \nviolence, and torture committed against the population, including medical personnel, \nteachers, students, lawyers, artists, journalists and other media workers, trade union \nmembers, humanitarian workers and many others, which exacerbates the polarization \nand violence and worsens the humanitarian situation in the country, \n \nUnderlining the urgency for the Myanmar military to immediately end all acts \nof violence, to unconditionally and immediately release all those arbitrarily detained \nand to refrain from further violence and arbitrary detentions, and to abide by \ninternational law, including international human rights law and international \nhumanitarian law, \n \nExpressing its unequivocal support for the people of Myanmar, including \nRohingya Muslims and other minorities, and their democratic will, interests and \naspirations for peace, as well as for the

its final report28 and all its other reports, including the reports \non the economic interests of the Myanmar military and on sexual and gender-based \nviolence in Myanmar and the gendered impact of its ethnic conflicts, alarmed by its \nfindings of evidence of the most serious human rights violations and abuses suffered \nby Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, and deeply regretting the lack of \ncooperation of Myanmar with the fact-finding mission, \n \nConcerned that, contrary to the recommendations of the fact-finding mission, \nwhich ended its mandate in September 2019, laws, orders,

Muslims in Myanmar, and calling upon Myanmar to fully comply with the \norder, \n \nRecalling further the judgment of the International Court of Justice of 22 July \n2022 rejecting the preliminary

concern that, in Rakhine State, the remaining Rohingya \nMuslims continue to be largely segregated and discriminated against with respect to \naccessing citizenship and enjoying their human rights and

and education, as well as livelihoods, \n \nExpressing its concern that Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, in \nparticular women and girls, remain at significant risk of sexual and gender-based

Myanmar military, \nto abide by international law, including international humanitarian law, in this matter, \nand to enable humanitarian actors to deliver humanitarian aid consistent with the \nhumanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence, \n \nExpressing deep sympathy to all the victims and survivors of the earthquakes of \nMarch 2025, which resulted in

dramatic rise in hunger and malnutrition \nin Rakhine State, driven by prolonged conflict, severe movement restrictions, soaring \nfood prices and the reduction of support due to a significant decrease in humanitarian \nfunding, and that the lack of sufficient humanitarian access, especially to food, in \nparticular to areas with internally displaced persons and to the areas from which many \npeople have been and continue to be forcibly displaced and in which many others, \nsuch as Rohingya Muslims, are living in precarious conditions, is exacerbating the \nhumanitarian crisis, which may lead to hunger-induced displacement and more influx \nto Bangladesh, \n \nExpressing deep concern at the severe deterioration of humanitarian access \nthroughout Myanmar, particularly in conflict-affected regions, due to systematic \nrestrictions imposed by the Myanmar military, ongoing armed conflict and increasing \ninterference in aid distribution by the Myanmar military and by other armed actors, \nwhich have collectively left many displaced and vulnerable populations, including \nRohingya Muslims and ethnic minorities, without adequate food, healthcare and \nprotection, \n \nCondemning the deliberate obstruction of humanitarian assistance, including the \narrest, detention and killing of humanitarian workers, the occupation of aid \ninfrastructure as well as the

\nGovernment of Bangladesh, in cooperation with United Nations agencies and the \ninternational community, including all humanitarian actors, has extended to those \nfleeing human rights violations

of the \nUnited Nations, to provide humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya Muslims \nrelocated to Bhashan Char, and recognizing the extensive investments that the \nGovernment of Bangladesh has made in its Bhashan Char project, including in the \nfacilities and infrastructure, and welcoming further efforts to facilitate access to work \nand livelihood opportunities while noting the importance of efforts to ensure the \nsustainability of the project, \n \nExpressing grave concern at the persistent decline in international humanitarian \nassistance and recent reductions in funding for Rohingya Muslims temporarily \nsheltered in Bangladesh, including the reduction in food aid, the suspension of youth \neducation programmes and the continued underfunding of healthcare services, which \nhave disproportionately affected women, children and persons with disabilities, and \nreiterating in this regard its grave concern that, despite the unprecedented generosity \nof host countries and donors, the gap between humanitarian needs on the ground and \navailability of funding continues to grow, in both Rakhine State and in refugee camps \nin Bangladesh, and noting with alarm that, as of October 2025, less than 40 per cent \nof the joint response plan for the Rohingya humanitarian crisis has been funded, \nrecalling in this context the need for more equitable burden- and responsibility-\nsharing, and encouraging in this regard Member States and other actors to leverage \nthe follow-up process of the second Global Refugee Forum, held in 2023, to \ndemonstrate commitment to easing the pressure on the host countries and work \ntowards sustainable solutions, \n \nExpressing alarm at the rapidly increasing use of anti\u2011personnel landmines and \nunexploded ordnance and their disproportionate impact on children, and also \nexpressing alarm over reports of the criminalization of amputees, as well as the \nsystematic denial of access by victims and survivors to life-saving aid, including \nmedical care and prosthetics, recognizing that these actions are contrary to \ninternational law, including article 11 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities,31 \n \nUnderlining the urgent need to prevent the laying of additional landmines and \nto promote the marking and mapping of newly mined areas, mine clearance, the \nclearance of explosive remnants of war and mine-risk education programmes for \ncivilians, and to prioritize victim assistance and stockpile destruction, including prior \nto any movement by
