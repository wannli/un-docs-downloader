or  \n \n(b) \nThe State in which the parties to the settlement agreement have their places \nof business is different from either:  \n \n(i) \nThe State in which a substantial part of the obligations under the settlement \nagreement is performed;

 \n \n(b) \nIf a party does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to the \nparty\u2019s habitual residence. \n2. \nA settlement agreement is \u201cin writing\u201d if its content is recorded in any form. \nThe requirement that a settlement agreement be in writing is met by an electronic \n\nA/RES/73/198 \nUnited Nations Convention on International Settlement\nAgreements Resulting from Mediation\n \n18-22460\n4/9 \n \ncommunication if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be useable \nfor subsequent reference. \n3. \n\u201cMediation\u201d means a process, irrespective of the expression used or the basis \nupon which the process is carried out, whereby parties attempt to reach an amicable \nsettlement of their dispute with the assistance of a third person or persons (\u201cthe \nmediator\u201d) lacking the authority to impose a solution upon the parties to the dispute. \n \nArticle 3 \nGeneral principles \n \n1. \nEach Party to the Convention shall enforce a settlement agreement in \naccordance with its rules of procedure and under the conditions laid down in this \nConvention. \n2. \nIf a dispute arises concerning a matter that a party claims was already resolved \nby a settlement agreement, a Party to the Convention shall allow the party to invoke \nthe settlement agreement in accordance with its rules of procedure and under the \nconditions laid down in this Convention, in order to prove that the matter has already \nbeen resolved. \n \nArticle 4 \nRequirements for reliance on settlement agreements \n \n1. \nA party relying on a settlement agreement under this Convention shall supply to \nthe competent authority of the Party to the Convention where relief is sought: \n \n(a) \nThe settlement agreement signed by the parties;
