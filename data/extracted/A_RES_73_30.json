an arms race in outer space\n \n18-21223\n2/3 \n \n \nRecognizing that the prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a \ngrave danger for international peace and security, \n \nEmphasizing the paramount importance of strict compliance with existing arms \nlimitation and disarmament agreements relevant to outer space, including bilateral \nagreements, and with the existing legal regime concerning the use of outer space, \n \nConsidering that wide participation in the legal regime applicable to outer space \ncould contribute to enhancing its effectiveness, \n \nNoting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer \nSpace, taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and \nseeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms, continued the examination and \nidentification of various issues, existing agreements and existing proposals, as well \nas future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space, and that \nthis contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer \nperception of the various positions, \n \nNoting also that there were no objections in principle in the Conference on \nDisarmament to the re-establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee, subject to \nre-examination of the mandate contained in the decision of the Conference on \nDisarmament of 13 February

from those efforts as soon as possible, \n \nConvinced that further measures should be examined in the search for effective \nand verifiable bilateral and multilateral agreements in order to prevent an arms race \nin outer space, including the weaponization of outer space, \n \nStressing that the growing use of outer space increases the need for greater \ntransparency and better information on the part of the international community, \n \nRecalling, in this context, its previous resolutions, in particular resolutions \n45/55 B of 4 December 1990, 47/51 of 9 December 1992 and 48/74 A of 16 December \n1993, in which, inter alia, it reaffirmed the importance of confidence-building \nmeasures as a means conducive to ensuring the attainment of the objective of the \nprevention of an arms race in outer space, \n \nConscious of the benefits of confidence- and security-building measures in the \nmilitary field, \n \nRecognizing that negotiations for the conclusion of an international agreement \nor agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space remain a priority task of the \nConference on Disarmament and that the concrete proposals on confidence-building \nmeasures could form an integral part of such agreements, \n \nNoting with satisfaction the constructive, structured and focused debate on the \nprevention of an arms race in outer space at the Conference on Disarmament each \nyear from 2009 to 2018, \n \nNoting the introduction by China and the Russian Federation at the Conference \non Disarmament of the draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in \nouter space and of the threat or use of force against outer space objects in 2008 and \nthe submission of its updated version in 2014,4  \n__________________ \n \n3  See Official Records of the

Arms Race in Outer Space, that the legal regime applicable \nto outer space by itself does not guarantee the prevention of an arms race in outer \nspace, that the regime plays a significant role in
