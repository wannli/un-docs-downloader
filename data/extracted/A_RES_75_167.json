should be addressed in \npolicies and programmes on child, early and forced marriage and that the gathering \nof information on these arrangements will help to develop responses for affected girls \nand women, \n \nNoting with concern that deep-rooted gender inequalities and stereotypes, \nharmful practices, perceptions and customs, and discriminatory norms are not only \nobstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights and the empowerment of all women \nand girls, but are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, and \nthat the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places children, in particular \nthe girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of \ndiscrimination and violence throughout their lives, \n \nNoting with concern also that poverty, insecurity, early pregnancy and lack of \neducation are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, that \narmed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and \nthat child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the \npoorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual \neradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international \ncommunity, \n \nRecognizing that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and \nunderreported and often coincides with impunity and lack of accountability, \nparticularly at the community level, and that the persistence of child, early and forced \nmarriage places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering \nvarious forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including marital \nrape and sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status \nof girls and adolescent girls in society, \n \nRecognizing also that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to \nthe achievement of the economic empowerment of women and their social and \neconomic development, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance \nand remain in the labour market, and that this harmful practice can impede economic \nindependence and impose direct and indirect short- and long-term costs on society, \nand recognizing further that the economic autonomy of women can expand their \noptions for leaving abusive relationships, \n \nRecognizing further that child, early and forced marriage undermines women\u2019s \nand girls\u2019 autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives and that the \nempowerment of and investment in all women and girls, as well as the strengthening \nof their voice, agency, leadership and meaningful participation in all decisions that \naffect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and \ndiscrimination, violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable \ndevelopment, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, \n \nBearing in mind the vital importance of birth registration for the realization of \nthe human rights of individuals, especially girls, \n \nRecognizing that men and boys should play a role as strategic partners and allies \nof women and girls and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to \ntransforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence, as \nwell as child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender \nequality and the empowerment of women and girls, \n \nRecognizing also that families, communities and religious, traditional and \ncommunity leaders play an essential role in transforming negative social norms and \nconfronting gender inequality, and recognizing further that empowering girls, \nincluding already married girls, requires their active participation in decision-making \nprocesses and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including \n\nA/RES/75/167 \nChild, early and forced marriage\n \n20-17337\n4/11 \n \nthrough women\u2019s and girls\u2019 organizations, with the active support and engagement of \ntheir parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as \nthe wider community, \n \nRecognizing further the need to support girls and women who were subjected to \nchild, early and forced marriage, as well as their children, and underscoring the \nimportance of removing structural barriers that prevent their access to services that \nrespond to their specific needs, \n \nNoting with concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects \ngirls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle \nto educational opportunities and the development of employable skills for girls and \nyoung women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to \npregnancy, marriage, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and that educational \npossibilities and opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and \ngirls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in \neconomic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making,  \n \nNoting with concern also that, despite gains in providing access to education, \ngirls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary \neducation, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by \nnegative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal \nhygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs \nof girls, \n \nRecognizing that child, early and forced marriage remains a serious threat to \nmultiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, \nincluding but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly \nincreasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and \nnewborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, \nincluding HIV and AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, \n \nRecognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage \ncan increase during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced displacement, \narmed conflict, public health emergencies and natural disasters because of various \nfactors, including insecurity, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, the \nmisconception of providing protection through marriage, gender inequality, lack of \naccess to continuous, quality education, the stigmatization of pregnancy outside \nmarriage, the absence of family planning services, disruption in social networks and \nroutines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, and that this \nrequires increased attention, appropriate protection measures and coordinated action \nby relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and \ngirls affected, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing \nfurther the importance of addressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls \nto sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation in those situations, \n \nRecognizing further that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage \nand supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require \nappropriate gender- and age-sensitive protection, prevention and response measures, \nas well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, and that existing gaps in the \ncollection and use of reliable data and evidence remain a major challenge for \nprogramming and informing appropriate measures and actions, \n \nExpressing deep concern about the unprecedented and multifaceted negative \nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of, and efforts to end, child, \nearly and forced marriage, including the wide-reaching economic, social and human \nconsequences and devastating impacts of the pandemic on the livelihoods of people \nand families, especially women and girls, and the poorest and most vulnerable, as \n\nChild, early and forced marriage \nA/RES/75/167\n \n5/11\n20-17337 \n \nwell as the severe disruption to health and education systems, social protection \nprogrammes and the provision of protection and support services, including essential \nservices, \n \nNoting with deep concern that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and \nassociated containment measures, including school closures and restrictions on the \nright to freedom of movement, are likely to increase risks faced by girls, including \nalready married girls, as well as women affected by this harmful practice, including \nrisks associated with sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking in persons and \nother types of exploitation, social isolation, unintended and/or early pregnancy, \nobstetric fistula, female genital mutilation, economic hardship, as well as the \ndisproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and the associated risk of \nnot returning to school, and difficulties in gaining access to health-care services, \nhindering the fulfilment of their rights and future economic opportunities, and that \nthese risks are even further exacerbated in humanitarian situations, \n \nExpressing deep concern that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic not only \nexacerbates root causes of child, early and forced marriage, but also diverts \ninternational, regional and national attention and resources away from, inter alia, the \nprevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage and other harmful \npractices, and furthermore that COVID-19 containment measures are delaying and \ndisrupting efforts, including by civil society and other relevant stakeholders, to end \nchild, early and forced marriage, especially at the local level, \n \n1. \nTakes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General;13  \n \n2. \nCalls upon States, with the participation of relevant stakeholders, \nincluding women and girls, men and boys, parents and other family members, \nteachers, religious, traditional and community leaders, civil society, organizations led \nby girls, women\u2019s organizations, youth and human rights groups, the media and the \nprivate sector, to develop and implement holistic, comprehensive and coordinated \nresponses and strategies to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, to \nsupport girls and women who are affected or at risk, who have fled such a marriage \nor whose marriage has dissolved, and widowed girls or women who were married as \ngirls, including through the strengthening of child protection systems, protection \nmechanisms such as safe shelters, access to justice and the sharing of best practices \nacross borders; \n \n3. \nAlso calls upon States to develop and implement measures at all levels to \nend child, early and forced marriage, including national and subnational action plans \nwhere appropriate, and to make adequate resources available across relevant sectors, \nincluding health, nutrition, protection, governance and education; \n \n4. \nUrges States to enact, enforce and uphold laws and policies aimed at \npreventing and ending child, early and forced marriage, protecting those at risk and \naddressing the needs of those affected, and work towards the coherence of these laws \nand policies at the local level, to ensure that marriage is entered into only with the \ninformed, free and full consent of the intending spouses; \n \n5. \nCalls upon States to enact, enforce and uphold laws concerning a \nminimum age of marriage, to monitor their application and to progressively amend \nlaws with lower minimum ages of marriage and/or ages of majority to 18 and engage \nall relevant authorities to ensure that these laws are

empowered, to express themselves, to participate meaningfully in all \ndecisions that affect them and to become agents of change within their communities; \n \n9. \nFurther calls upon States to promote awareness-raising about the harmful \neffects of child, early and forced marriage on the individual and wider society and the \nbenefits of ending this harmful practice, including through open dialogue with all \nstakeholders, including girls and boys, women and men, religious, traditional and \ncommunity leaders, parents, legal guardians and other family members, to work with \nlocal communities to combat negative social norms and gender stereotypes that \ncondone child, early and forced marriage, to empower parents and communities to \nabandon the practice and to empower all women and girls to make informed decisions \nabout their lives; \n \n10. Recognizes that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his \nor her personality, should grow up in a family environment and in an atmosphere of \nhappiness, love and understanding and that parents or, as the case may be, legal \nguardians have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the \nchild, acknowledging the need to support their capacity to prevent and eliminate child, \nearly and forced marriage, and reaffirming that the best interests of the child will be \ntheir basic concern; \n \n11. \nUrges Governments, while addressing child, early and forced marriage, to \nconfront family poverty and social exclusion through investing in family-oriented \npolicies addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, focusing on education, \nhealth, employment, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion, paying special \nattention to gender-sensitive social protection measures, child allowances for parents \nand pension benefits for older persons and protecting, supporting and empowering \nchildren, including girls, in child-headed households; \n \n12. Also urges Governments, with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders, \nto tackle poverty, lack of economic opportunities for women and girls and other \nentrenched economic incentives that act as drivers of child, early and forced marriage, \nincluding by ensuring the rights of women and girls to inheritance and property, their \nequal access with men and boys to social protection, childcare services and direct \nfinancial services, to encourage girls to continue their education, including through \ntheir re-enrolment in school after childbirth, to develop livelihood opportunities \nthrough access to technical and vocational education and training and life skills \neducation, including financial literacy, and to promote freedom of movement, \nwomen\u2019s equal access to full and productive employment and decent work, as well as \nequal political participation and rights to inherit, own and control land and productive \nmeasures; \n\nChild, early and forced marriage \nA/RES/75/167\n \n7/11\n20-17337 \n \n \n13.
