Treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear \nweapons or other nuclear explosive devices \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecalling its resolution 48/75 L of 16 December 1993 and all subsequent \nresolutions and decisions on the subject of a treaty banning the production of fissile \nmaterial for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, \n \nMarking 30 years since the adoption of resolution 48/75 L and, in that regard, \nnoting with grave concern the lack of substantial progress towards a treaty banning the \nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, \n \nStressing the importance of political will to make progress and welcoming the \ncommemorative high-level event entitled \u201cWhittle down fissile material, whittle down \nnuclear weapons\u201d, aimed at refocusing political attention on the matter, held on the \nmargins of high-level week of the General Assembly in September 2023 in this regard, \n \nMindful of the continuing importance and relevance of the Conference on \nDisarmament, and recalling the past achievements of that body in successfully \nnegotiating non-proliferation and disarmament agreements, \n \nGravely concerned by the years of stalemate in the Conference on Disarmament, \nregretting that negotiations have not been pursued on this issue, and looking forward \nto the Conference again fulfilling its mandate as the world\u2019s single multilateral \ndisarmament negotiating forum, \n \nConvinced that a non-discriminatory, multilateral and effectively verifiable \ntreaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear \nexplosive devices would represent a significant practical contribution to nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation efforts, \n\nA/RES/78/28 \nTreaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear \nweapons or other nuclear explosive devices\n \n23-24533\n2/3 \n \n \nRecognizing the essential role of fissile material in the manufacture of nuclear \nweapons or other nuclear explosive devices and the long-standing efforts of the \ninternational community to negotiate a treaty that would ban its production for such \npurposes, \n \nWelcoming the declared voluntary moratoriums by some nuclear-weapon States \non the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons as an important interim step \nbefore the entry into force of a non-discriminatory, multilateral and effectively \nverifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or \nother nuclear explosive devices, \n \nRecognizing that a future treaty should not prohibit the production of fissile \nmaterial for non-proscribed military purposes or civilian use, consistent with the \nobligations of States parties to such a treaty, or interfere in any other way with a \nState\u2019s right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy, \n \nRecalling actions 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the conclusions and recommendations for \nfollow-on actions agreed by consensus at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties \nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1  \n \nNoting with appreciation the consensus report of the Group of Governmental \nExperts, mandated in resolution 67/53 of 3 December 2012, as contained in document \nA/70/81, \n \nNoting with appreciation also the work accomplished in 2017 and 2018 by the \nhigh-level fissile material cut-off treaty expert preparatory group convened by the \nSecretary-General following resolution 71/259 of 23 December 2016, on the basis of \nequitable geographical distribution, to consider and make recommendations on \nsubstantial elements of a future non-discriminatory, multilateral and effectively \nverifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or \nother nuclear explosive devices, on the basis of document CD/1299 and the mandate \ncontained therein, \n \nNoting with concern that the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was not able to make progress \nin facilitating negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a treaty banning the \nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, \nas called for in resolution 76/51 of 6 December 2021, \n \nReaffirming the need to ensure the equal, full and meaningful participation of \nwomen in the negotiation process of a future treaty, \n \nReaffirming also its desire to achieve substantive progress in nuclear \nnon-proliferation and disarmament, and in particular on a non-discriminatory, \nmultilateral and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material \nfor nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, \n \n1. \nUrges the Conference on Disarmament to immediately commence \nnegotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons \nor other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of document CD/1299 and the mandate \ncontained therein; \n \n2. \nCalls upon Member States to make innovative contributions in all \nappropriate formal
