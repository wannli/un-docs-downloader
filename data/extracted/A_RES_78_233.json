Notes that the global macroeconomic outlook remains highly uncertain, and \nis particularly bleak for many developing countries, including a large number of least \ndeveloped countries, faced with growing debt service burdens and tight fiscal \nconstraints and that such a finance divide will, if left unaddressed, translate into a \nlasting sustainable development divide; and calls for improved international debt \nmechanisms to support debt review, debt payment suspensions, and debt restructuring, \nas appropriate, with an expansion of support and eligibility to vulnerable countries in \nneed;  \n \n20. Calls upon official creditors to make long-term sustainable financing \navailable to least developed countries through grants and concessional funding and to \noffer more fixed-interest lending at low interest rates, emphasizing that this is part of \na mix of financing approaches that also include grants;  \n\nA/RES/78/233 \nFollow-up to the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least \nDeveloped Countries\n \n23-26237\n8/14 \n \n \n21.

Welcomes that the parties19 urged developed country parties to deliver in \nfull on the 100 billion dollar goal urgently and through to 2025 and emphasizes the \nimportance of transparency in the implementation of their pledges, also welcomes \nthat they urged the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, \nmultilateral development banks and other financial institutions to further scale up \ninvestment in climate action, and calls for a continued increase in the scale and \neffectiveness of climate finance from all sources globally, including grants and other \nhighly concessional forms of finance;  \n \n24. Notes that in 2021, electrification rates in the least developed countries \ncontinued to rise but remained low, at 56 per cent, 481 million people in the least \ndeveloped countries were without any access to electricity in 2021, which was almost \ntwo thirds of the total global population living without access to electricity, and urgent \ninternational attention is needed to address the inequalities in access to sustainable \nenergy that are faced by the least developed countries, and encourages the doubling \nof international public finance and the mobilization of resources from all sources to \nmeet the urgent need for investment in power generation and transmission;  \n \n25.
