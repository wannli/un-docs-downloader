Fund, Progress on Household Drinking \nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene 2000\u20132017: Special Focus on Inequalities (Geneva, 2019). \n\nA/RES/74/141 \nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation\n \n19-22240\n4/8 \n \nin many parts of the world, restricting their time for other activities, such as education \nand leisure, or, for women, for earning a livelihood, \n \nDeeply alarmed that water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases hit children \nthe hardest, while noting that child diarrhoea is the second leading cause of death in \nchildren under 5 years of age, and underscoring that progress on reducing child \nmortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children\u2019s and women\u2019s access to safe \ndrinking water and sanitation and that, in humanitarian emergencies and crises, \nincluding in times of armed conflict or natural disaster, children suffer the most from \ninterruptions in water and sanitation services,  \n \nDeeply concerned that persons with disabilities, especially children, often face \nbarriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities that are accessible and appropriate \nto their needs, which has an impact on their ability to live independently and \nparticipate fully in all aspects of life, including education and employment, which is \nparticularly concerning with regard to homelessness and humanitarian emergencies \nand crises, \n \nDeeply alarmed by indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting \ncivilian objects in armed conflict, which may injure personnel and cut off the power \nthat keeps water, sanitation and hygiene systems running, \n \nDeeply concerned that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation \nand menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information and \neducation thereon, are excluded and stigmatized, that their health can be negatively \naffected and that they are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, \n \nDeeply concerned also that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation \nservices, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, \nworkplaces, health centres and public facilities, negatively affects gender equality, \nthe empowerment of women and girls and their enjoyment of human rights, including \nthe right to education and the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard \nof physical and mental health, and recognizing that women have specific hygiene \nneeds during menstruation, pregnancy, childbearing and rearing and throughout the \nlife course, \n \nDeeply concerned further that women and girls are particularly at risk of and \nexposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to \ntheir safety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities \noutside their homes or, when lacking adequate sanitation facilities, practising open \ndefecation and urination, limiting their ability to move freely and safely in the public \nsphere, \n \nDeeply concerned that non-existent or inadequate sanitation facilities and \nserious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can negatively \naffect water provision and sustainable access to safe drinking water and that, \naccording to the United Nations World Water Development Report 2017, over 80 per \ncent of the world\u2019s wastewater, and over 95 per cent in some developing countries, is \nreleased into the environment without treatment,  \n \nAffirming the importance of regional and international cooperation, where \nappropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to \nsafe drinking water and sanitation, with the understanding that it has no bearing on \nthe issues of international water law, including international watercourse law,  \n \nExpressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to \ncontribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural \ndisasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full \nenjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and \n\nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation \nA/RES/74/141\n \n5/8\n19-22240 \n \nsanitation, and recalling the need to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience \nand reduce vulnerability to climate change, \n \nRecognizing that, while the implications of climate change-related impacts and \nenvironmental damage for the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water \nand sanitation affect individuals and communities around the world, the consequences \nare felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable \nsituations, such as people living in informal settlements, people living in small island \nStates and rural and local communities, and recognizing also that indigenous peoples, \nbecause of their specific situation and nature, may be among the first to face the direct \nconsequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close \nrelationship with the environment and its resources, \n \n1. \nReaffirms that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as \ncomponents of the right to an adequate standard of living, are essential for the full \nenjoyment of the right to life and all human rights;  \n \n2. \nRecognizes that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, \nwithout discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically \naccessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human \nright to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and \naffordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, \nsocially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while \nreaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of \nliving;  \n \n3. \nWelcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights \nCouncil on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and takes note of \nhis reports;  \n \n4. \nReaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full \nrealization of all human rights and to endeavour to take steps, individually and \nthrough international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical \ncooperation, to the maximum of their available resources, to progressively achieve \nthe full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate \nmeans, including, in particular, the adoption of legislative measures; \n \n5. \nCalls upon States:  \n \n(a) \nTo ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking \nwater and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating \ninequalities in access, including for individuals belonging to groups at risk and those \nwho are marginalized on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, \nreligion and national or social origin or on any other grounds;  \n \n(b) \nTo implement the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals \nand targets, 16  including the Goal on ensuring the availability and sustainable \nmanagement of water and sanitation for all, consistent with their obligations under \ninternational law;  \n \n(c) \nTo take into consideration the New Urban Agenda, 17 which envisages \ncities and human settlements that fulfil their social function, the full realization of the \nright to adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of \nliving, without discrimination, and universal access to safe and affordable drinking \nwater and sanitation;  \n__________________ \n \n16 See resolution 70/1. \n \n17 Resolution 71/256, annex. \n\nA/RES/74/141 \nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation\n \n19-22240\n6/8

alia, effective \nmenstrual hygiene management and adequate disposal options for menstrual products, \nwithout compromising their safety and dignity; \n \n(f) \nTo address the widespread stigma and shame surrounding menstruation \nand menstrual hygiene by promoting educational and health practices in order to \nfoster a culture in which menstruation is recognized as healthy and natural and by \nensuring access to factual information thereon, including for men and boys, \naddressing the negative social norms around the issue, as well as ensuring universal \naccess to hygienic products and gender-sensitive facilities, including disposal and \nwaste management options for menstrual products, while recognizing that women\u2019s \nand girls\u2019 attendance at school, university or, for women, work can be affected by \nnegative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain personal hygiene, \nsuch as safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools, public places and, for \nwomen, the workplace; \n \n(g) \nTo promote both women\u2019s leadership and their full, effective and equal \nparticipation in decision-making on water and sanitation management and to ensure \nthat a gender-based approach is adopted in relation to water and sanitation \nprogrammes; \n \n(h) \nTo reduce the time spent by women and girls in collecting household \nwater, in order to address the negative impact of inadequate water and sanitation \nservices on the access of girls to education, including through improved public \nservices and infrastructure; \n \n(i) \nTo promote safe public spaces and improve the security and safety of \nwomen and girls through gender-responsive rural and urban planning and \ninfrastructure when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or practising \nopen defecation and urination; \n \n(j) \nTo protect women and girls from being physically threatened or assaulted, \nincluding from sexual violence, while collecting household

communities and other stakeholders, including civil society \n\nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation \nA/RES/74/141\n \n7/8\n19-22240 \n \nand the private sector, on adequate solutions to ensure sustainable and \nnon-discriminatory access to safe drinking water and sanitation;  \n \n(n) \nTo enhance efforts to substantially reduce the share of untreated \nwastewater released into the environment and to ensure that plans and programmes \nfor improving sanitation services take into account the need for appropriate systems \nfor the treatment of wastewater produced, including disposal of infant faeces, with \nthe aim of reducing the risks to human health, drinking water resources and the \nenvironment; \n \n(o) \nTo identify patterns of failure to respect, protect or fulfil the human rights \nto safe drinking water and sanitation for all persons without discrimination and to \naddress their structural causes in policymaking and budgeting within a
