\nabductees and their families, and the lack of any concrete or positive action by the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, notably since the investigations on all the \nJapanese nationals commenced on the basis of the government-level consultations \nheld between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and Japan in May 2014 and \nthe identical and non-substantive replies by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea to the numerous communications transmitted by the Working Group on \nEnforced or Involuntary Disappearances, and strongly demanding again that the

Democratic People\u2019s Republic \nof Korea, including with respect to gender equality and the rights of all women and \ngirls, including adolescent girls, is intrinsically linked to international

\n \n(vii) Violations of economic, social and cultural rights, exacerbated by the \nnegative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the continued closure by the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea of its borders, which have led to food \ninsecurity, severe hunger, malnutrition, widespread health problems and other \nhardship for the population in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, in \nparticular for women, children, persons with disabilities, older persons and \npolitical prisoners; \n \n(viii) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and \ngirls, including unequal access to employment and discriminatory regulations; \nas well as, in particular, the creation of internal conditions that force women \nand girls to leave the country, making them extremely vulnerable to trafficking \nin persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation, forced labour, domestic \nservitude or forced marriage, and their subjection to sexual and gender-based \ndiscrimination, including in the political and social spheres, as well as in \ndetention, including through forced abortions and other forms of sexual and \ngender-based violence;
