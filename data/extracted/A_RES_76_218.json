reduction has started to stagnate in \ndeveloping countries, owing to, inter alia, the global economic slowdown, conflicts \nand the vulnerability of States to climate change and disasters, noting the heightened \ninternational policy uncertainty with regard to trade and weaker global growth and \nthat per capita gross domestic product growth in many regions is significantly below \nthe rates needed to eradicate poverty, and reiterating that those left behind are \nbecoming increasingly harder to reach, especially those living in rural areas and in \nvulnerable situations,  \n \nNoting

\nachieving the Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030, making the \nworld\u2019s pledge to leave no one behind and to endeavour to reach those furthest behind \nfirst much more difficult to achieve, as the pandemic is expected to push up to \n97 million people into extreme poverty, the biggest increase for decades, with the \nshare of the world\u2019s population living in extreme poverty forecast to have increased \nfrom 11.6 per cent in 2020,8 acknowledging that the world gross domestic product \ncontracted by 3.1 per cent in 2020 and that the expected rebound of 5.9

high levels of inequality, recognizing that, despite \nmassive policy support, the estimated 8.5 trillion United States dollars in cumulative \noutput losses during 2020 and 2021 may erase nearly all output gains of the previous \nfour years, and that COVID-19 has laid bare the immense challenges facing the world, \nranging from inadequate health infrastructure to the lack of universal basic social \nprotection, making the implementation of the Third United Nations Decade for the \nEradication of Poverty (2018\u20132027) especially challenging,  \n \nUnderlining that the Third United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty \n(2018\u20132027), on the theme \u201cAccelerating global actions for a world without poverty\u201d, \nwill be important for maintaining the momentum generated by the implementation of \nthe Second Decade towards poverty eradication and ensuring that markets work better \nfor people living in poverty,  \n \nReaffirming that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, that \nits adverse impacts undermine the ability of all countries to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment, that increases in global temperature, sea level rise, ocean acidification \nand other climate change impacts are seriously affecting coastal areas and low-lying \ncoastal countries, including many least developed countries and small island \ndeveloping States, and that the survival of many societies and of the biological support \nsystems of the planet is at risk, which further threatens food security and efforts to \neradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and thus requires urgent action \nto maintain, preserve and sustain the development gains achieved in the past decades, \n \nUrging all countries that have not yet done so to ratify and accede to the United \nNations Convention against Corruption,9 encouraging parties to review its \nimplementation, committing to making the Convention an effective instrument to \ndeter,

the importance of policy coherence and a coordinated approach \nthat involves participation at all levels by all actors to promote an enabling \nenvironment for sustainable development, and of
