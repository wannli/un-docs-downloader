that the survival of many societies and of the \nbiological support systems of the planet is at risk, which further threatens food \nsecurity and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and \nthus requires urgent action to maintain, preserve and sustain the development gains \nachieved in the past decades,  \n \nUrging all countries that have not yet done so to ratify and accede to the United \nNations Convention against Corruption, 10  encouraging parties to review its \nimplementation, committing to making the Convention an effective instrument to \ndeter,
