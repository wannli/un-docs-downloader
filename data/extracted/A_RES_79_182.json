human rights in \nMyanmar, especially those of women, children and older persons, as well as those of \npersons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities, including Rohingya Muslims, \nowing to the heavy militarization of Myanmar aggravated by the continued access to \narms from abroad that increases the ability of the Myanmar military to commit serious \nviolations of international human rights

\noperations,  \n\nSituation of human rights of Rohingya Muslims and other \nminorities in Myanmar \nA/RES/79/182\n \n7/18\n24-24224 \n \n \nReiterating the urgent need to ensure that all those

\n \nExpressing deep concern that, in Rakhine, more than 600,000 Rohingya \nMuslims remain largely segregated and discriminated against with respect to \naccessing citizenship and enjoying their human

psychosocial \ncare and education, as well as livelihoods, \n \nExpressing its concern that Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, in \nparticular women and girls, remain at significant risk of sexual and gender-based \nviolence, notably in the context of the continued conflict between the Myanmar \nsecurity and armed forces and the Arakan Army,  \n \nContinuing to underline the need for the Myanmar military and other armed \ngroups to cease all actions that run counter to the protection of all persons within the \ncountry, including those belonging to the Rohingya community, by

steps to ensure justice in respect of all human rights violations \nand violations of international humanitarian law so that those displaced by violence \nare able to voluntarily return in safety and dignity to their places of origin or to a \nplace of their choice in a sustainable manner, \n \nAlarmed at the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Myanmar, the \ncontinued attacks on medical and humanitarian personnel, the lack of basic healthcare \nand lifesaving assistance, and the denial of safe, rapid and unhindered humanitarian \naccess, and calling for all parties to the conflict, in particular the Myanmar military, \nto abide by international law, including international humanitarian law, in this matter, \nand to enable humanitarian actors to deliver humanitarian aid consistent with the \nhumanitarian principles of humanity, independence, neutrality and impartiality,  \n \nNoting with deep concern that the lack of sufficient humanitarian access, \nespecially to food, in particular to areas with internally displaced persons and to the \nareas from which many people have been and continue to be forcibly displaced and \nin which many others, such as Rohingya Muslims, are living in precarious conditions \nis exacerbating the humanitarian crisis, which may lead to hunger-induced \ndisplacement and more influx to Bangladesh, \n \nCalling upon all parties, including the Myanmar military and other armed actors, \nto allow full, safe, timely and unhindered humanitarian access for international \nhumanitarian agencies, medical personnel and aid workers,

of families to be informed about the health and conditions \nof prisoners, as well as on prisoners\u2019 access to necessary healthcare, \n \nReiterating its deep distress at reports that unarmed individuals in Rakhine State \nhave been subjected to the excessive use of force and to violations and abuses of \nhuman rights and violations of international humanitarian law by the Myanmar \nmilitary, including those involving extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary killings, \nsystematic rape and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence, arbitrary \ndetention, enforced disappearance

evicted and their homes destroyed, and remaining \nconcerned by the previous large-scale destruction of homes and systematic evictions \nin northern Rakhine State, including the use of arson and violence, as well as the \nunlawful use of force by non-State actors,  \n \nExpressing concern that, in northern Rakhine State, the implementation of \npolicies under the guise of economic development and reconstruction by the Myanmar \nmilitary and the heavy militarization of the area have resulted in the alteration of the \ndemographic structure, which further prevents the members of the displaced \nRohingya Muslim population from returning to their places of origin or a place of \ntheir choice in Rakhine State,  \n \nStressing the need for an immediate end to all forms of violence, de-escalation \nand an enduring ceasefire throughout Myanmar, best achieved by dialogue between \nall parties,  \n \nUnderlining the need for the resumption of peacebuilding efforts and their \nrelevance for inclusive State- and nation-building,  \n \nEmphasizing the importance of supporting women\u2019s leadership and full, equal \nand meaningful participation in inclusive State- and nation-building, especially by \namplifying their potential in Myanmar as multipliers of peace, promoting social \ncohesion across different ethnic and religious communities, and thus welcoming the \ndevelopment of the women and peace and security platform in Myanmar, \nco-facilitated by the former Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Myanmar and \nthe former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, \n \nReiterating its grave concern that, in spite of the fact that the Rohingya minority \nhas lived in Myanmar for generations prior to the independence of Myanmar, held \nfull documentation and participated actively in government and civic life, they were \nmade stateless by the enactment of the 1982 Citizenship Law and were eventually \ndisenfranchised, from 2015, from the electoral process, \n \nReaffirming that the denial of citizenship status and related rights to Rohingya \nMuslims and other minorities, including voting rights, is a serious human rights \nconcern, \n \nRe-emphasizing the right of all refugees and the importance of internally \ndisplaced persons to be able to return home and that such returns should be in safety \nand dignity and in a voluntary and sustainable manner, and reminding the \ninternational community of its collective responsibility towards the forcibly displaced \npersons, including Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, in the region,  \n \nExpressing concern at the irregular maritime movement of Rohingya, risking \ntheir lives in perilous conditions at the hands of exploitative traffickers and \nsmugglers, which highlights their desperate situation and the urgent need to address \nthe root causes of their vulnerability,  \n \nAlarmed by the continued influx from Myanmar to Bangladesh over the last four \ndecades, with 32,000 newborn children adding to the population every year in the \ncamps in Bangladesh, leading to the presence of around 1.2 million Rohingyas in \nBangladesh, the majority of whom have arrived since 25 August 2017 in the aftermath \nof atrocities committed by the Myanmar military, with at least 45,000 crossings to \nBangladesh since June 2024 as a result of the intensification of armed conflict in \nNorthern Rakhine, \n \nAlarmed at the deaths and injuries of several persons, including citizens in the \nterritory of Bangladesh, when mortar shells and bullets exchanged between the

in Rakhine State, \n \nUnderscoring the urgent need for the renewal and subsequent implementation \nof the memorandum of understanding between Myanmar and the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Refugees on assistance in the repatriation process of all displaced persons from \nRakhine State, including Rohingya Muslims, and calling

over the continued spread of false news and \ninformation, hate speech and inflammatory rhetoric, in particular through social \nmedia, notably targeting Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, and at the findings \nof the Independent Mechanism for Myanmar in its recent report that coordinated and \norganized hate speech campaign on Facebook by the Myanmar military against \nRohingya Muslims and other minorities had helped to fuel mass violence and \nsubsequently mass exodus of Rohingya in 2017, expressing concern that this \ncampaign, using social media, is still taking place unabated, and condemning all \ninstances of hate speech, \n \nReiterating its deep concern also at the restrictions and attacks on civil society, \njournalists and media workers, including restrictions on seeking, receiving and \nimparting information, including Internet shutdowns in Myanmar, that may also \nexacerbate further the plight of Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, \n \nUnderlining the importance of the call by the Secretary-General for increased \nefforts to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine \nState, to address the root causes of the crisis, including those

pledges to dismantle the discriminatory legal \nframework that exacerbated the human rights violations against the Rohingya \nMuslims and other minorities, and stressing the need to implement the
