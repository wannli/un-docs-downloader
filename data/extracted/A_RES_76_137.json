General \nAssembly and to other United Nations meetings, \n \nReaffirming the importance of involving youth, and youth-led and youth-\nfocused organizations, in the work of the United Nations at the national, regional and \ninternational levels in all matters of concern to them, including in the implementation \nof the World Programme of Action for Youth and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment, \n \nRecognizing that a youthful population creates significant opportunities for \ndevelopment, and underlining in this regard the importance of the creation by Member \nStates of appropriate policy environments, in collaboration with the United Nations \nsystem, in order to realize a demographic dividend driven by large proportions of \nyoung people moving into the labour force, while adopting an inclusive and \nsustainable approach to development planning and implementation, with full respect \nfor human rights, \n \nReaffirming that generating decent work and quality employment for youth is \none of the biggest challenges that needs to be tackled, and emphasizing the priority \nareas of the World Programme of Action for Youth linked to the employability of \nyouth, including quality education and health, and access to information and \ntechnology, and bearing in mind that, before the beginning of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic, 67.2 million youth were unemployed and 118.3 million youth \nwere living with their families in poverty, including more than 51 million in extreme \npoverty, and with the pandemic these numbers are likely to have increased, \n \nEmphasizing the need to empower youth, including young women and girls, in \norder to achieve sustainable development, and stressing in this regard the commitment \nin the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to eradicate poverty and \nsubstantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training \nand to develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment, and in this \nregard takes note of the call for action of the International Labour Organization on \nthe youth employment crisis and the Global Initiative on Decent Jobs for Youth, \n \nEmphasizing also the need to substantially increase the number of youth and \nadults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for \nemployment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, and to ensure, by 2030, that all youth \nand a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and \nnumeracy, \n \nExpressing concern about the spread of disinformation and misinformation, \nincluding among young people, particularly on social media platforms, which can be \ndesigned and implemented so as to mislead, to spread racism, xenophobia, negative \nstereotyping and stigmatization, to violate and abuse human rights, including the right \nto privacy, to impede freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive \nand impart information, and to incite all forms of violence, hatred, intolerance, \ndiscrimination and hostility, and emphasizing the important contribution of \njournalists, civil society and academia in countering this trend, \n \nRecognizing that, while young people represent almost one quarter of the online \npopulation, they often lack job-relevant digital skills and knowledge to ensure their \naccess to the labour market, and that building the digital skills of young people is \ncrucial to boosting their future employability and social inclusion, by providing them, \nincluding young women and girls, access to educational resources online and \nnecessary digital tools, \n \nRecognizing also that the use of technology, specifically digital platforms, can \nmitigate the loss of education and learning opportunities caused by school closures, \nwhile expressing concern that the poorest and most vulnerable children and young \n\nPolicies and programmes involving youth \nA/RES/76/137\n \n5/12\n21-19170 \n \npeople are least likely to live in a suitable home-learning environment with an \nadequate Internet connection and learning support, \n \nRecognizing further that many countries are making progress towards achieving \nuniversal health coverage by 2030 and that the good health and well-being of young \npeople are closely intertwined with their capacity to complete their education and \nseize employment opportunities, \n \nNoting with concern that globally HIV continues to disproportionately impact \nyoung people, particularly young women, and that young people\u2019s knowledge and \nawareness of HIV and AIDS and access to and use of essential HIV-related services, \nincluding HIV testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis, remain unacceptably low, that \ncondom use is on the decline and that young people, who represent 16 per cent of the \nglobal population, account for 28 per cent of new HIV infections, while stressing the \nneed to create an environment that does not allow the dissemination of scientifically \ninaccurate information about HIV, including HIV denialism, \n \nRecognizing that young women between the ages of 15 and 24 are most \nvulnerable to HIV, experiencing infection rates two or three times as high as those of \nyoung men, depending on the region, as well as many health-related threats and \nchallenges, \n \nRecognizing also that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disproportionately \nimpact young people, including young women and girls, and those who are in \nvulnerable situations, and that responses to the COVID-19 pandemic need to take into \naccount multiple and intersecting forms of violence, discrimination, stigmatization, \nexclusion and inequalities, \n \nRecognizing further that the multidimensional impacts of COVID-19 have \nplaced unprecedented pressures on youth, and that, in order to achieve an equitable \nrecovery from the pandemic, and to build back better, action is urgently needed to \ncoordinate multisectoral investments to improve youth health and nutrition, mental \nhealth and well-being, education, information and communications technologies, \nsafety and resilience and accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development \nGoals, \n \nNoting with concern that incidences of discrimination and violence have been \nexacerbated by the pandemic, and that young women and girls have been \ndisproportionately disadvantaged, resulting in a surge in young women and girls \ndropping out of school, adolescent pregnancies and unintended pregnancies, child, \nearly and forced marriage, limited access to health-care services and a reduction in \nprogress towards ending female genital mutilation, \n \nNoting with concern also that, owing to school closures, the COVID-19 \npandemic has exposed the digital divide, both between and within countries, \nincluding the gender digital divide and vast disparities in the availability of learning \nmaterials, including access to the Internet, and communication devices, and that even \nthough much focus has turned to remote learning platforms, many public schools, \nespecially in developing countries, are not set up to use them or do not have the \ntechnology and equipment to provide online teaching, which leads to limited or lack \nof education for many young people, especially young women and girls, \n \nNoting the development of guiding principles and tools, for consideration by \nStates, on the human rights obligations of States to provide public education,  \n \n1. \nTakes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General;22 \n__________________ \n \n22 A/76/210. \n\nA/RES/76/137 \nPolicies and programmes involving youth\n \n21-19170\n6/12 \n \n \n2. \nReaffirms the World Programme of Action for

real opportunities for full, effective, constructive and \nsustainable participation in society, including in relevant decision-making processes \nand monitoring, in all spheres of political, economic, social and cultural life, \nincluding in designing and implementing policies, programmes and initiatives, in \nparticular, while implementing the 2030 Agenda; \n \n4. \nRecognizes that 49 per cent of the world\u2019s population is under 30 and only \n2.6 per cent of members of parliament belong to this age group, encourages the \nincrease of youth representation in national and local legislatures; \n \n5. \nReiterates that the primary responsibility for implementing the World \nProgramme of Action for Youth lies with Member States, and urges Governments, in \nconsultation with youth, youth-led and youth-focused organizations and other \nrelevant stakeholders, to develop integrated, holistic, inclusive and effective youth \npolicies and programmes, as well as coherent cross-sectoral efforts, based on the \nProgramme of Action and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to \nevaluate them regularly as part of the follow-up action on and implementation of the \nProgramme of Action at all levels; \n \n6. \nUrges Member States to protect, promote and fulfil the realization and full \nenjoyment by all young people of all human rights and fundamental

them to contribute as active members of society to the \npolitical, civil, economic, social, and cultural development of their countries; \n \n8. \nCalls upon Member States to consider, on a voluntary basis, the indicators \nproposed in the report of the Secretary-General25 for their selection and adaptation in \nmonitoring and assessing the implementation of the World Programme of Action for \nYouth, giving particular attention to young women, marginalized groups and young \npeople belonging to vulnerable groups or in vulnerable situations, especially those \naffected by armed conflict,
