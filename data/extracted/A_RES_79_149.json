Sustainable Development Goals by, for and \nwith Persons with Disabilities, the executive summary of which presents an overview \nof the progress of the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals for persons \nwith disabilities, and the persistent gaps between persons with disabilities and without \ndisabilities, particularly in the spheres of food security, health, access to energy, \naccess to information and communications technology, multidimensional poverty and \nemployment \u2013 gaps that are wider for women with disabilities, Indigenous persons \nwith disabilities, persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities and persons \nwith disabilities in rural areas \u2013 and proposes recommended actions for the effective \nimplementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the \ndisability-inclusive achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, \n \nRecognizing that persons with disabilities make up an estimated 16 per cent of \nthe world\u2019s population, or 1.3 billion people, of whom an estimated 80 per cent live \nin developing countries, and that persons with disabilities are disproportionately \naffected by poverty, \n \nWelcoming progress towards mainstreaming disability, including the rights of \npersons with disabilities, in the work of the United Nations, and noting with \nappreciation the contributions of the Steering Committee on Accessibility and of the \nUnited Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as well as the \nprogress made in the implementation of the United Nations

and decision-making processes related thereto, as well \nas empowering them to publicly lead and promote universally accessible response, \nrecovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction approaches, in order to ensure disability-\ninclusive risk reduction and humanitarian action, and recognizing further the special \ncoping mechanisms developed by persons with disabilities to withstand, respond to

\nsafe, \n \nRecognizing further the contribution of families towards ensuring the full \nenjoyment by persons with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms \non an equal basis with

\napplication and implementation of the international normative framework on persons \nwith disabilities and human rights and development, \n \nConcerned that access to healthcare services and assistive devices and \ntechnologies remains a challenge for persons with disabilities, who are more than \nthree times as likely as persons without disabilities to be unable to obtain healthcare \nwhen they need it, especially women and girls with disabilities, owing to, inter alia, \na lack of financial resources, inaccessible public transport and facilities and \nattitudinal and other environmental barriers, \n \nReaffirming the right of every human being, without distinction of any kind, to \nthe enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, \n

\n\nInclusive development for and with persons with disabilities \nA/RES/79/149\n \n5/12\n24-24136 \n \ndevelopment policies and programmes, and, in particular, into the implementation of \nthe 2030 Agenda, \n \nNoting the need for Member States, the United Nations system and other \nstakeholders to further strengthen the normative framework on disability, including \nthe rights of persons with

and consider disability as a global \nissue, cutting across the pillars of the United Nations, \n \nStressing its resolve to build inclusive societies and, in this regard, the \nimportance of mainstreaming the rights, participation, perspectives, needs and well-\nbeing of persons with disabilities into all relevant strategies and programmes for \nsustainable development, and reaffirming the valued existing and potential \ncontributions made by persons with disabilities to the overall well-being and diversity \nof their communities, \n \nRecognizing the rights of persons with disabilities with respect to full, \nmeaningful and effective participation and inclusion in society, and therefore \nrecognizing also that persons with disabilities should have the opportunity to be

policies and programmes, including national and international \ndevelopment programmes, as well as policies and actions to implement the 2030 \nAgenda, with a view to ensuring that such policies and

society \nis critical to ensuring that no one is left behind, \n \nRecognizing also the role and contribution of persons with disabilities in \nsustainable and inclusive economic growth, including through micro-, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, and the importance of skills development training on \nmicro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, including for persons with disabilities, \n \nUnderlining the need for urgent action by all stakeholders towards the adoption \nand implementation of more ambitious disability-inclusive national development plans, \nstrategies and actions, backed by increased international cooperation and support, \n \nStressing the need for capacity development efforts aimed at empowering \npersons with disabilities and their representative organizations to ensure equal access \nto inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities, full \nand productive employment and decent work on an equal basis and without \ndiscrimination to persons with disabilities, including by promoting access to inclusive \neducation systems, skills development, including digital literacy, volunteering \nopportunities and vocational and entrepreneurial training in order to enable persons \nwith disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence and reach their full \npotential, \n \nRecognizing the importance of promoting accessibility, mobility and road safety \nfor persons with disabilities in the context of cities and other human settlements, and \nthat accessibility is a means of achieving inclusive societies and development, \n \nRecognizing also the growing contribution of sport to the realization of \ndevelopment and peace, and stressing that major international sporting events, such \nas the international Paralympic Games, should be organized in the spirit of peace, \nmutual understanding, friendship and tolerance, where persons with disabilities have \nan opportunity to organize, develop and participate in disability-specific sporting and \nrecreational activities, on an equal basis with others, and where the spirit of fair play \nprevails, violence is banned and ethical principles are upheld, \n\nA/RES/79/149 \nInclusive development for and with persons with disabilities\n \n24-24136\n6/12 \n \n \nConcerned that the continuing lack of available, accessible, high-quality, timely \nand reliable statistics, data and information on the situation of persons with \ndisabilities at the national, regional and global levels contributes to their exclusion in \nofficial statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving sustainable development \nplanning and implementation of policies and programmes that are inclusive of persons \nwith disabilities, recognizing that high-quality, timely, accessible, reliable and \ndisaggregated data are critical to measuring progress and ensuring that no one is left \nbehind, and further noting the need for enhancing capacity-building support to \ndeveloping countries, including the least developed countries and small island \ndeveloping States, to increase significantly the availability of such data, including \nthrough information and communications technologies and systems, \n \nStressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons \nwith disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics, 21  and their \nupdates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to \ndisaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, \nand underlining the need for internationally comparable data, such as but not limited \nto the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund Module on Child Functioning and the tools \nand materials produced by the Washington Group on Disability Statistics, to assess \nprogress on development policies that are inclusive of persons with disabilities, \n \nConcerned that the lack of high-quality data required to provide viable baselines \nand measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals for persons with \ndisabilities poses a significant challenge to effectively monitor the implementation of \nthe 2030 Agenda for persons with disabilities, and in this regard welcoming the call \nfor the disaggregation of data by disability in the 2030 Agenda, which recognizes the \nneed to significantly increase the availability of high-quality, accessible, timely and \nreliable data to measure progress in the implementation of the Goals for persons with \ndisabilities, \n \n1. \nTakes note with appreciation of
