including from economic \nexploitation, \n \nRecognizing that women and girls are frequently subjected to violence, \nincluding sexual harassment, at work and that women and girls face increased risks \nof violence, including sexual harassment, in particular contexts, such as when \nworking alone, when working in male-dominated workplaces, when working outside \nthe normal working hours or when working in the same place where they live, bearing \nin mind the large number of women and girls worldwide who have reported being \nvictims of sexual harassment in their workplace, and concerned that, owing to \nunderreporting, the actual number may be much greater, \n \nStressing the need to change social norms that condone violence against women \nand girls in the workplace, including through, but not limited to, training and \nawareness-raising campaigns conducted in the workplace, associated with a change \nin attitudes and increased knowledge about sexual harassment, particularly among \nmen and boys, \n \nDeeply concerned that school-related violence against girls, including sexual \nviolence and harassment on the way to and from and at school, such as violence \nperpetrated by school staff, including teachers, and other pupils, continues to deter \ngirls from accessing and pursuing an education and, in many cases, the transition to \nand completion of secondary education, and that these risks may influence the \ndecision of parents to allow girls to attend school, \n \nUnderscoring that often lack of information and awareness, fear of reprisals, \npersisting impunity, insufficient recourse for violence against women and girls and \nnegative social norms, including when leading to shame or stigma, as well as negative \neconomic consequences, such as, inter alia, loss of livelihood or reduced income, \nprevent many women and, as applicable, girls from reporting or acting as witnesses \nand from seeking redress and justice in cases of sexual harassment, \n \nDeeply concerned about all acts of violence, including sexual harassment, \nagainst women and girls involved in political and public life, including women in \nleadership positions, journalists and other media workers and human rights defenders, \n \nRecognizing that the growing impact of violence against women and girls, \nincluding sexual harassment, in digital contexts, especially on social media, its \nimpunity and the lack of preventive measures and remedies underline the need for \naction by Member States, in partnership with relevant stakeholders, and that such \nviolence may include stalking, death threats and threats of sexual and gender-based \nviolence, as well as related trends against women and girls in digital contexts, such \nas trolling, cyberbullying and other forms of cyberharassment, including unwanted \nverbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature, with a view to discrediting women \nand girls and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, \n \nAcknowledging the importance of combating trafficking in persons in order to \nprevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual \nharassment, and in this regard stressing the importance of the full and effective \nimplementation of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in \nPersons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations \nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime,15 as well as of the United Nations \nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons,16

of\nviolence against women and girls: sexual harassment\n \n18-22185\n4/9 \n \n \nEmphasizing that the lack or inadequacy of documentation, research and data, \nincluding disaggregated data, on sexual harassment against women and girls impedes \nefforts to design and implement measures, including, where appropriate, policies and \nlegislation, to prevent and eliminate this form of violence, \n \nStressing that laws addressing violence against women and girls, including \nsexual harassment, are often of limited scope, that those addressing sexual harassment \ndo not cover many workplaces, such as those of domestic workers, including migrant \ndomestic workers, and that gaps need to be addressed, \n \nStressing also that, while the obligation and the primary responsibility to \npromote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms lie with the State, \nemployers and education providers have the primary responsibility to take measures \nto prevent sexual harassment in the workplace and at educational institutions, \nrespectively, \n \nStressing further that States, employers and education providers should take \nimmediate, appropriate corrective action after sexual harassment has occurred by \nholding perpetrators to account and providing access to timely and appropriate \nremedies and protection for victims and witnesses, bearing in mind that victims of \nsexual harassment may be subjected to further discrimination or reprisals, \n \nRecognizing the increase in public awareness and advocacy on sexual \nharassment, and stressing the need to accelerate government action to tackle sexual \nharassment, \n \nHighlighting the crucial role that educational and awareness-raising \nprogrammes, policies and legislation play in preventing and eliminating sexual \nharassment against women and girls, \n \nStressing the need to fully engage men and boys as strategic partners and allies \nin achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and in \npreventing and eliminating sexual harassment, \n \nRecognizing the critical contribution of family members in combating violence \nagainst women and girls, including sexual harassment, by, inter alia, providing for a \nsupportive environment for the empowerment of all women and girls, and that, in \npreventing such violence, the family can play an important role, \n \n1. \nStrongly condemns all forms of violence against all women and girls, \nincluding sexual harassment, recognizing that it is an impediment to the achievement \nof gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and to the full \nrealization of their human rights; \n \n2. \nAcknowledges that sexual harassment is a form of violence and a violation \nand abuse of human rights that is likely to result in physical, psychological, sexual, \neconomic or social harm or suffering; \n \n3. \nStresses that sexual harassment encompasses a continuum of unacceptable \nand unwelcome behaviours and practices of a sexual nature that may include, but are \nnot limited to, sexual suggestions or demands, requests for sexual favours and sexual, \nverbal or physical conduct or gestures, that are or might reasonably be perceived as \noffensive or humiliating; \n \n4. \nUrges States to condemn violence against women and girls, including \nsexual harassment, and reaffirms that they should not invoke any custom, tradition or \nreligious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination and \nshould pursue, by all appropriate means and without delay, a policy of eliminating \nviolence against women, as set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence \nagainst Women;9 \n\nIntensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of \nviolence against women and girls: sexual harassment \nA/RES/73/148\n \n5/9\n18-22185 \n \n \n5. \nCalls upon States to address discrimination based on multiple and \nintersecting factors, which places women and girls at greater risk of exploitation, \nviolence and abuse, and to take appropriate action to empower and protect them as \nwell as achieve their full enjoyment of human rights without discrimination; \n \n6. \nNotes that efforts by civil society organizations in eliminating violence \nagainst women and girls are complementary to those of Governments, and in this \nregard urges States to support, where possible, non-State-led initiatives aimed at \npromoting gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and at \npreventing, responding to and protecting women and girls from sexual harassment; \n \n7. \nEncourages national legislative authorities and political parties, as \nappropriate, to adopt codes of conduct and reporting mechanisms, or revise existing \nones, stating zero

violence, sexual exploitation \nand inequalities, to promote zero tolerance for such violence and to remove the stigma \nof being a victim and survivor of violence, thus creating an enabling and accessible \nenvironment where women and girls can easily report incidents of violence and make \nuse of the services available, including protection and assistance programmes; \n \n(g) \nTaking measures to ensure that all officials, including those in leadership \npositions, responsible for implementing policies and programmes aimed at preventing \nviolence against women and girls, including
