bullying often includes a gender dimension and is associated \nwith gender-based violence and stereotyping that negatively affects both boys and girls, \n \nNoting the risks associated with the use of new information and communications \ntechnologies and applications, including increased vulnerability to bullying, while \nstressing that they can create new ways to enhance education and, inter alia, foster \nlearning and teaching on the rights of the child and can be useful tools to promote \nchildren\u2019s protection, including with appropriate guidance from parents and legal \nguardians, with the best interests of the child as a primary consideration, \n \nNoting also the role that information and communications technologies play in \nreducing the risk of sexual exploitation and abuse,

protection from \nthe risks associated with bullying, including cyberbullying, and in preventing all \nforms of violence, including by promoting children\u2019s online safety, \n \nRecognizing that

that fully \nrespect all human rights and help to prevent and address bullying, constitute best \npractices that should be developed, strengthened and shared through international \ncooperation, \n \nAcknowledging that children are uniquely placed to inform effective solutions \nand responses to bullying, including cyberbullying, and underlining that children\u2019s \nparticipation and their
