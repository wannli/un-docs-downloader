Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030,6 the New Urban Agenda7 \nand the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change,8  \n \nReaffirming also that small island developing States remain a special case for \nsustainable development, renewing thus our solidarity with them, as they continue to \nface the combined challenges arising, in particular, from their geographical \nremoteness, the small scale of their economies, high costs and the adverse effects of \nclimate change and natural disasters, and remaining particularly concerned that many \nsmall island developing States have not achieved sustained high levels of economic \ngrowth, owing in part to their vulnerabilities to the ongoing negative impacts of \nenvironmental challenges and external economic and financial shocks,  \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety \nand well-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as \nthe severe disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives \nand livelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the \npandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals by designing and implementing sustainable and inclusive \nrecovery strategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build \nresilience to future shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health \nsystems and achieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and \ntimely access for all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, \ntherapeutics and diagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, \nsolidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one \nbehind, \n \nAcknowledging the severe consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the \nsustainable development of small island developing States envisioned in the Samoa \nPathway and the 2030 Agenda, including the far-reaching and enduring consequences \nfor poverty eradication, employment, growth and social welfare as a result of the \nunprecedented contraction of their economies, and noting with concern that the \nexternal debt stocks of small island developing States have increased by 70 \npercentage points since 2009, resulting in the average rate of external debt to gross \ndomestic product in those States rising by 11 percentage points to 61.7 per cent in \n2019, while the ability of those States to self-insure against exogenous shocks \ncontinues to deteriorate further, highlighting that achieving the Goals and targets set \nout in the 2030 Agenda will be more difficult and that integrating the concept of \nresilience is critical to enable a sustainable future and avoid creating new risks,  \n \nAcknowledging also the need for urgent action to address the adverse impacts \nof climate change, including those related to sea level rise and extreme weather \nevents, which continue to pose a significant risk to small island developing States and \nto their efforts to achieve sustainable development and, for many, represent the \ngravest of threats to their survival and viability, including, for some, through loss of \nterritory, as well as through threats to water availability and food security and \nnutrition,  \n \nTaking note with concern of the findings contained in the
