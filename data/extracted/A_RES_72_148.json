\n \nmeeting of the General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous \nPeoples,8 and recalling other instruments, as appropriate, such as the United Nations \nDeclaration on the Right to Development,9 \n \nWelcoming the adoption of the outcome document of the United Nations summit \nfor the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, entitled \u201cTransforming our \nworld: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d,10 and the Addis Ababa Action \nAgenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, 11 \n \nRecalling that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development addresses the need \nto achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, in order to \nensure that no one is left behind, and that the systematic mainstreaming of a gender \nperspective in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda is crucial, \n \nTaking note of the Secretary-General\u2019s High-level Panel on Women\u2019s Economic \nEmpowerment, \n \nRecognizing that rural women and, where applicable, girls are critical agents in \npoverty and hunger reduction, that they are crucial to achieving food security and \nimproved nutrition in poor and vulnerable households and to environmental \nsustainability and that, in other ways, they are also critical to the achievement of all \nof the Sustainable Development Goals, \n \nRecognizing also that progress on the achievement of gender equality and the \nempowerment of women and girls, in particular in rural areas, has been held back \nowing to the persistence of historical and structural unequal power relations between \nwomen and men, poverty and inequalities and disadvantages in access to resources \nand opportunities that limit women\u2019s and girls\u2019 capabilities, and growing gaps in \nequality of opportunity, discriminatory laws, policies, social norms, attitudes, harmful \ncustomary and contemporary practices and gender stereotypes, \n \nExpressing its deep concern that discrimination and violence against women and \ngirls, including those in rural areas, continue to occur in all parts of the world and \nthat all forms of violence against women and girls are impediments to the \ndevelopment of their full potential as equal partners with men and boys in all aspects \nof life, as well as obstacles to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, \n \nExpressing its deep concern also that, while women contribute more than \n50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they account for 70 per cent of the \nworld\u2019s hungry, and that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, \nfood insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination,  \n \nExpressing concern that many rural women continue to be economically and \nsocially disadvantaged because of their limited access to economic resources and \nopportunities and their limited access or lack of access to quality education, health-\ncare services, justice, land, sustainable and time- and labour-saving infrastructure and \ntechnology, water and sanitation and other resources, as well as to credit, extension \nservices and agricultural inputs, and expressing concern also about their exclusion \nfrom planning and decision-making and their disproportionate share of unpaid care \nand domestic work, \n \nEmphasizing that rural women\u2019s poverty is directly related to the absence of \neconomic opportunities and autonomy and the lack of access to economic and \nproductive resources, quality education and support services and of women\u2019s \nparticipation in the decision-making process, and recognizing that rural women\u2019s \n__________________ \n \n8  Resolution 69/2. \n \n9  Resolution 41/128, annex. \n \n10

for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems, 13 endorsed \nby the Committee on World Food Security, which embrace gender equality as one of \nthe main guiding principles of implementation in order to help to address the ongoing \ndisparities with regard to access to and control of land and other natural resources, \n \nDeeply concerned that climate change poses a challenge to poverty eradication \nand the achievement of sustainable development, threatens food security and \nincreases the risks of famine, and that rural women and girls, especially in developing \ncountries, are disproportionately affected by the impacts of desertification, \ndeforestation, sand and dust storms, natural disasters, persistent drought, extreme \nweather events, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, \n \nRecognizing that women and girls in rural areas may be particularly vulnerable \nto violence because of multidimensional poverty and lack of access to social care and \nprotection services and, as applicable, employment opportunities, as well as negative \nsocial norms, \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General;14  \n \n2. \nUrges
