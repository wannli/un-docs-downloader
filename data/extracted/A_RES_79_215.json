governance reform at both the \nFund and the World Bank to adapt to changes in the global economy,  \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety \nand well-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as \nthe severe disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives \nand livelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the \npandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals by designing and implementing sustainable and inclusive \nrecovery strategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build \nresilience to future shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health \nsystems and achieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and \ntimely access for all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, \ntherapeutics and diagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, \nsolidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one \nbehind,  \n \nRecognizing that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals is intrinsically \nlinked to the successful implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, \nemphasizing that additional and timely financing is essential to reach the Goals by \n2030, and in this regard stressing the urgent need for the adequate mobilization of \nresources,  \n \nNoting with concern that the total external debt of developing countries reached \na record level of 11.4 trillion United States dollars in 2023, an increase of 3.4 per \ncent, and deeply concerned that 3.3 billion people live in developing countries that \nspend more on interest payments than on either education or health, limiting further \ncountries\u2019 abilities to invest in sustainable development and the implementation of \nthe 2030 Agenda,  \n \nConcerned that more countries have been paying International Monetary Fund \nsurcharges, which add extra costs for precisely those countries that face the most \nsevere balance of payment challenges, \n \nRecognizing the need to help developing countries to bridge financing gaps, \nincluding when it comes to disparities in financial costs and in access to technologies \nto fully achieve a digital transition, stressing that the financing needs of developing \ncountries remain very high, and calling for the reform of the international financial \narchitecture, \n \nConcerned about the multiple interrelated and mutually exacerbating current \nglobal crises, in particular the world financial and economic crisis, volatile energy \nand commodity prices, the food crisis and the challenges posed by climate change, \nwhich have a negative impact on the development prospects of developing countries \nand threaten to further widen the gap between developed and developing countries, \nincluding the technological and income gap, and which could further undermine the \nachievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the \nSustainable Development Goals,  \n \nConcerned also, in this regard, that the proportion of workers living in extreme \npoverty, including workers in the informal economy, continues to increase, as does \nthe proportion of the population living on less than 1.90 dollars a day, and that \nprogress towards ending extreme poverty has been reversed by three to four years at \nthe global level, \n \nConcerned further about recent economic developments in the context of the \ncontinued challenges to achieving sustained economic growth, in which persistently \nhigh levels of inequality pose a challenge to robust growth and sustainable \n\nA/RES/79/215 \nTowards a New International Economic Order\n \n24-24341\n4/7 \n \ndevelopment, declining private investment in infrastructure highlights the obstacles \nto bridging the infrastructure financing gap and advancing the long-term financing of \nsustainable development, emerging debt challenges and vulnerabilities have \nintensified across developing countries, global exchange rate volatility has intensified \nand global inflationary trends have diverged, and that the weak prospects for the \nglobal economy put at risk vital public investment in education, health and action on \nclimate change, as well as progress in poverty eradication, especially in developing \ncountries,  \n \nConcerned that billions of the world\u2019s citizens continue to live in poverty and \nare denied a life of dignity and that there are rising inequalities within and among \ncountries and enormous disparities of opportunity, wealth and power,  \n \nStressing the lack of strong coordinated international response in dealing with \nthe challenges referred to above, illustrating that the calls made in the Declaration \nand the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic \nOrder are still highly relevant,  \n \nUnderlining the need for a more sustainable economic growth and recovery, and \nrecognizing that this goal can be achieved through inclusive multilateralism and the \nequal participation of all countries, as envisioned, inter alia, in the Declaration and \nthe Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic \nOrder,  \n \nRecognizing that innovative and enhanced approaches to financing for \ndevelopment are needed to address the challenges posed by the current global \neconomic situation, poverty and the achievement of the internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, and stressing that \nthese approaches should neither be a substitute for nor negatively affect the level of \ntraditional sources of development financing, including official development \nassistance and concessional finance, and that they need to be developed in a spirit of \npartnership, cooperation and solidarity, bearing in mind the common interests and \nnational priorities of each country,  \n \nNoting with regret that, 50 years later, many relevant aspects of the Programme \nof Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order have not been \nimplemented and that, consequently, many developing countries continue to face \nsignificant challenges to their development prospects, including vulnerability to \nexternal shocks and lack of adequate representation in global economic governance,  \n \nRecognizing the role played by regional, subregional and interregional \ncooperation as well as regional economic integration, based on equality of \npartnership, in strengthening international cooperation with the objective of \nfacilitating economic coordination and cooperation for development, the achievement \nof development goals and the sharing of best practices and knowledge,  \n \nRecognizing also that widespread financial deregulation has contributed to \nlarger net capital outflows from developing countries to developed countries,  \n \nNoting with deep concern the impact of illicit financial flows on the economic, \nsocial and political stability and development of developing countries, resulting in \nthe urgent need to adopt measures to combat them, which could enhance fiscal space \nfor Governments to finance the achievement of the 2030 Agenda,  \nStressing the need for policy space to allow for the formulation of national \ndevelopment strategies by developing countries, aimed at bringing prosperity for all, \n \nConcerned with the increasing protectionist measures and adoption of inward-\nlooking policies that undermine the multilateral trading system and increase the \n\nTowards a New International Economic Order \nA/RES/79/215\n \n5/7\n24-24341 \n \nvulnerabilities of developing countries, and emphasizing the importance of promoting \nan open world economy and generating greater positive effects of globalization,  \n \nEmphasizing that multilateralism, including a universal, rules-based, open, \ntransparent, predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral \ntrading system, is the most appropriate platform of international cooperation for \naddressing the challenges facing humanity,  \n \nConcerned about the financial risks associated with ongoing monetary policy \nadjustments in developed countries, which could induce instability in the international \nmonetary system, leading to exchange rate depreciation and unsustainable levels of \nexternal debt in many developing and emerging economies,  \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General;6  \n \n2. \nNotes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,7 the Addis Ababa \nAction Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development 8 \nand the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change 9  carry forward many of the ideas and recommendations of the \nDeclaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order 10 and the \nProgramme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order; 11  \n \n3. \nReaffirms the need to continue working towards a new international \neconomic order based on the principles of equity,

unilateral economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance with \ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations that impede the full \nachievement of economic and social development, particularly in developing \ncountries;  \n \n5. \nReaffirms that national development efforts need to be supported by an \nenabling international economic environment, including coherent and mutually \nsupporting world trade, monetary and financial systems and strengthened and \nenhanced global economic governance, as well as by respect for each country\u2019s policy \nspace; \n \n6. \nWelcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s call for a new Bretton Woods moment \nto place the dramatic needs of developing countries at the centre of every decision \nand mechanism of the global financial system;

fulfilment of the commitment to pursue policy coherence and \nan enabling environment for sustainable development at all levels and by all actors \nand to reinvigorate the Global Partnership for

\ncountries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States and middle-\nincome countries, as well as countries and peoples under foreign occupation, in \ninternational economic
