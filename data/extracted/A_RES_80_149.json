\nRecognizing that, as per capita income increases above low-income thresholds, \naccess to external public finance decreases and middle-income countries are \nincreasingly cut off from concessional finance, especially in the form of grants,  \n \nRecognizing also that the enhanced and revitalized Global Partnership for \nSustainable Development, led by Governments, will be a vehicle for strengthening \ninternational cooperation and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, while noting \nthat multi-stakeholder partnerships and the resources, knowledge and ingenuity of the \nprivate sector, civil society, the scientific community, academia, philanthropy and \nfoundations, parliaments, local authorities, volunteers and other stakeholders will be \nimportant in mobilizing and sharing knowledge, expertise, technology and financial \nresources, complementing the efforts of Governments and supporting the achievement \nof the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular in developing countries, \n \nRecalling that the most vulnerable countries and, in particular, African \ncountries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small \nisland developing States deserve special attention, as do countries in situations of \nconflict and post-conflict countries, and that there are also serious challenges within \nmany middle-income countries,  \n \nRecognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to development and that \ndevelopment cooperation by the United Nations development system should respond \nto the varying development needs of programme countries, including those of middle-\nincome countries, in a manner that addresses their specific challenges while mindful \nof their diversity, and recognizing also that revitalized, strategic, flexible and results- \nand action-oriented United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation \nFrameworks should be prepared and finalized in full consultation and agreement with \nnational Governments and aligned with national development plans, strategies and \ncircumstances in support of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda,  \n \nNoting that, over the past ten years, eight low-income countries have \ntransitioned to middle-income country status, and the middle-income country \ncategory currently comprises 104 countries, encompasses 73 per cent of the global \npopulation and accounts for 40 per cent of global economic output, \n \nNoting also that national averages based on criteria such as per capita income \ndo not always reflect the actual particularities and development needs of middle-\nincome countries and that, despite notable progress in reducing poverty levels in both \nabsolute and relative terms, poverty remains a problem in many middle-income \ncountries, as they are still home to 62 per cent of the world\u2019s people living in poverty,  \n \nRecognizing with concern that the prevalence of hunger and malnutrition has \nbeen increasing in many countries, exacerbated by the coronavirus disease \n(COVID\u201119) pandemic, including in middle-income countries, with most relying \nheavily on international trade in primary commodities,  \n \nRecognizing that inequality, or even a rise in inequality, remains pervasive in \nmiddle-income countries, even in those with high levels of economic growth, that \nfurther investments in social services, social protection systems, decent work \nopportunities and economic opportunities are needed in order to reduce inequalities \nand that economic growth needs to be sustained, inclusive and equitable,  \n \nStressing that middle-income countries continue to face a set of common \nstructural barriers that hamper further economic transformation, and challenges \nrelated to, inter alia, job creation, natural resource management, reliance on primary \ncommodity exports, the adverse effects of disaster risks and climate change, high \n\nDevelopment cooperation with middle-income countries \nA/RES/80/149\n \n5/10\n25-20771 \n \nlevels of external debt and the volatility of exchange rates and capital flows, and, in \nthis regard, efforts to create a national enabling environment for development should \nbe complemented by an international enabling environment, \n \nStressing also the importance for middle-income countries of having access to, \nand development of, better technologies, research and innovation and better \nmanagement practices, which can foster skills development, boost productivity and \nachieve sustainable and inclusive growth,  \n \nRecognizing that connectivity through quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient \ninfrastructure, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all, contributes to \nthe sustainable development of middle-income countries,  \n \nRecalling that, for all countries, public policies and the mobilization and \neffective use of domestic resources, underscored by the principle of national \nownership, are central to our common pursuit of sustainable development, including \nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals, \n \nRecalling also the resolve of Member States to enhance and strengthen domestic \nresource mobilization and fiscal space, including, where appropriate, through \nmodernized tax systems, more efficient tax collection, the broadening of the tax base \nand the effective combating of tax evasion and capital flight, and reiterating that, \nwhile each country is responsible for its tax system, it is important to support national \nefforts in these areas by strengthening technical assistance and enhancing \ninternational cooperation and participation in addressing international tax matters,  \n \nRecalling further the importance of international support, in various forms, \nincluding North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation, that is well aligned \nwith national priorities to contribute to addressing the development needs of middle-\nincome countries, including through capacity-building,  \n \nRecognizing the need to better understand the multidimensional nature of \ndevelopment and poverty, and acknowledging the significant role that the United \nNations system has played and should continue to play in this regard, including the \nanalytical and technical support provided by the Department of Economic and Social \nAffairs of the Secretariat, \n \nRecognizing also the growing political momentum for measuring progress in \nsustainable development using metrics that complement or go beyond gross domestic \nproduct, including multidimensional vulnerability, given the broader recognition that \nrelying solely on economic or income-based indicators such as gross domestic product \nand gross national income fails to capture the full complexity of countries\u2019 \ndevelopment realities, structural vulnerabilities and needs, and noting ongoing efforts \nto identify and promote the use of measures of progress on sustainable development \nthat complement or go beyond gross domestic product, including the Beyond GDP \nGlobal Alliance created under the Sevilla Platform for Action,  \n \nExpressing concern that climate change is adversely affecting productivity in \nevery country, in particular developing countries, including middle-income countries, \nas extreme weather shocks directly affect productivity through the destruction of \ninfrastructure and labour force displacement, and that a number of middle-income \ncountries have sizeable sectors that are exposed to climate change, such as agriculture, \nconstruction, mining, tourism and transport,  \n \nReaffirming that achieving gender equality, the empowerment of all women and \ngirls and the full realization of their human rights are essential to achieving sustained, \ninclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development, and in that \nregard reiterating the need for gender mainstreaming, including targeted actions and \ninvestments in the formulation and implementation of all financial, economic, \n\nA/RES/80/149 \nDevelopment cooperation with middle-income countries\n \n25-20771\n6/10 \n \nenvironmental and social policies, and recalling the call of the Sevilla Commitment 8 \nto promote gender-responsive solutions across the financing for development agenda, \ninvestment in the care economy and the full participation of women and girls in \nsustainable development processes,  \n \nNoting with concern that public debt burdens have increased in many middle-\nincome countries, with the median debt-to-gross domestic product ratio reaching 54.8 \nper cent, up from 53.7 per cent in 2023, and, while this remained below the 2020 \npeak, higher interest expenditures pose a growing risk to debt sustainability,  \n \nReiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind, reaffirming the \nrecognition that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, and the wish to see \nthe Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society, \nand recommitting to endeavour to reach the furthest behind first,  \n \nWelcoming the political declarations of the high-level meetings on health \nconvened by the General Assembly during the seventy-eighth session9 as efforts to \nhighlight the importance of health in the high-level political agenda,  \n \nWelcoming also the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to address the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal financing gap through a Sustainable Development Goal stimulus, \n \nNoting with concern that the COVID\u201119 pandemic, apart from creating an \nunprecedented global public health crisis and affecting the most vulnerable \npopulations, has had a devastating effect on the economies of middle-income \ncountries, including those moving into higher income, through the introduction of \nlockdowns and suspensions of economic activity leading to rising extreme poverty \nand food insecurity, gender inequality, unprecedented job losses, disruptions in \nregional and global production chains and stagnating international trade, excessive \nvolatility of commodity prices, shrinking remittances and numerous other channels, a \ndecline in global foreign direct investment, the sharp contraction in the already \nlimited fiscal space and the bleak economic outlook that has suppressed investment, \nundermining future growth prospects and long-term productivity trends,  \n \nRecalling the resolve to redouble our efforts to reduce remittance costs to less \nthan 3 per cent of amounts transferred by 2030, \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General;10 \n \n2. \nAcknowledges the efforts made and successes achieved by many middle-\nincome countries in eradicating poverty and achieving the internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals, as well as their significant contribution to global and regional \ndevelopment and economic stability;  \n \n3. \nAlso acknowledges that identifying structural gaps can improve the \nunderstanding of development needs of developing countries, including middle-\nincome countries;  \n \n4. \nUnderlines that, for many middle-income countries, official development \nassistance, including financing on concessional terms from different multilateral \nfinancial institutions, remains important;  \n \n5. \nAlso underlines the need for sustained efforts towards achieving debt \nsustainability in middle-income countries in order to avoid a debt crisis, and the \nimportance of debt restructurings being timely, orderly, effective, fair and negotiated \nin good faith;  \n_______________ \n \n8 Resolution 79/323, annex. \n \n9 Resolution 78/3, annex, resolution 78/4, annex, and resolution 78/5, annex. \n \n10 A/80/418. \n\nDevelopment cooperation with middle-income countries \nA/RES/80/149\n \n7/10\n25-20771 \n \n \n6. \nCalls for improved international debt mechanisms to support debt review, \ndebt payment suspensions and debt restructuring, as appropriate, with an expansion \nof support and eligibility to vulnerable countries in need, commits to continuing to \nassist developing countries in avoiding a build-up of unsustainable debt and in \nimplementing resilience measures so as to reduce the risk of relapsing into another \ndebt crisis, recognizes the importance of new and emerging challenges and \nvulnerabilities in regard to developing country external and domestic debt \nsustainability, and calls for strengthened multilateral actions and coordination by all \ncreditors to address the deteriorating debt situation, noting that, while there has been \nsome progress in reforming the sovereign debt architecture, there is significant room \nfor improvements;  \n \n7. \nRecognizes that, with 62 per cent of the world\u2019s poor population \nconcentrated in middle-income countries, development cooperation, policy dialogue \nand partnerships with those countries can contribute to the achievement of the \ninternationally agreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development \nGoals and targets;  \n \n8. \nWelcomes the solidarity of middle-income countries with other developing \ncountries, in particular the financial, technical, technology transfer on mutually \nagreed terms and capacity-building support being provided by middle-income \ncountries, particularly to the least developed countries, including through South-\nSouth and triangular cooperation, while stressing that South-South cooperation is a \ncomplement to, and not a substitute for, North-South cooperation, and in this regard \ncalls upon the United Nations development system to continue its ongoing efforts to \nmainstream support to South-South cooperation and triangular cooperation;  \n \n9. \nAlso welcomes the outcome document of the second High-level United \nNations Conference on South-South Cooperation, held in Buenos Aires from 20 to \n22 March 2019, 11  and notes decisions 22/1 and 22/2 adopted by the High-level \nCommittee on South-South Cooperation at its twenty-second session, held from 27 to \n30 May 2025;12 \n \n10. Recalls that the creation, development and diffusion of new innovations \nand technologies and associated know-how, including the transfer of technology on \nmutually agreed terms, are powerful drivers of economic growth and sustainable \ndevelopment; \n \n11. \nRequests the United Nations development system to ensure that it \naddresses the diverse development needs of middle-income countries in a coordinated \nmanner through, inter alia, an accurate assessment of the national priorities and needs \nof these countries, taking into account the use of variables that go beyond per capita \nincome criteria;  \n \n12. Reaffirms the political commitment to fully and timely implement the \ncommitments contained in resolution 79/1 to establish measures of progress on \nsustainable development that complement or go beyond gross domestic product to \nhave a more inclusive approach to international cooperation, including in the \nconsideration of informing access to development finance and technical cooperation, \nwelcomes the establishment of an independent high-level expert group to develop \nrecommendations for a limited number of country-owned and universally applicable \nindicators of sustainable development that complement and go beyond gross domestic \n_______________ \n \n11 Resolution 73/291, annex. \n \n12 Official Records of the General Assembly, Eightieth Session, Supplement No. 39 (A/80/39), \nchap.
