resolutions related to the eradication of poverty,  \n \nReaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including \nextreme poverty, which is disproportionately high in rural areas, is the greatest global \nchallenge facing the world today and is an indispensable requirement for sustainable \ndevelopment, particularly in Africa, in the least developed countries, in landlocked \ndeveloping countries, in small island developing States and in some middle-income \ncountries, noting with concern that, as of 2023, approximately 691 million people still \nlived in extreme poverty and that the latest projections suggest that up to 89 million \nadditional people were living in extreme poverty in 2022 because of the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic and the precarious recovery, compounded by the \ncontinued global crisis of food, finance and challenge of energy access, and underlining \nthe importance of accelerating sustainable, inclusive and

share of the rural poor in the total population of those living in \npoverty rose by more than 2 percentage points between 2015 and 2018, which \nhighlights the setbacks and challenges in fighting rural poverty even before the \npandemic and the need for accelerated action towards the eradication of poverty, and \nrecognizing that addressing rural poverty is fundamental for the achievement of \nSustainable Development Goal 1 of the 2030 Agenda, as well as most of the other \nGoals, with 70 per cent of the targets requiring action in rural areas, \n \nEmphasizing that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on sustainable \ndevelopment have increased the number of people living in poverty around the world \nand disrupted, inter alia, the normal functioning of open markets, global supply chain \nconnectivity and the flow of essential goods, hindering the fight against poverty and \nadding urgency to the call to galvanize action and delivery for the eradication of \npoverty, in all its forms and dimensions, particularly in rural areas, where most of the \nextreme poor live, stressing that global inequities in access to COVID-19 vaccines, \nwith the bulk of vaccines disproportionately available in high-income countries, in \ncontrast with the low availability of COVID-19 vaccines in low-income countries, \nfurther put at risk the health of the rural poor, and in this regard welcoming the 2020, \n2021 and 2022 Sustainable Development Goals Moments, placing an emphasis on \npoverty and inequality, on climate change and a healthy planet and on achieving \ngender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, \n \nTaking note of the efforts of the President of the General Assembly at its \nseventy-fourth session to launch the Alliance for Poverty Eradication, which is timely \nand meaningful and continues to serve as a platform for the exchange of ideas, \npolicies and best practices on poverty eradication, and stressing the importance of \naddressing poverty, including rural poverty issues, in these forums, as the rural poor \nmight be less prepared to deal with the effects of and recover from the COVID-19 \npandemic and multiple crises and could have less access to adequate sanitation, food \nand nutrition, water, health-care services, education, the Internet, information and \ncommunications technology, social protection, financial services and public \ninfrastructure, \n \nCommending the efforts and remarkable progress achieved by developing \ncountries in eradicating rural poverty, while noting with concern that key gaps still \nremain, such as: a lack of adequate data; inadequate investment in agricultural and \nrural development; lower and inadequate human capital formation relevant for rural \nlivelihoods; inadequate income sources, including scarce non-farm income-\ngenerating opportunities; a lack of productive capacity and agricultural \ntransformation; persistent gender inequality; a lack of social protection; insufficient \nbasic infrastructure and services; a lack of or poor adaptive capacity and resilience to \ncope with the adverse effects of climate change and disasters; and a lack of effective \nrural institutions and of sufficient resources, \n \nRecognizing the leading role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations, together with other United Nations entities, including the \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development, the International Labour \nOrganization and the United Nations Development Programme, in the global efforts \nto reduce poverty, including rural poverty, while addressing other interlinked \nchallenges such as eliminating hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, \nand increasing the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises,  \n \nNoting with appreciation the aspirations, embedded in Agenda 2063 of the \nAfrican Union, to lift huge sections of the population out of poverty, improve incomes \nand catalyse economic and social transformation, and recognizing the importance of \nthe international community\u2019s helping African countries to achieve such goals, \nespecially in the rural areas of the African continent,  \n\nA/RES/78/165 \nEradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development\n \n23-25880\n4/9 \n \n \nNoting that, while considerable progress has been made over the past decade \nacross all areas of development, the pace of progress observed in recent years is \ninsufficient and uneven to fully meet the Sustainable Development Goals and targets \nby 2030, especially in the area of rural poverty eradication, \n \nRecognizing that poverty is a serious impediment to the achievement of gender \nequality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including those living in rural \nareas, and that the feminization of poverty persists, emphasizing that the eradication \nof poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is an \nindispensable requirement for sustainable development, acknowledging the mutually \nreinforcing links between the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment \nof all women and girls and the eradication of poverty, and stressing the importance of \nsupport for countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms and \ndimensions, \n \nEmphasizing that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda depends crucially on \nthe transformation of rural areas, where most of the poor and hungry live, and that, in \norder to eradicate rural poverty, investment should be encouraged in those sectors that \nhave a bigger impact, such as education and health, including school feeding \nprogrammes, social protection, agriculture and infrastructure, while noting the \nfinancing gap between resources dedicated to the education sector and the amount \nnecessary to reach Sustainable Development Goal 4, while the COVID-19 pandemic \nhas provoked an unprecedented learning crisis, and that at least 80 billion dollars in \nannual investment will be needed to meet the demand for food that is projected to \nincrease by 70 per cent by 2050, and that the investments that are needed for climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation also remain underfunded,  \n \nRecalling the proclamation of 2019\u20132028 as the United Nations Decade of \nFamily Farming, to raise the profile of the role of family farming 4 in contributing to \nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and reaffirming the importance of the United \nNations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016\u20132025) in the promotion of activities \ntowards the eradication of rural poverty,  \n \nRecognizing the interlinkages and integrated nature of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, and reiterating that the eradication of rural poverty and hunger \nis crucial for the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including \nthose contained in the 2030 Agenda, and that rural development should be pursued \nthrough an integrated approach that encompasses economic, social and environmental \ndimensions, takes into account a gender perspective and consists of mutually \nreinforcing policies and programmes, and that should be balanced, targeted, situation-\nspecific and locally owned, include local synergies and initiatives and be responsive \nto the needs of rural populations, \n \nRecalling that more than 80 per cent of the extreme poor live in rural areas and \nwork in agriculture and that the extreme poverty rate in rural areas is three times \nhigher than in urban areas, and recognizing that devoting resources to the \ndevelopment of rural areas and sustainable agriculture and supporting smallholder \nfarmers, especially women farmers, is key to ending poverty in all its forms and \ndimensions, by, inter alia, improving the welfare of farmers, \n \nTaking into consideration the increasing number of young people who decide to \nleave rural areas for more urbanized ones and the challenges that this trend poses to \nthe livelihood of rural families,  \n \nExpressing its concern that the extreme poor have limited access to productive \nresources, basic health, Internet and digital technologies, education and social \n__________________ \n \n4  Resolution 72/239. \n\nEradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable

impacts of natural hazards, \nespecially weather-related hazards, including the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, and the \nadverse effects of climate change, and that rural women and girls fare far worse on \nmost development indicators,  \n \nEmphasizing the importance of enhancing global support for national work on \nrural development policies and strategies, including on commodity production as well \nas increased public and private investments to upgrade productive capacity, and that \ntackling rural poverty requires integrated, cross-sectoral, multi-stakeholder and \ncontext-specific interventions, with a strong emphasis on sustainable food and \nagricultural systems for food security, and nutrition, economic growth, revitalization \nand development in rural areas, \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General5 and the recommendations \ncontained therein; \n \n2. \nReaffirms that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, \nincluding extreme poverty, for all people everywhere, is the greatest global challenge \nand an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, as well as an \noverarching objective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 6 of which \nthe Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing \nfor Development7 is an integral part, supporting and complementing it;  \n \n3. \nExpresses its deep concern that the progress in reducing poverty remains \nuneven, with 1.1 billion people still living in multidimensional poverty, 84 per cent \nof whom live in rural areas, and that this number continues to be significant and \nunacceptably high, whereas the levels of inequality in income, wealth and \nopportunities remain high or are increasing in a number of countries, and the \nnon-income dimensions of poverty and deprivation, such as access to inclusive and \nequitable quality education or basic health services, and relative poverty remain major \nconcerns, and stresses the importance of national and global efforts to create the \nconditions for achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions, economic, \nsocial and environmental, sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, \nshared prosperity and decent work for all in society, taking into account different \nlevels of national development capacities;  \n \n4. \nRecognizes the importance of promoting socioeconomic development in \nrural areas as an effective strategy and important means at the global level for the \neradication of poverty, including extreme poverty, and therefore underlines the \nimportance of shaping a rural poverty eradication pattern with the concerted efforts \nof the whole of society to promote socioeconomic development in rural areas and \ncreate sound policy frameworks at the local, national, regional and international levels \nbased on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies to support accelerated \ninvestment in poverty eradication action; \n \n5. \nEmphasizes that economic growth continues to leave rural dwellers \nbehind, that rural areas host a disproportionate share of people living in \nmultidimensional poverty and that comparable data from 110 countries reveal that \nAfrica and South Asia account for the highest number of multidimensionally poor \npeople, and recommends that countries promote dedicated and coordinated social, \neconomic, agricultural and rural development in their national policies, including by \nadopting rural-focused poverty eradication strategies in alignment with the 2030 \nAgenda, social policies aimed at improving human capital in rural areas and ensuring \n__________________ \n \n5  A/78/238. \n \n6  Resolution 70/1. \n \n7  Resolution 69/313, annex. \n\nA/RES/78/165

\nagricultural productivity, and rural development policies aimed at improving access \nto rural infrastructure and basic services of high quality and at boosting non-farm \nemployment opportunities;  \n \n6. \nRecognizes the critical role and contribution of rural women, including \nsmallholders and women farmers, fishers, Indigenous women and their traditional \nknowledge and women in local communities, in enhancing agricultural and rural \ndevelopment, improving food security and nutrition and eradicating rural poverty, and \ntherefore highlights the importance of promoting their economic empowerment, their \nfull access to land ownership and decent work and economic opportunities and their \nparticipation in decision-making;  \n \n7. \nStresses the importance of establishing and implementing targeted policies \nand measures to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme \npoverty, by formulating rural development strategies with clear poverty eradication \ngoals, strengthening national statistical capacity and monitoring systems, including \ninnovative use of telephone surveys and high-resolution data facilitated by remote \nsensing, and implementing nationally appropriate social protection systems and \nmeasures for all, and taking concrete actions to prevent the return to poverty, \nespecially when the past three years have witnessed a sharp setback in poverty \nreduction, with a view to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions, \neconomic, social and environmental, and building the resilience of the poor and those \nin vulnerable situations;  \n \n8. \nEncourages all countries and other relevant stakeholders to promote \ninclusive economic transformation in rural areas that increases productivity and \ncontributes to bridging the present rural-urban divide while ensuring productive \nemployment and decent work, access to reliable and appropriate social protection \nsystems, inclusive and equitable quality education, health-care services, quality, \nresilient and sustainable infrastructure, roads and telecommunications, as well as \npreparedness planning for crises and early warning, reiterates that the COVID-19 \npandemic has highlighted the important role of digital connectivity and access and \nthe potential of e-commerce and e-learning solutions for poverty eradication, and thus \ncalls upon all stakeholders to strengthen digital, information and communications \ntechnology, science, technology and innovation cooperation on mutually agreed \nterms, especially in the area of e-commerce, financial technology (fintech), affordable \nand reliable Internet connectivity and digital infrastructure investment and \nconstruction to keep food and agriculture supply chains functioning and achieve \nmomentum under the 2030 Agenda for an inclusive, sustainable and resilient recovery \nfor global development, putting people at the centre of the response, protecting our \nplanet and achieving prosperity, with no one left behind, in line with the 2030 Agenda;  \n \n9. \nRecognizes that eradicating poverty in rural areas cannot be separated from \nthe sustainable transformation and strengthening of food systems and that ensuring \nfair markets that enable the participation of smallholder and family farmers in food \nsystems, particularly in value chains where small-scale producers have a comparative \nadvantage, will continue to be important, in this regard takes note with appreciation \nof the United Nations Food Systems Summit, held in 2021, which recognized the \ntransformative effects of sustainable food systems as a driver for the achievement of \nthe Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, underscores that promoting a universal, \nrules-based, open, transparent, predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and \nequitable multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization is essential \nfor building sustainable, inclusive and resilient food systems, and thus stresses the \nimportance of keeping trade channels and markets open, equitable, transparent, non-\ndiscriminatory and predictable for the movement of food, fertilizer and other \nagricultural inputs and outputs and access to energy, and emphasizes the urgent need \n\nEradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development \nA/RES/78/165\n \n7/9\n23-25880 \n \nto combat protectionism in all its forms and to correct and prevent trade restrictions \nand distortions that are inconsistent with World Trade Organization rules in world \nagricultural markets;  \n \n10. Notes with great concern that the poorest population spends a larger share \nof income on food, which means extreme food price volatility can have devastating \nimpacts, and is a driver of increased poverty, particularly in rural areas; \n \n11. \nCalls upon all countries to promote agricultural and rural development in \ntheir national policies and renew their efforts to promote innovative approaches, \nincluding agroecology, among other approaches, to enhance capacity for food \nproduction, distribution and storage, cooperate in the relevant areas of science, \nresearch, technology and innovation, as appropriate and consistent with national \npolicies and frameworks, to strengthen sustainable agrifood systems that enhance \nfood security and nutrition, including sustainable productivity growth, significantly \nreducing food loss and waste, and strengthen policies that support small-scale \nproducers in engaging in agrifood system value chains; \n \n12. Recognizes the importance of employment for pro-poor growth in rural \nareas, and encourages the United Nations system and development partners to assist \ncountries, upon their request, in mainstreaming employment into investment policy \nand poverty reduction strategies, including those focused on rural area development, \nand fostering rapid agricultural productivity growth, especially in developing \ncountries, by increasing investment in agricultural and related rural off-farm activities \nand strengthening capacity-building for agricultural producers;  \n \n13. Also recognizes the essential role of inclusive and sustainable industrial \ndevelopment, which can diversify income opportunities as part of a comprehensive \nstrategy of structural economic transformation in eradicating poverty in all its forms \nand dimensions, especially in rural areas, supporting inclusive, sustained and \nsustainable economic growth, and thus in contributing to achieving sustainable \ndevelopment in developing countries, and calls upon international industrial \ncooperation to advance inclusive and sustainable industrialization and innovation and \nhelp developing countries to improve industrial production capacity;  \n \n14. Further recognizes the need to design, implement and pursue gender-\nresponsive economic and social policies aimed at, inter alia, eradicating poverty, \nincluding in rural areas, and combating the feminization of poverty, ensuring the full \nand equal participation of rural women in the development, implementation and \nfollow-up of development policies and programmes and poverty eradication \nstrategies, supporting increased rural employment and decent work and the \nredistribution of unpaid domestic and care work, and promoting the full, equal and \nmeaningful participation and leadership of women at all levels and sectors of the rural \neconomy and in diverse on-farm and off-farm economic activities, including \nsustainable agricultural and fisheries production; \n \n15. Encourages Member States, international organizations, the private sector \nand other partners to develop programmes to foster the creation of decent work in \nrural areas and increase the investment in agricultural and related off-farm activities, \nespecially for young people, including through economic diversification in rural \nareas, the promotion of sustainable agrifood systems and a balanced territorial \napproach, along a continuum that includes intermediate settlements and cities nested \namid agricultural zones, with varying levels of agglomeration, as a key to reducing \nrural poverty and persistent inequalities between urban, peri-urban and rural areas;  \n \n16. Emphasizes that, globally, 1.4 billion people, primarily in rural areas in \ndeveloping countries, do not have access to formal financial products and services, \n\nA/RES/78/165 \nEradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development\n \n23-25880\n8/9 \n \nand encourages further efforts of the international community to offer affordable ways \nto access finance for the financially excluded in rural areas; \n \n17. Also emphasizes the need to increase investment, including through \nenhanced international cooperation, in quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient rural \ninfrastructure, especially in roads, water, sanitation, electricity and Internet \nconnectivity, and to provide an inclusive and sustainable digital transformation;  \n \n18. Expresses its commitment to raising public awareness to promote the \neradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, in \nall countries, to mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of all stakeholders, \nespecially the rural residents living in extreme poverty, to fight against poverty, to \npromoting their active participation in the design and implementation of programmes \nand policies that affect them, and to providing quality education for the rural poor, \nwith the aim of achieving the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals;  \n \n19. Reiterates the need for enhanced and expanded access on mutually agreed \nterms by developing countries to appropriate technologies that are pro-poor and raise \nproductivity, and underlines the need for measures to increase investment in \nagriculture, including modern technologies, as well as in natural resources \nmanagement and capacity-building of developing countries;  \n \n20. Stresses that the achievement of sustainable development and the \neradication of poverty also hinge on the ability and readiness of countries to \neffectively mobilize domestic resources, attract foreign direct investment, fulfil \nofficial development assistance commitments and use official development assistance \neffectively, and facilitate the transfer of technology to developing countries, on \nmutually agreed terms, and further stresses that the resolution of unsustainable debt \nsituations is critical for heavily indebted poor countries, while remittances have \nbecome a significant source of income and finance for receiving economies and their \ncontribution to the achievement of sustainable development;  \n \n21. Recognizes the importance of addressing the diverse needs of and \nchallenges faced by countries in special situations, in particular African countries, the \nleast developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island \ndeveloping States, as well as the specific challenges facing many middle-income \ncountries, and therefore requests the United Nations development system, the \ninternational financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders to \nensure that these diverse and specific development needs are appropriately considered \nand addressed, in a tailored fashion, in their relevant strategies and policies, with a \nview to promoting a coherent and comprehensive approach towards individual countries;  \n \n22. Realizes that bridging the digital divides will require strong commitment \nby all relevant stakeholders at the national and international levels, reiterates the \nimportance of investing in infrastructure for greater access to affordable technological \ndevices and services for rural populations, which includes leveraging technology-\nenabled financial services and financial technologies to promote financial inclusion, \nand encourages efforts by all relevant stakeholders, especially United Nations \nagencies, funds and programmes, in the spirit of win-win cooperation, to assist \ndeveloping countries in overcoming the digital divides and promoting the use of \ninformation and communications technologies to foster economic and social \ndevelopment, particularly in rural areas, with the aim of building a shared future for \nhumankind;  \n \n23. Recognizes the devastating impact of diseases on societies, and calls for \nmeasures by relevant United Nations bodies, in accordance with their respective \nmandates, and other stakeholders to make good use of their experience and \nadvantages to further help developing countries with the aim of improving rural \n\nEradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development \nA/RES/78/165\n \n9/9\n23-25880 \n \ndevelopment planning, including poverty eradication and multisectoral development \nactivities covering economic and social aspects, including a gender perspective;  \n \n24.
