A. \n\nIntensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate \nall forms of violence against women and girls \nA/RES/75/161\n \n3/10\n20-17298 \n \n \nRecognizing that women\u2019s poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their \nmarginalization resulting from their exclusion from social and economic policies and \nfrom the benefits of education and sustainable development, can place them at \nincreased risk of violence, and that violence against women and girls impedes the \nsocial and economic and therefore the sustainable development of communities and \nStates, as well as the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \nand other internationally agreed development goals, \n \nRecognizing also that violence against women and girls, including sexual \nharassment, is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between \nmen and women, seriously violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of all \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls and constitutes a major \nimpediment to their full, equal and effective participation in society, as well as \neconomic and political life, \n \nRecognizing further the special needs of women and girls living in areas affected \nby complex humanitarian emergencies and in areas affected by terrorism, and that \nglobal health threats, climate change, more frequent and intense natural disasters, \nconflicts, violent extremism as and when conducive to terrorism, and related \nhumanitarian crises and the forced displacement of people threaten to reverse much \nof the development progress made in recent decades and have particular negative \nimpacts on women and girls that need to be comprehensively assessed and addressed, \n \nRecognizing that the growing impact of violence against women and girls, \nincluding sexual harassment, in digital contexts, especially on social media, its \nimpunity and the lack of preventive measures and remedies underline the need for \naction by Member States, in partnership with relevant stakeholders, and that such \nviolence may include stalking, death threats and threats of sexual and gender-based \nviolence, as well as related trends against women and girls in digital contexts, such \nas trolling, cyberbullying and other forms of cyberharassment, including unwanted \nverbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature, with a view to discrediting women \nand girls and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, \n \nAlarmed by the fact that violence against women and girls, including gender-\nrelated killings of women and girls, also known as femicide in certain regions of the \nworld, which constitutes an extreme form of violence against women and girls, is \namong the least punished crimes, and recognizing the key role of the criminal justice \nsystem in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls, including \nin ending impunity for such crimes, \n \nGravely concerned that domestic violence, including intimate partner violence, \nremains the most prevalent and least visible form of violence against women of all \nsocial strata across the world, and emphasizing that such violence is a violation, abuse \nor impairment of the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and, \nas such, is unacceptable, \n \nStressing the need to fully engage men and boys as strategic partners and allies \nin achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and in \npreventing and eliminating all forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including \ndomestic violence and sexual harassment, \n \nRecognizing the critical contribution of family members in combating violence \nagainst women and girls, including domestic violence, and that in preventing such \nviolence the family can play an important role, \n \nDeeply concerned by the increased violence against women and girls around the \nworld, including domestic violence, as well as harmful practices, such as female \ngenital mutilation and child early and forced marriage, including in conflict-affected \n\nA/RES/75/161 \nIntensification of efforts

the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, \n \nTaking note of the response plans, policies and initiatives implemented by \nGovernments and civil society in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent \nviolence against women and girls, including sexual and gender-based violence, and \nfacilitate reporting thereon, and to ensure that all women and girls can lead lives free \nfrom violence, coercion, stigma and discrimination, including through the use of digital \ntechnologies, media, helplines or the mobilization of grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels \nand other service providers to help victims to find safe spaces and seek support, \n \nUnderscoring that, often, a lack of information and awareness, fear of reprisals, \npersisting impunity, all forms of discrimination, including structural discrimination, \ninsufficient recourse for victims of violence against women and girls, gender \nstereotypes and negative social norms, including when leading to shame or stigma, as \nwell as negative economic consequences, such as loss of livelihood or reduced \nincome, prevent many women and girls, as applicable, from reporting or acting as \nwitnesses and from seeking redress and justice for these crimes, \n \nAcknowledging the importance of combating trafficking in persons in order to \nprevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, and in this regard \nstressing the importance of the full and effective implementation of the Protocol to \nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, \nsupplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 16 \nas well as of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, 17 \n \nEmphasizing that the lack or inadequacy of documentation, research and data \non violence against women and girls, including disaggregated data, and on its \nprevalence, patterns and drivers, as well as on effective approaches to prevent and \nrespond to it impedes efforts to design and implement measures, including, where \nappropriate, policies and legislation, to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence \nagainst women and girls, \n \nStressing that States have the obligation, at all levels, to promote, protect and \nrespect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, \nand must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and hold to account \nthe perpetrators of all forms of violence against women and girls, eliminate impunity \nand provide for effective access to appropriate remedies for victims and survivors, \nand should ensure the protection of women and girls, including adequate enforcement \nof civil remedies, orders of protection and criminal sanctions, and the provision of \nshelters, psychosocial services, counselling, health-care and other types of support \nservices, in order to avoid revictimization, to promote an empowering environment, \nand that to do so contributes to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms by women and girls subjected to violence, \n \nEncouraging the removal of all barriers to women\u2019s access to justice and \nensuring that they all have access to information about their rights as well as effective \nlegal assistance so that they can make informed decisions regarding, inter alia, legal \nproceedings and issues relating to family law, and also ensuring that they have access \nto just and effective remedies for the harm that they have suffered, including formal \nand appropriate informal justice mechanisms, as provided for by national legislation \nand, where necessary, the adoption of national legislation, \n \nGravely concerned that impunity for violations and abuses against women \nhuman rights defenders persists owing to factors such as a lack of reporting, \ndocumentation, investigation and access to justice, social barriers and constraints with

evaluation of gender-responsive policies, \nregulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence \nagainst women and girls, \n \nDeeply concerned that the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \non the social and economic situation of women and girls and their access to education \nand essential health services, the increased demand for paid and unpaid care work and \nthe reported surge of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence \nand violence in digital contexts, during confinement, are deepening already existing \ninequalities and risk reversing the progress in achieving gender equality and the \nempowerment of women and girls made in recent decades, \n \n1. \nStrongly condemns all forms of violence against all women and girls, \nrecognizing that they are an impediment to the achievement of gender equality and the \nempowerment of all women and girls and to the full realization of their human rights; \n \n2. \nStresses that \u201cviolence against women\u201d means any act of gender-based \nviolence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or \neconomic harm or

against women, as set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of \nViolence against Women; \n \n4. \nCalls upon States to address discrimination based on multiple and \nintersecting factors, which
