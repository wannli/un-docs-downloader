growing inequality, inequity and lack of access to resources and income-\nearning opportunities, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the effects of \nclimate change, biodiversity loss, and disasters, conflicts and geopolitical tensions, \nand remaining concerned that excessively volatile food prices can pose a serious \nchallenge to the fight against poverty and hunger and to the

noting the importance of working towards eliminating all \nforms of protectionism,  \n \nAcknowledging the importance of promoting sustainable farming and \nagriculture, which will contribute to sustainable food production systems and the \nconservation of biodiversity and ecosystems and help to eradicate hunger and \nmalnutrition, calling upon Member States to ensure that areas under

cognitive \ndevelopment, as well as an important principle of healthy diets, including through \ncontinued breastfeeding until 2 years of age and beyond combined with appropriate \nnutritious complementary feeding, and highlighting that despite the steady progress \nmade with regard to exclusive breastfeeding, with 47.7 per cent of infants under \n6 months of age exclusively breastfed worldwide in 2021, immense efforts will be \nrequired to meet the global nutrition targets of the 2030 Agenda and that even this \nindicator requires accelerated progress,  \n \nTaking note of the

\nRemaining deeply concerned that, according to the most recent estimates of the \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for \nAgricultural Development, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the World Food \nProgramme and the World Health Organization, between 691 million and 783 million \npeople faced hunger in 2022, considering the mid-range (about 735 million), \n122 million more people faced hunger in 2022 than in 2019, before the COVID-19 \npandemic, and that global nutrition challenges are increasingly complex as multiple \nforms of malnutrition, including stunting, wasting, underweight, micronutrient \ndeficiencies, overweight and obesity, may coexist within the same country or \nhousehold, with more than 3.1 billion people in the world \u2013 or 42 per cent \u2013 unable \nto afford a healthy diet in 2021,29  \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety \nand well-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as \nthe severe disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives \nand livelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the \npandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals by designing and implementing sustainable and inclusive \nrecovery strategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build \nresilience to future shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health \nsystems and achieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and \ntimely access for all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, \ntherapeutics and diagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, \nsolidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one \nbehind,  \n \nRecognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic, its impacts and the extraordinary \nmeasures adopted to combat it have delivered one of the most devastating blows to \nglobal food security and nutrition in recent times, with a disproportionate impact on \nwomen and children, and deeply concerned about the assessment that almost \n600 million people are projected to be chronically undernourished in 2030, pointing \nto the immense challenge of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal target to \neradicate hunger,  \n \nRecognizing also that economic downturns, gender inequalities, conflicts, \nbiodiversity loss, drought and the adverse effects of climate change, including more \nfrequent and extreme weather events, are among the key factors contributing to a \nreversal in the long-term progress in fighting global hunger, making the prospect of \nending hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 more difficult,  \n \nNoting that increasing urbanization, with almost 7 in 10 people projected to live \nin cities by 2050, is driving changes in agrifood systems across the rural-urban \ncontinuum, that these changes represent both challenges and opportunities to ending \nhunger, food insecurity and malnutrition and ensuring that everyone has access to \naffordable healthy diets, and that moderate or severe food insecurity affected 33.3 per \ncent of adults living in rural areas in 2022 compared with 28.8 per cent in peri-urban \nareas and 26.0 per cent in urban areas,30  \n \nNoting with concern the rise of food and agricultural input

of obese adults in the world, \nwith prevalence at 13.1 per cent in 2016, and that 37 million children under 5 years \nof age (5.6 per cent) were overweight in 2021,  \n \nExpressing concern that, according to the publication entitled 2023 Global \nReport on Food Crises: Joint Analysis for Better Decisions \u2013 Midyear Update, about \n238 million people face crisis-level food insecurity or
