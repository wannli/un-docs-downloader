Multidimensional vulnerability index \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecalling its resolutions 75/215 of 21 December 2020, 76/203 of 17 December \n2021, 77/245 of 30 December 2022 and 78/232 of 22 December 2023, \n \nRecognizing that sustainable development is multidimensional and affected by \nmultiple, intersecting, exogenous and endogenous factors, and that vulnerability to \nadverse exogenous shocks and stressors poses risks for sustainable development, \n \nRecognizing also that income-based measures may not fully reflect all \ndevelopment realities, vulnerabilities and challenges, \n \nHighlighting the need to strengthen the capacity of national statistical systems \nand provide financial and technical support to improve data collection and statistical \nanalysis in developing countries, \n \nNoting the lack of a universally accepted, international quantitative benchmark \nto measure exogenous structural vulnerability and lack of resilience to exogenous \nshocks across multiple dimensions of sustainable development at the national level \nthat can be used to complement gross national income per capita, \n \nRecognizing that the Panel and its report were guided by the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral,1 including on multidimensionality, universality, exogeneity, availability and \nreadability, \n__________________ \n \n1  A/76/211 and A/76/211/Corr.1. \n\nA/RES/78/322 \nMultidimensional vulnerability index\n \n24-14710\n2/5 \n \n \nRecalling paragraph 10 of resolution 77/245, in which it, inter alia, supported \nthe proposed definitions for structural vulnerability and resilience and the two-level \nstructure outlined in the interim report of the High-level Panel on the Development \nof a Multidimensional Vulnerability Index for Small Island Developing States as the \nbasis for the Panel\u2019s continued work, guiding the selection of appropriate indicators \nto inform vulnerability across all sectors of sustainable development, the proposed \ngovernance structure and the development of the country vulnerability-resilience \nprofiles, \n \nNoting that the multidimensional vulnerability index, developed by the High-\nlevel Panel, has a two-tiered structure, comprising a universal-level quantitative \nassessment of structural vulnerability, understood as exposure to adverse external \nshocks and stressors and lack of resilience, and vulnerability-resilience country \nprofiles, which can provide a more detailed, tailored and individualized \ncharacterization of a country\u2019s structural and non-structural vulnerability and \nresilience, \n \nRecognizing that the multidimensional vulnerability index does not address \nendogenous factors, \n \nNoting the importance of upholding data ownership, integrity, reliability, \naccuracy and simplicity in the multidimensional vulnerability index, \n \nNoting also the Panel\u2019s finding of a weak correlation between income level and \nboth vulnerability and lack of resilience, and that even for some countries that have \nsufficient resources to invest in resilience-building and may reach high-income status, \ntheir vulnerability remains a threat to their sustainable development, and the \nimportance of measuring and addressing vulnerability even within developing \ncountries with a relatively high national income, \n \nNoting further the Panel\u2019s finding that it is difficult to establish any vulnerability \nthreshold or cutoff analogous to income cutoffs, \n \nNoting that the multidimensional vulnerability index provides an assessment of \nvulnerability by measuring the risk of harm from exposure to adverse external \n(exogenous) shocks and stressors, was designed to reflect structural challenges, and \nis not a general measure of development or policy performance, \n \nAcknowledging the various indices produced by the United Nations, including \nthose developed by the Committee for Development Policy, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme and the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment, \n \nAcknowledging also that the multidimensional vulnerability index is a living \ntool that is a complement to, and not a substitute for, existing indices and metrics, and \nthat it can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of development \nrealities,  \n \nRecognizing the potential to further improve the multidimensional vulnerability \nindex, inter alia, by considering additional indicators to be included in future \niterations of the index as well as indicators for potential refinement or removal, to \neffectively capture the vulnerabilities of all developing countries, \n \nRecognizing also that the multidimensional vulnerability index may inform \nfuture initiatives that go beyond gross domestic product, \n \n\nMultidimensional vulnerability index \nA/RES/78/322\n \n3/5\n24-14710 \n \nFinal report \n \n \n1. \nWelcomes the work of the \u201cHigh-level Panel on the Development of a \nMultidimensional Vulnerability Index for Small Island Developing States\u201d, takes note \nof its final report, and decides to advance the multidimensional vulnerability index; \n \nScope \n \n \n2. \nNotes that, although initially proposed by small island developing States, \nthe multidimensional vulnerability index aims to capture exogenous vulnerabilities \nand lack of resilience to exogenous shocks of all developing countries, so as to ensure \ncredibility and comparability, under the guidance provided in the report of the \nSecretary-General; \n \nApplicability \n \n \n3. \nStresses that the use of the multidimensional vulnerability index is \nvoluntary, guided by the specific needs of the end user and informed by national \ncontexts; \n \n4. \nAlso stresses that the multidimensional vulnerability index should not be \nused directly or indirectly as a criterion to limit or hinder the ability of any developing \ncountry to access development cooperation, including through existing arrangements \nand practices; \n \n5. \nRequests the entities of the United Nations development system, within \ntheir respective mandates and where applicable, to consider using the \nmultidimensional vulnerability index, including the vulnerability-resilience country \nprofiles, in their relevant programmes of work and reporting, focusing on the \ncountries interested in its use, as a complement to existing measures; \n \n6. \nEncourages the entities of the United Nations development system to \ngather data and lessons learned on early implementation of the multidimensional \nvulnerability index and to share this information, with a view to improving the index; \n \n7. \nNotes the work of the international financial institutions, international \norganizations and multilateral development banks to consider structural vulnerability, \nand invites them to consider using the multidimensional vulnerability index, as \nappropriate, as a complement to their existing practices and policies, in line with their \nrespective mandates;  \n \n8. \nInvites development partners to explore using the multidimensional \nvulnerability index, as a complement to existing policies, to inform their development \ncooperation policies and practices, taking into account the priorities of those countries \ninterested in its use; \n \nCustodianship and governance \n \n \n9. \nDecides that the multidimensional vulnerability index will be maintained \nby: \n \n(a) \nA relevant existing United Nations entity, which will act as the secretariat \nof the multidimensional vulnerability index, and which will compute the index on a \nperiodic basis, and fulfil other duties and responsibilities necessary and appropriate \nfor the upkeep, maintenance, improvement of and reporting on the index, including \nthe provision of capacity-building support to Member States; \n \n(b) \nAn \nIndependent \nExpert \nAdvisory \nPanel, \nwhich \nwill \nprepare

concepts of structural vulnerability and lack of \nstructural resilience and their associated indicators, as well as new data; \n \n(c) \nThe Statistical Commission, which will provide technical reviews of \nfuture technical improvements to the multidimensional vulnerability index; \n \n10. Also decides that the secretariat of the multidimensional vulnerability \nindex will present a triennial report to the General Assembly, commencing at its \neightieth session, under the relevant agenda sub-item, on future improvements to the \nindex, informed by timely technical input and recommendations from the Independent \nExpert Advisory Panel and the Statistical Commission, respectively; \n \n11. \nFurther decides that the relevant existing United Nations entity, which will \nact as the secretariat of the multidimensional vulnerability index, and the members of \nthe Independent Expert Advisory Panel will be appointed by the Secretary-General, \nin consultation with Member States, by no later than the end of the seventy-ninth \nsession of the General Assembly; \n \n12. Decides that the Independent Expert Advisory Panel will: \n \n(a) \nComprise 15 independent experts, including a minimum of 5 from Member \nStates, who will serve in their personal capacity, without remuneration, with a good \nmix of expertise, who are to be drawn from the fields of economic development, social \ndevelopment and environmental protection, in order to avoid the need to engage the \nassistance of consultants and so as to reflect an adequate geographical and gender \nbalance;  \n \n(b) \nConduct its work virtually, as appropriate; \n \n(c) \nComprise members who are appointed for a four-year term and are eligible \nfor reappointment;  \n \n13. Also decides that the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the \nOffice of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked \nDeveloping Countries and Small Island Developing States of the Secretariat, within \ntheir respective mandates, should continue to act as interim secretariat for the \nmultidimensional vulnerability index, until a relevant existing United Nations entity \nis appointed to act as the secretariat of the multidimensional vulnerability index by \nthe Secretary-General; \n \n14. Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that adequate resources are \navailable to support the work on the multidimensional vulnerability index, including \nits periodic review, in particular for travel for the members of the Independent Expert \nAdvisory Panel who are from developing countries, especially from least developed \ncountries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, when \nin-person meetings are needed; \n \n15.
