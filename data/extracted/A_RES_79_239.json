Artificial intelligence in the military domain and its implications \nfor international peace and security \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nAffirming that international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, \ninternational humanitarian law and international human rights law, applies to matters \ngoverned by it that occur throughout the life cycle of artificial intelligence capabilities \nas well as the systems they enable in the military domain, \n \nStressing the importance of ensuring responsible application of artificial \nintelligence in the military domain, which, for the purpose of this resolution, includes \nhuman-centric, accountable, safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence used \nin compliance with international law, \n \nBearing in mind that this resolution focuses on the whole life cycle of artificial \nintelligence capabilities applied in the military domain, including the stages of pre-\ndesign, design, development, evaluation, testing, deployment, use, sale, procurement, \noperation and decommissioning, and that this resolution does not cover artificial \nintelligence in the civilian domain,  \n \nMindful that States have started to increasingly integrate artificial intelligence \ninto a broad array of applications in the military domain, including into weapons, \nweapon systems, and other means and methods of warfare, as well as systems that \nsupport military operations, \n \nCognizant of potential implications for international peace and security, in \nparticular in the fields of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, resulting \nfrom developments related to the application of artificial intelligence in the military \ndomain,  \n\nA/RES/79/239 \nArtificial intelligence in the military domain and its implications \nfor international peace and security\n \n24-24617\n2/4 \n \n \nRecognizing the need to enhance a shared understanding of potential effects of \nartificial intelligence in the military domain to harness the benefits while minimizing \nthe risks of its use, and the need to further assess them, \n \nMindful of the potential opportunities and benefits of artificial intelligence in \nthe military domain, such as in the areas of compliance with international \nhumanitarian law, including protection of civilians and civilian objects in armed \nconflict, \n \nMindful also of the challenges and concerns that the application of artificial \nintelligence in the military domain raises from humanitarian, legal, security, \ntechnological and ethical perspectives, as well as the possible impact of such \napplications on international security and stability, including the risk of an arms race, \nmiscalculation, lowering the threshold for conflict and escalation of conflict, \nproliferation to non-State actors, and also noting the possible consequences with \nregard to, inter alia, gender, racial, age or social aspects that could potentially be \ncaused by bias in datasets or other algorithmic biases of artificial intelligence, \n \nMindful further of the need for States to implement appropriate safeguards, \nincluding measures that relate to human judgment and control over the use of force, \nin order to ensure responsible application of artificial intelligence in the military \ndomain consistent with their respective obligations under applicable international \nlaw, \n \nTaking note of the report of the Secretary-General on current developments in \nscience and technology and their potential impact on international security and \ndisarmament efforts,1  \n \nRecognizing the need to narrow the existing digital and artificial intelligence \ndivides in societies and economies between and within developed and developing \ncountries, with specific consideration given to the needs, priorities and conditions of \ndeveloping countries, and therefore cognizant of the importance to enhance \ninternational cooperation and strengthening capacity-building,  \n \nRecognizing also the criticality of enhanced understanding and awareness of the \nimplications of artificial intelligence in the military domain, including through \nknowledge exchange and the sharing of good practices and lessons learned among all \nStates, \n \nAcknowledging the contribution of United Nations entities, international and \nregional organizations, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross, \nacademia, civil society, the technical community and the private sector in supporting \nStates in understanding and addressing the peace and security implications of the \napplication of artificial intelligence in the military domain, and underlining the \nimportance of a multi-stakeholder approach, \n \nAcknowledging also national, regional, subregional and global efforts \nundertaken to address the potential risks to international peace and security that could \nbe raised by the application of artificial intelligence in the military domain, including \nthrough the development of relevant national strategies, legislation, principles, \nnorms, policies and measures, and recognizing the importance of promoting dialogue \nat all levels,  \n \nTaking note of the Pact for the Future,2 including the decision by Heads of State \nand Government to continue to assess the existing and potential risks associated with \n__________________ \n \n1  A/79/224. \n \n2  Resolution 79/1. \n\nArtificial intelligence in the military domain and its implications \nfor international peace and security \nA/RES/79/239\n \n3/4\n24-24617 \n \nthe military applications of artificial intelligence and the possible opportunities \nthroughout their life cycle, in consultation with relevant stakeholders,  \n \nTaking note also of the discussions currently taking place in the United Nations \nDisarmament Commission on recommendations on common understandings related \nto emerging technologies in the context of international security and in the \nConference on Disarmament, and noting also the meeting of the United Nations \nSecurity Council on artificial intelligence: opportunities and risks for international \npeace and security, held on 18 July 2023, \n \nAcknowledging the urgent need for the international community to address the \nchallenges and concerns raised by emerging technologies in the area of lethal \nautonomous weapons systems, in particular through the ongoing and valuable work \nof the Group of Governmental Experts on Emerging Technologies in the Area of \nLethal Autonomous Weapons Systems, established under the Convention on \nProhibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons 3  and \nwelcoming the progress made in these discussions, as well as taking note of the report \nof the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to United Nations General Assembly \nresolution 78/241 of 22 December 2023 on lethal autonomous weapons systems, 4 as \nwell as the need to ensure complementarity between discussions in this regard and \ndiscussions on the broader security implications of artificial intelligence in the \nmilitary domain,  \n \nRecognizing the value of an inclusive multilateral exchange of views on \nartificial intelligence in the military domain and its implications for international \npeace and security, \n \n1. \nAffirms that international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, \ninternational humanitarian law and international human rights law, applies to matters \ngoverned by it that occur throughout all stages of the life cycle of artificial \nintelligence, including systems enabled by artificial intelligence, in the military \ndomain; \n \n2. \nEncourages States to pursue national, regional,

\nartificial intelligence in the military domain;  \n \n3. \nAlso encourages States to continue assessing implications of the \napplication of artificial intelligence in the military domain for international peace and \nsecurity, including through a multilateral dialogue in relevant international forums; \n \n4. \nEncourages the Secretariat and other entities of the United Nations system, \nthrough voluntary contributions, to facilitate knowledge-sharing and raise awareness \nof the implications of artificial intelligence in the military domain for international \npeace and security, such as by convening a series of exchanges on this topic;  \n \n5. \nEncourages States to convene exchanges on responsible application of \nartificial intelligence in the military domain, including
