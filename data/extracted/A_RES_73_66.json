the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency at its sixty-second regular session, which address measures to strengthen \ninternational cooperation in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety and \nmeasures to enhance nuclear security, \n \nStressing the importance of the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency \nin promoting and reinforcing the safety and security of radioactive sources, in \nparticular by establishing technical guidance and supporting States in the \nimprovement of national legal and regulatory infrastructure, and in strengthening \ncoordination and complementarities among various nuclear or radiological security \nactivities, \n \nNoting the organization by the International Atomic Energy Agency of the \nInternational Conference on Nuclear Security: Enhancing Global Efforts, held in \nVienna from 1 to 5 July 2013, the International Conference on the Safety and Security \nof Radioactive Sources: Maintaining the

\ntrafficking of nuclear and other radioactive material, encouraging the International \nAtomic Energy Agency to further facilitate, including through designated points of \ncontact, the timely exchange of information, including through secured electronic \naccess to information contained in the Database, and encouraging also all States to \njoin and participate actively in the Database programme in support of their national \nefforts to prevent, detect and respond to radioactive and nuclear materials that may \nhave fallen out of regulatory control, \n \nNoting further the importance of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent \nFuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management 4 with respect \nto its provisions on the safety of disused sealed sources, \n \nHighlighting the importance of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security \nof Radioactive Sources, of its supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export \nof Radioactive Sources and of its supplementary Guidance on the Management of \nDisused Radioactive Sources as valuable instruments for enhancing the safety and \nsecurity of radioactive sources, noting that 137 States members of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency have made a political commitment to implement the \n__________________ \n \n2  Ibid., vol. 1456, No. 24631. \n \n3  See International Atomic Energy

\nNoting the various international efforts and partnerships to enhance nuclear and \nradiological security, encouraging further efforts to secure radioactive sources, and \nnoting also in this respect guidance and recommendations of the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency with regard to safe and secure management of radioactive sources, \n \nTaking note of the findings of the International Conference on the Safety and \nSecurity of Radioactive Sources of 2013, which, inter alia, call for further assessment \nof the merits of developing an international convention on the safety and security of \nradioactive sources so that Member States can make the best-informed decisions on \nthe matter, \n \nNoting that the Radiological and Nuclear Terrorism Prevention Unit of the \nInternational Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) works with nations to \nstrengthen capabilities to counter radioactive source smuggling and prevent terrorists \nfrom acquiring such materials,
