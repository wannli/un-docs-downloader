8843. \n\nA/RES/78/20 \nReducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of \nresponsible behaviours\n \n23-24507\n2/4 \n \n \nUrging all States, when developing, planning and executing their space \nactivities, to remain committed to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space and \nto refrain from conducting activities contrary to their obligations under international \nlaw, including those that could threaten the ability of all States to freely use and \nexplore outer space, now and in the future, \n \nSeriously concerned about the possibility of an arms race in outer space, and \nreaffirming that the prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a grave \ndanger for international peace and security, as well as being an essential condition for \nthe promotion and strengthening of international cooperation in the exploration and \nuse of outer space for peaceful purposes, \n \nStressing that the deliberate destruction of space systems increases the amount \nof long-lived orbital debris, the risk of in-orbit collisions and the potential for \nmisunderstanding and miscalculations that could lead to conflict, and welcoming the \ncommitment of several States not to conduct destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite \nmissile tests, \n \nNoting the rapid advances of technologies in space systems, the uses of which \nare diverse and could have positive or negative effects on international security, and \nencouraging further discussion among States of the impact of these developments, \n \nRecognizing the need for States to seek to avoid and mitigate the potential \nimpact on peace and security arising from accidents, miscommunication or a lack of \ntransparency, which could lead to miscalculations and the escalation of tensions and \ncontribute to an arms race, \n \nAcknowledging the importance of space systems in the provision of services \ncritical to civilians, and concerned at the risk of harm arising from threats to these \nsystems, \n \nRecalling paragraph 80 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of \nthe General Assembly,2 in which it is stated that, in order to prevent an arms race in \nouter space, further measures should be taken and appropriate international \nnegotiations held in accordance with the spirit of the Treaty on Principles Governing \nthe Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon \nand Other Celestial Bodies, \n \nConvinced that possible solutions to outer space security, including norms, rules \nand principles of responsible behaviours, can involve a combination of legally \nbinding obligations and political commitments, and that work in both of these areas \ncan be further pursued in a progressive, sustained and complementary manner, \nwithout undermining existing legal obligations, \n \nRecognizing that efforts to prevent an arms race and to prevent conflict from \nbeginning in or extending into outer space must include consideration of the use of \nall potential technologies and means, whether on Earth or in outer space, \n \nReiterating the common objective of preventing an arms race in outer space in \nall its aspects and the consequent need for all States to work together to reduce threats \nto space systems through the further development and implementation of norms, rules \nand principles of responsible behaviours, including an appropriate combination of \nboth political commitments and legally binding instruments, with the aim of \npreventing an arms race in outer space in all its aspects and of maintaining a peaceful, \nsafe, stable, secure and sustainable outer space environment, \n__________________ \n \n2  Resolution S-10/2. \n\nReducing space threats through norms, rules and principles

further consideration of effective \nverification regarding space systems, \n \nRecalling the primary role of the Conference on Disarmament on questions \nrelating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space in all its aspects, including \nthe weaponization of outer space and threats from capabilities on Earth, and the \nrelevant responsibilities of the First Committee of the General Assembly and the \nDisarmament Commission, \n \nWelcoming the ongoing work by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer \nSpace on the implementation of the 21 Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability \nof Outer Space Activities,3 which may have a positive effect on international peace \nand security, \n \nWelcoming also the recommendations to promote the practical implementation \nof transparency and confidence-building measures in outer space with the goal of \npreventing an arms race in outer space in accordance with the recommendations set out \nin the report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Transparency and Confidence-\nBuilding Measures in Outer Space Activities adopted by the Disarmament Commission \nat its substantive session of 2023,4  \n \nRecognizing the importance of the full, equal, meaningful and effective \nparticipation of women and men in discussions on reducing space threats through \nresponsible behaviours and the need to address the possible differentiated impacts of \nsuch threats, \n \n1. \nReaffirms that all States must conduct their activities in the exploration \nand use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, in conformity \nwith international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, urges Member \nStates to ensure that their space policies comply with their obligations, and \nencourages those States that have
