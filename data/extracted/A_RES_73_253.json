Migration, Agriculture and Rural \nDevelopment, issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, \n \nRemaining deeply concerned that, according to the most recent estimates of the \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Food \nProgramme, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the World Health \nOrganization and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the number of chronically \nundernourished people in the world increased to nearly 821 million in 2017, from \naround 804 million in 2016, and that global nutrition challenges are increasingly \ncomplex as multiple forms of malnutrition, including stunting, wasting, underweight, \nmicronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity, may coexist within the same \ncountry or household, \n \nRecognizing that economic slowdown, gender inequalities, conflict, drought and \nthe adverse effects of climate change, including more frequent and extreme weather \nevents, are among the key factors contributing to a reversal in the long-term progress \nin fighting global hunger, making the prospect of ending hunger and all forms of \nmalnutrition by 2030 more difficult, \n \nRemaining deeply concerned about the continuing food insecurity and \nmalnutrition being faced by hundreds of millions of people, in particular in \nsub-Saharan Africa and in South and West Asia, \n \nRecognizing the need to prevent the recurrence in the future of deaths of people \nfrom famine, \n \nExpressing its concern about the growing number of obese adults in the world, \nfrom 563.7 million in 2012 to 672.3 million in 2016, \n \nExpressing its concern also that, according to the Global Report on Food Crises \n2018, the number of people facing crisis-level food insecurity or worse has increased \ndramatically, up from almost 108 million in 2016 to 124 million in 2017 in countries \naffected by, inter alia, conflict and exacerbated by climate-related events, \nenvironmental factors, including natural disasters, and excessive food price volatility, \n \nNoting that an increasing number of countries, in particular in Africa, Asia, \nLatin America and the Pacific, are integrating food security and nutrition into their \nagriculture policies and investment plans and that, as a result, eradicating hunger, \nimproving food security and ensuring adequate nutrition are being given greater \nprominence in regional development strategies, such as the African Union Malabo \nDeclaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation for Shared \nProsperity and Improved Livelihoods, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nfood security and nutrition strategy, the Piura Declaration on Food Security, the \nFramework for Multi-Year Programme on Food Security and Climate Change and \nthe Strategic Framework on Rural-Urban Development to Strengthen Food Security \nand Quality Growth, adopted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the \nHunger-Free Latin America and the Caribbean 2025 Initiative, the strategy on food \nsecurity and nutrition of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries and the \nArab food security initiative, all of which emphasized the importance of investing \nin agriculture, diversifying food production and diets and providing quality \nnutritional education to consumers, introducing labour-saving technologies in food \nproduction and processing, enhancing women\u2019s access to income and strengthening \ncapacity-building in improving food safety at all stages of the food chain, and noting \nalso the establishment of the Islamic Organization for Food Security, headquartered \nin Astana, \n \nReiterating the urgent need for action to address the adverse effects of climate \nchange on

the other root causes of food insecurity and all forms of \nmalnutrition, \n \nExpressing concern that climate change will disproportionately impact the most \nvulnerable people, especially women and children, and their livelihoods, ultimately \nputting hundreds of millions of people at risk, and that by 2050, the risk of hunger \nand child malnutrition could increase by up to 20 per cent owing to climate change, \n \nReiterating the importance of gender equality and the empowerment of women \nand girls, as well as the recognition and protection of the rights of small-holders, \nparticularly women, reiterating also the importance, inter alia, of empowering rural \nwomen, youth, small-scale farmers, family farmers and livestock farmers, fishers and \nfish workers as critical agents for enhancing agricultural and rural development and \nfood security and for improving nutrition outcomes, and acknowledging their \nfundamental contribution to the environmental sustainability and the genetic \npreservation of agricultural systems and to sustaining productivity on often marginal \nlands, \n \nRecognizing that livestock contributes 40 per cent of the global value of \nagricultural output and supports the livelihoods and food security of almost 1.3 billion \npeople, and in this regard acknowledging that the sector offers opportunities for \nsustainable agricultural development, poverty eradication and food security gains, \nand offers an opportunity for raising climate awareness, \n \nAcknowledging that social protection programmes and measures are effective in \nreducing poverty and hunger, \n \nRecognizing the importance of initiatives under the United Nations system, \nincluding the observance of World Pulses Day, World Tuna Day, Sustainable \nGastronomy Day, World Bee Day, World Food Safety Day, World Soil Day, the \nInternational Year of Camelids, the International Year of Plant Health, the \nInternational Decade for Action, \u201cWater for Sustainable

benefits, in \naccordance with General Assembly resolutions 53/199 of 15 December 1998 and \n61/185 of 20 December 2006 on the proclamation of international years and \nEconomic and Social Council resolution 1980/67 of 25 July 1980 on international \nyears and anniversaries, \n \nRecognizing also the need to increase responsible public and private investment \nin the agriculture sector, inter alia, to find inclusive solutions to and fight hunger and \nmalnutrition and to promote rural and urban sustainable development, \n \nRecalling the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030 and \nits guiding principles, 28  and recalling also its promotion of regular disaster \npreparedness, response and recovery exercises, at the national and local levels, with \na view to ensuring rapid and effective response to disasters and related displacement, \nincluding access to essential food and non-food relief supplies, as appropriate to local \nneeds, \n \nNoting the Committee on World Food Security Framework for Action for Food \nSecurity and Nutrition in Protracted Crises, the Committee\u2019s policy recommendations \non sustainable fisheries and aquaculture for food security and nutrition and its policy \nrecommendations on food losses and waste in the context of sustainable food systems, \n \nRecalling that the Sustainable Development Goals and targets are

of the Secretary-General;29 \n \n2. \nStresses the importance of continued consideration of the issue of \nagriculture development, food security and nutrition, and encourages Member States \nand relevant stakeholders to give due consideration to this issue while implementing \nthe internationally agreed development goals, in particular the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development30 and its Sustainable Development Goals; \n \n3. \nEmphasizes that sustainable agricultural production, food security, food \nsafety and nutrition are key elements for the eradication of poverty in all its forms \nand dimensions, and calls for greater efforts to sustainably enhance the agricultural \nproduction capacities, productivity and food security of developing countries; \n \n4. \nAlso emphasizes the need to accelerate and scale up action, as appropriate, \nto strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of food systems and people\u2019s \nlivelihoods in response to climate variability and extremes, to achieve a world without \nhunger and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030; \n \n5. \nExpresses concern that the world is not on track to eradicate hunger and \nmalnutrition by 2030 and that scarce and unsustainably managed natural resources, \ncombined with insecure and uneven tenure rights for smallholders, are severely \naffecting those in vulnerable situations in rural areas, that climate change, including \nthe adverse impact of sea level rise, drought, desertification and conflict and \npost-conflict situations are challenges with regard to food security and nutrition and \ndiet-related non-communicable diseases in many places, preventing progress in the \nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, and that countries in \nprotracted crises are at risk of being left behind; \n \n6. \nStresses that urgent and concerted action is needed at all levels to recover \nmomentum and accelerate efforts to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition, \ncomprehensively tackling both its causes and effects, and to promote improved \nnutrition and sustainable agriculture and food systems; \n \n7. \nReiterates the importance of developing countries determining their own \nfood security strategies, that improving food security and nutrition is a global \nchallenge and a national policy responsibility and that any plans for addressing this \nchallenge in the context of eradicating poverty must be nationally articulated, \ndesigned, owned, led and built in consultation, as an inclusive process, with all key \nstakeholders at the national level, as appropriate, and urges Member States, especially \nthose affected, to make food security, food safety and nutrition a high priority and to \nreflect this in their national programmes and budgets; \n \n8. \nCalls upon the international community to continue its support for the \nimplementation of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme \n__________________ \n \n29
