practical and innovative approaches to the options for self-\ndetermination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, size of \npopulation or natural resources, \n \nConvinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should \ncontinue to guide the development of their future political status and that referendums, \nfree and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an important role \nin ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people, \n \nConcerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the \nTerritories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy and \nby the

of the importance both to Guam and to the Special Committee of the \nparticipation of elected and appointed representatives of Guam in the work of the \nCommittee, \n \nRecognizing the need for the

the \nCaribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of \nrepresentatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for \nthe Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the \nseminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element \nin the context of a United Nations programme for

federal court in the United States, the \nadministering Power, holding that the plebiscite could not be limited to native \ninhabitants, \n \nRecalling, in this regard, the statement made by a representative of the Governor \nof Guam at the 2019 Caribbean regional seminar concerning the implications of the \njudicial case in the light of the nature and essence of the Charter of the United

of the CHamoru people of Guam to self-determination for the Territory, \n \nAware that negotiations between the administering Power and the territorial \nGovernment on the draft Guam Commonwealth Act ended in 1997 and that Guam has \nsubsequently established a non-binding plebiscite process for a self-determination \nvote by the eligible CHamoru voters, \n__________________ \n \n5 Official Records
