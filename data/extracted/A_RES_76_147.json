\nwhere appropriate, and intergovernmental organizations, and recognizing the \nvaluable role of national human rights institutions and civil society, including \nnon-governmental organizations,  \n \nRecognizing \nthe \nimportance \nof \ninternational, \nregional \nand \nbilateral \nmulti-stakeholder partnerships and initiatives to advance the effective protection and \npromotion of the rights of the child and the elimination of all forms of violence against \nchildren, including all violent punishment of children,  \n \nRecognizing also that violence against children undermines efforts to implement \nthe 2030 Agenda and hinders progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, and that the negative and long-term impact of violence on the \ndevelopment of children stifles their potential to become active participants in society,  \n \nEncouraging all States to strengthen efforts to prevent the military use of \nschools in contravention of international law and to promote and protect the right to \neducation, to make it accessible, inclusive, quality and non-discriminatory and to \nfacilitate the continuation of education in situations of armed conflict, and \nencouraging all States to strengthen efforts to protect children affected by armed \nconflict, including from the recruitment or use by armed forces or armed groups and \nby supporting long-term and sustainable reintegration and rehabilitation for these \nchildren,  \n \nUrging all States to promote, respect, protect and fulfil the right of children, \nincluding children with disabilities and children in vulnerable situations, to express \nthemselves freely and their right to be heard, to ensure that they have access to quality \neducation and information in child-friendly formats, that their views are given due \nweight and that they are included in decision-making processes, in accordance with \ntheir evolving capacities or age and maturity, in all matters affecting them, including \nthose relating to relevant aspects of the 2030 Agenda, while recognizing also the \nimportance of involving children\u2019s organizations and child-led initiatives,  \n \nConcerned about the occurrence of bullying, including cyberbullying, in all \nparts of the world and the fact that children who are victimized by such practices may \nbe at heightened risk of compromising their health, emotional well-being, academic \nwork and education and for a wide range of physical and/or mental health conditions, \nas well as potential long-term effects on individuals\u2019 ability to realize their own \npotential,  \n \nDeeply concerned that children disproportionately suffer the consequences of \ndiscrimination, exclusion and inequality and that the situation of children in many \nparts of the world remains negatively affected by the prolonged effects of poverty and \ninequality, reaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is one \nof the greatest global challenges and an indispensable requirement for sustainable \ndevelopment, recognizing the impact of poverty beyond the socioeconomic context \nand the intrinsic interlinkage between poverty eradication and the promotion of \nsustainable development, and in this regard underlining the importance of the \nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda and recognizing that a strong focus is needed on \npoverty, deprivation and inequality to prevent and protect children from all forms of \nviolence and to promote the resilience of children, their families and their \ncommunities,  \n \nRecognizing that the girl child is often at greater risk of being exposed to and \nencountering various forms of discrimination and violence, including sexual and \n\nRights of the child \nA/RES/76/147\n \n5/17\n21-19187 \n \ngender-based violence, and harmful practices, such as child, early and forced \nmarriage and child labour, which, among other things, would hinder the realization \nof her rights and efforts towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development \nGoals, particularly those Goals that are relevant to gender equality and the \nempowerment of girls, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure \na just and equitable world for girls, including by partnering with men and boys, as an \nimportant strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child,  \n \nRecognizing also that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is \ncritical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Sustainable Development \nGoals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the full, \nequal and meaningful participation of girls in decision-making that affects them, are \nkey in breaking the cycle of all forms of discrimination and violence and in promoting \nand protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing \nfurther that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making \nprocesses in accordance with their evolving capacities or age and maturity and as \nagents of change in their own lives and communities,  \n \nExpressing serious concern that children with disabilities, particularly girls, \nface stigmatization, discrimination or exclusion and are disproportionately subjected \nto mental and physical violence and sexual abuse in all settings,  \n \nExpressing further concern that children often face persecution, including abuse \nand violence, stigmatization, discrimination, bullying and exclusion from education \nand training, as well as a lack of family and social support, access to relevant health-\ncare services and information, and, in extreme cases, sexual assault, rape and death,  \n \nRecalling that the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires States parties \nto pursue the full implementation of the right of the child to the enjoyment of the \nhighest attainable standard of physical and mental health by taking measures to, inter \nalia, combat disease and malnutrition, including through ensuring access to health-\ncare services, provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking water, \nhygiene and sanitation, and reducing exposure to harmful substances or \nenvironmental conditions that directly or indirectly affect their health, \n \nReaffirming the need to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under \n5 years of age, and recognizing that infectious diseases, including pneumonia, \ndiarrhoea and malaria, remain a leading cause of deaths of children under 5, along \nwith pre-term birth and intrapartum-related complications,  \n \nRecognizing that the risk of maternal mortality is highest for girls under 15 years \nof age and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death \namong girls under 15 years of age in many countries,  \n \nRecognizing also that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and \nmorbidity rates between developed and developing countries as well as within and \namong countries, particularly in rural and remote areas and the poorest urban areas,  \n \nProfoundly concerned that children, particularly in early childhood, in many \nparts of the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impacts of climate \nchange and environmental degradation, including natural disasters, persistent \ndrought, extreme weather events, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and \nocean acidification, loss of biodiversity and pollution, which further threaten health, \nfood security and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, \nand in this regard calling for the strengthened implementation of the Paris Agreement \nadopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 34  \n__________________ \n \n34  See FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21, annex. \n\nA/RES/76/147 \nRights of the child\n \n21-19187\n6/17 \n \n \nReaffirming that States have the obligation to promote, respect, protect and fulfil \nhuman rights, including in actions undertaken to address environmental harm, such \nas loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and exposure to hazardous \nsubstances and wastes, and to take appropriate measures to protect the rights of the \nchild, and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to the \neffects of environmental harm should be taken,  \n \nRecalling the importance of promoting and protecting the human rights and \nfundamental freedoms of all migrant children, regardless of their migration status, \nwith the best interests of the child as a primary consideration; reaffirming all latest \ninternational policy developments and relevant United Nations agreements in this \nregard; and strengthening international and regional cooperation, within the \nframework of the United Nations and relevant regional forums,  \n \nRecognizing that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the \ngreatest global challenges in the history of the United Nations, and noting with deep \nconcern its disproportionately heavy impact, inter alia on children, and its impact on \nhealth and the loss of life, mental health and well-being, as well as the negative impact \non global humanitarian needs and the enjoyment of human rights and across all \nspheres of society, including on livelihoods, food security and nutrition, and \neducation, the exacerbation of poverty and hunger, disruption to economies, trade, \nsocieties and environments, and the exacerbation of economic and social inequalities \nwithin and among countries, which is reversing hard-won development gains and \nhampering progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and all its Goals and targets,  \n \nDeeply concerned about the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 \npandemic on children, especially girls, including on their access to essential health-\ncare services, and about the reported surge in sexual and gender-based violence, \nincluding domestic violence and violence in digital contexts, during confinement,  \n \nDeeply concerned also about the disproportionate effect of the COVID-19 \npandemic on children from developing countries due to existing inequalities and \ndigital divides, both among and within countries, and that the loss of learning during \nthe pandemic, compounded by the risk of many girls not returning to school after the \npandemic, will have serious long-term effects on literacy rates as well as the overall \ndevelopment of developing countries,  \n \nRecognizing that there is increased reliance on virtual learning, with more than \n90 per cent of governments enacting policies to provide digital or broadcast learning, \nand that while meaningful access to digital technologies can support children to \nrealize the full range of their rights, challenges faced by children in accessing the \nInternet and digital devices can limit the enjoyment of their right to education and \nincrease inequalities among and within countries, with children living in rural areas, \nchildren living with disabilities and from the poorest households being the most \naffected,  \n \nStressing that information and communications technologies and applications \ncan create new ways to enhance education and foster learning and teaching on the \nrights of the child and can be useful tools to promote the enjoyment of children\u2019s \nrights and their protection, and in that regard stressing the need for enhanced efforts \nto expand connectivity, affordability, digital learning and associated skills bridging \nthe digital divides, including the gender digital divides, while protecting children \nfrom violence in the digital environment,  \n \nDeeply concerned that increased unsupervised use of the Internet, inter alia \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, has exacerbated children\u2019s exposure to the risk of \nall forms of violence, including in the digital context, inter alia sexual harassment, \npeer-to-peer sexual harassment and cyberbullying, child sexual exploitation and \n\nRights of the child \nA/RES/76/147\n \n7/17\n21-19187 \n \nabuse, child grooming, trafficking in persons, hate speech, stigmatization, racism, \nxenophobia and discrimination,  \n \n1. \nRecognizes that the

comprehensive set of \ninternational legal standards for the protection and well-being of children;  \n \n2. \nCalls upon States parties to increase their efforts for the full \nimplementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child;  \n \n3. \nReaffirms paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of its resolution 71/177 of 19 December \n2016 and that the general principles of, inter alia, the best interests of the child, \nnon-discrimination, participation and survival and development provide the \nframework for all actions concerning children;  \n \n4. \nUrges States that have not yet done so to consider becoming parties to the \nConvention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols thereto as a matter \nof priority and to implement them effectively, and encourages further efforts by the \nSecretary-General in this regard;  \n \n5. \nUrges States parties to withdraw reservations that are incompatible with \nthe object and purpose of the Convention or the Optional Protocols thereto and to \nconsider reviewing regularly other reservations with a view to withdrawing them in \naccordance with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action;  \n \n6. \nTakes note of the work of the Special Representatives of the Secretary-\nGeneral on Violence against Children and for Children and Armed Conflict, the \nSpecial Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the sale and sexual exploitation \nof children, including child prostitution, child pornography and other sexual abuse \nmaterial, and the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and, in this regard, their \ncontribution to the progress achieved in the promotion and protection of the rights of \nchildren;  \n \n7. \nReaffirms section I of its resolution 74/133, entitled \u201cChildren without \nparental care\u201d, which addresses, among other things, the economic and social well-\nbeing of children; the right to education; promoting and protecting the rights of \nchildren, including children in particularly difficult situations, including children with \ndisabilities; migrant children; children affected by armed conflict; children facing \nmultiple and intersecting forms of discrimination; the human rights of children in \nalternative care; the importance of mainstreaming a gender perspective; and children \nwho are victims of trafficking; children in vulnerable situations children with \nHIV/AIDS and other serious illnesses;  \n \n8. \nCalls upon States to ensure the enjoyment by all children of all their civil, \npolitical, economic, social and cultural rights without discrimination of any kind;  \n \n9. \nNotes with concern the large number of children belonging to national, \nethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, migrant children, refugee or asylum-\nseeking children, internally displaced children, children with disabilities, children of \nAfrican descent and indigenous children who are victims of discrimination, including \nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, stresses the need to \nincorporate gender-sensitive and special measures, into education programmes and \nprogrammes to combat these practices, in accordance with the principle of the best \ninterests of the child and respect for their views, including children with disabilities, \nand calls upon States to provide special support and to ensure equal access to services \nfor those children and their effective protection;  \n\nA/RES/76/147 \nRights of the child\n \n21-19187\n8/17 \n \n \n10.

Urges States to improve the situation of children living in poverty, in \nparticular extreme poverty, deprived of adequate nutritious food, clean drinking water \nand sanitation facilities, with limited or no access to basic physical and mental health-\ncare services, shelter, education, participation and protection, taking into account that, \nwhile a severe lack of goods and services hurts every human being, it is particularly \nthreatening and harmful to children, leaving them unable to enjoy their rights, to reach \ntheir full potential and to participate as full members of society, and exposed to \nconditions that lead to increased violence; \n \n13. Calls upon all States and the international community to cooperate, \nsupport and participate in the global efforts for poverty eradication, to invest in \nchildren and mobilize all necessary resources and support in that regard, according to \nnational plans and strategies, including through an integrated and multifaceted \napproach based on the well-being of children, and to accelerate their efforts to realize \nthe internationally agreed development and poverty eradication goals, including the \nSustainable Development Goals, within their time framework, and reaffirms that \ninvestments in children and the realization of their rights are among the most effective \nways to eradicate poverty;  \n \n14. Calls upon States to scale up scientifically accurate and age-appropriate \ncomprehensive education, relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls \nand boys and young women and men, in and out of school, consistent with their \nevolving capacities, and with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and \nlegal guardians, with the best interests of the child as their basic concern, with \ninformation on sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention, gender equality \nand women\u2019s empowerment, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal \ndevelopment and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to \nbuild self-esteem and foster informed decision-making, communication and risk \nreduction skills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young \npeople, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in \norder to, inter alia, enable them protect themselves from HIV infection and other \nrisks;  \n \n15. Reaffirms the right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and \nnon-discrimination, and calls upon States to make primary education compulsory, \ninclusive and available free to all children, ensuring that all children have equal access \nto education of good quality, making secondary education generally available and \naccessible to all, in particular through the progressive introduction of free education, \nbearing in mind that special measures to ensure equal access, including affirmative \naction, contribute to achieving equal opportunity and combating exclusion by \neliminating social, economic and gender disparities in education and ensuring school \n__________________ \n \n35  Resolution 70/1. \n\nRights of the child \nA/RES/76/147\n \n9/17\n21-19187 \n \nattendance, in particular for girls, children with disabilities, pregnant adolescent girls, \nchildren living in poverty, indigenous children, children of African descent, persons \nbelonging to ethnic or religious minorities and children in vulnerable or marginalized \nsituations;  \n \n16.
