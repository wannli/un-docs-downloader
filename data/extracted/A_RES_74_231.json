integrated national financing frameworks, will be at the heart \nof efforts by Member States, reiterating that each country has primary responsibility \nfor its own economic and social development and

policies \nfor poverty eradication and sustainable development while remaining consistent with \nrelevant international rules and commitments, recognizing that national development \nefforts need to be supported by an enabling international economic environment, \nincluding coherent and mutually supporting world trade, monetary and financial \nsystems and strengthened and enhanced global economic governance, and \nhighlighting the fact that processes to develop and facilitate the availability of \nappropriate knowledge and technologies globally, on mutually agreed terms, as well \nas

Partnership for Sustainable Development and for the \nachievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \n \nRecognizing that, as per capita income increases above low-income thresholds,

Global Partnership for \nSustainable Development, led by Governments, will be a vehicle for strengthening \ninternational cooperation and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment, while noting that multi-stakeholder partnerships and the resources, \nknowledge and ingenuity of the private sector, civil society, the scientific community, \nacademia, philanthropy

countries and, in particular, African \ncountries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small \nisland developing States deserve special attention, as do countries in situations of \nconflict and post-conflict countries, and that there are also serious challenges within \nmany middle-income countries, \n \nRecognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to development and that \ndevelopment cooperation by the United Nations development system should respond \nto the varying development needs of programme countries, including those of middle-\nincome countries, in a manner that addresses their specific challenges while mindful \nof their diversity, and recognizing also that revitalized, strategic, flexible and results- \nand action-oriented United

strategies and \ncircumstances in support of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment, \n \nNoting that, over the past 15 years, 35 low-income countries have transitioned \nto middle-income country status, reflecting the sustained economic growth achieved \nin most parts of the developing world, \n \nNoting also that national averages based on criteria such as per capita income \ndo not always reflect the actual particularities and development needs of middle-\nincome countries and that, despite notable progress in reducing poverty levels in both \n\nA/RES/74/231 \nDevelopment cooperation with middle-income countries\n \n19-22503\n4/7 \n \nabsolute and relative terms, poverty remains a problem in many middle-income \ncountries, as they are

eligibility exception, for concessional finance \nand multidimensional assessments to address the limitations of an income-only \nassessment of development and graduation readiness, \n \nRecognizing with concern that hunger and malnutrition have been increasing in \nmany countries, most of those (44 out of 65) being middle-income countries and \ncountries that rely heavily on international trade in primary commodities, \n \nRecognizing that inequality, or even a rise in inequality, remains pervasive in \nmiddle-income countries, even in those with high levels of economic growth, that \nfurther investments in social services and economic opportunities are needed in order \nto reduce inequalities and that economic growth needs to be sustained, inclusive and \nequitable, \n \nStressing that middle-income countries continue to face challenges related to, \ninter alia, job creation, natural resource management, reliance on primary commodity \nexports, the adverse effects of disaster risks and climate change, high levels of \nexternal debt and the volatility of exchange rates and capital flows and, in this regard, \nthat efforts to create a national enabling environment for development should be \ncomplemented by a global enabling environment, \n \nStressing also the importance that middle-income countries need access to and \ndevelopment of better technologies, research and innovation and better management \npractices, which can foster skills development, boost productivity and achieve \nsustainable and inclusive growth, \n \nRecognizing that connectivity through quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient \ninfrastructure, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all, contributes to \nthe sustainable development of middle-income countries, \n \nRecalling that, for all countries, public policies and the mobilization and \neffective use of domestic resources, underscored by the principle of national \nownership, are central to our common pursuit of sustainable development, including \nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals, \n \nRecalling also the resolve of Member States to enhance and strengthen domestic \nresource mobilization and fiscal space, including, where appropriate, through \nmodernized tax systems, more efficient tax collection, the broadening of the tax base \nand the effective combating of tax evasion and capital flight, and reiterating that, \nwhile each country is responsible for its tax system, it is important to support national \nefforts in these areas by strengthening technical assistance and enhancing \ninternational cooperation and participation in addressing international tax matters, \n \nRecalling further the importance of international support, in various forms, \nincluding North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation, that is well aligned \nwith national priorities to contribute to addressing the development needs of middle-\nincome countries, including through capacity-building, \n \nRecognizing the need to better understand the multidimensional nature of \ndevelopment and poverty, and acknowledging the significant role that the United \nNations system has played and should continue to play in this regard, \n \nExpressing concern that climate change is adversely affecting productivity in \nevery country, in particular developing countries, including middle-income countries, \nas extreme weather shocks directly affect productivity through the destruction of \n\nDevelopment cooperation with middle-income countries \nA/RES/74/231\n \n5/7\n19-22503 \n \ninfrastructure and labour force displacement, and that a number of middle-income \ncountries have sizeable sectors that are exposed to climate change, such as \nagriculture, construction, mining, tourism and transport, \n \nReaffirming that achieving gender equality, empowering all women and girls, \nand the full realization of their human rights are

small island developing States, grew by 8 per cent per annum \nover the period from 2009 to 2018, total external debt has grown by over 20 per cent \nsince 2016 and the current debt represents 26.8 per cent of their combined gross \ndomestic product, and that the debt of middle-income countries is not only growing \nat a faster pace than anticipated, but is a more costly debt with a shorter maturity, \n \nReiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind, reaffirming the \nrecognition that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, and the wish to see \nthe Goals and targets

order to avoid a debt crisis, and the \nimportance of debt restructurings being timely, orderly, effective, fair and negotiated \nin good faith; \n \n6. \nRecognizes that, with 73 per cent of the

\ninternationally agreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development \nGoals and targets; \n \n7. \nWelcomes the solidarity of middle-income countries with other developing \ncountries, in particular the financial, technical, technology transfer on mutually \nagreed terms and capacity-building support being provided by middle-income \ncountries, particularly to the least developed
