Progress Declaration of the International Migration \nReview Forum \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly \n \nEndorses the Progress Declaration of the International Migration Review \nForum, adopted by the Forum, as contained in the annex to the present resolution. \n \n76th plenary meeting \n7 June 2022 \n \n \n \nAnnex \n \n \nProgress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum \n \n1. \nWe, the Heads of State and Government and High Representatives, meeting at \nUnited Nations Headquarters in New York from 17 to 20 May 2022 at the first \nInternational Migration Review Forum, convened under the auspices of the General \nAssembly, determined to enhance cooperation on international migration in all its \ndimensions, to discuss and share progress on the implementation of all aspects of the \nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, 1 including as it relates to \nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 2 and with the participation of all \nrelevant stakeholders, have adopted the following Progress Declaration. \n \n__________________ \n \n1  Resolution 73/195, annex. \n \n2  Resolution 70/1. \n\nA/RES/76/266 \nProgress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum \n \n22-08884\n2/13 \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n \n2. \nWe reaffirm the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, also \nknown as the Marrakech Compact on Migration, and recall General Assembly \nresolution 73/195 of 19 December 2018, by which it endorsed the Global Compact, \nas well as General Assembly resolution 73/326 of 19 July 2019 on the format and \norganizational aspects of the international migration review forums. \n3. \nWe also reaffirm that the Global Compact is based on a set of cross-cutting and \ninterdependent guiding principles: people-centred, international cooperation, national \nsovereignty, rule of law and due process, sustainable development, human rights, \ngender-responsive, child-sensitive, whole-of-government approach and whole-of-\nsociety approach. \n4. \nWe are determined to fulfil the objectives and commitments outlined in the \nGlobal Compact, in line with its 360-degree vision, guiding principles and \ncomprehensive approach, by facilitating safe, orderly and regular migration, \npromoting the contributions of migrants at all skills levels to sustainable development \nat the local, national, regional and global levels, within the framework of the 2030 \nAgenda, and reducing the incidence and negative impact of irregular migration. \n5. \nWe acknowledge our shared responsibilities to one another as Member States of \nthe United Nations to respect each other\u2019s needs and concerns over migration, and we \nrecognize that all migrants, regardless of their migration status, are human rights \nholders, and reaffirm the need to protect their safety and dignity, and the overarching \nobligation to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms \nof all migrants, regardless of their migration status, without any kind of \ndiscrimination, while promoting the security, well-being and prosperity of all our \ncommunities. \n6. \nWe reaffirm the importance of international cooperation to facilitate safe, \norderly and regular migration, including through the implementation of planned and \nwell-governed migration policies in line with international law. \n7. \nWe recognize the positive role and contributions of migrants for inclusive growth \nand sustainable development in countries of origin, transit and destination, including \nby enriching societies through human, socioeconomic and cultural capacities. \n8. \nWe commend the positive role and contributions of millions of migrants in \nresponding to and recovering from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, \nincluding as essential workers, and remain deeply concerned that the pandemic has \nhad a severe and disproportionate impact on migrants, including through increased \nCOVID-19 exposure, discrimination, violence, job losses, wage theft, protracted \nfamily separation, and restricted or lack of access to health-care services and other \nbasic services, including vaccines, social protection, education and child services, and \nbeing subjected to unsafe and undignified returns. \n9. \nWe recognize that as many as 281 million people were international migrants in \n2020 globally, of whom 48 per cent were women and girls and 15 per cent were under \nthe age of 20, and that remittances are a critical source of support for families and \ncommunities, with migrants having transferred over 751 billion United States dollars \nin remittances in 2021 to their countries of origin. \n10. We recognize the value and dignity of the labour of all migrant workers in all \nsectors, emphasizing the importance of promoting fair labour conditions and decent \nwork and upholding international labour standards, and, in this regard, we also \nrecognize the work of women migrant workers, including in paid and unpaid care \nwork, domestic work and the informal economy, and emphasize the need to ensure \nthat they are legally protected against violence, harassment and exploitation. \n\nProgress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum \nA/RES/76/266\n \n3/13\n22-08884 \n \n11. \nWe are concerned that a growing number of migrant children, including those \nwho are unaccompanied or separated from their parents or primary caregivers, are \nparticularly vulnerable along their migration journey, and reaffirm our commitment \nto protecting the rights of the child and upholding the principle of the best interests \nof the child. \n12. We are concerned about the impact of financial and economic crises, poverty, \nhealth emergencies and food insecurity on international migration and migrants, as \nwell as sudden-onset and slow-onset natural disasters, the adverse effects of climate \nchange, and environmental degradation, such as desertification, land degradation, \ndrought, floods, water scarcity and sea level rise, taking into account the potential \nimplications for migration and migrants. \n13. We recognize the importance of creating conducive political, economic, social \nand environmental conditions for people to lead peaceful, productive and sustainable \nlives in their own country and to fulfil their personal aspirations, and, in this regard, \ndeclare our profound solidarity with and support for migrants caught up in situations \nof crisis in countries of transit and destination. \n14. We reaffirm our collective responsibility to preserve the lives of all migrants \nand take action to prevent loss of migrant lives and, in this context, remain deeply \nconcerned that thousands of migrants continue to die or go missing each year along \nperilous routes on land and at sea, in transit and destination countries, with reports of \nmore than 8,436 migrants having lost their lives and 5,534 migrants having gone \nmissing in transit globally from 2019 to 2021. \n15. We condemn acts, manifestations and expressions of racism, racial discrimination, \nxenophobia and related intolerance against migrants and diasporas and the negative \nstereotypes often applied to them, including on the basis of religion or belief. \n16. We are concerned about the risks, including for migrants, associated with \nirregular migration, smuggling of migrants and crimes against migrants, which \ncontinue to pose significant threats to the lives and well-being of migrants, and which \nrequire a concerted international assessment and response and strengthened \nmultilateral cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination. \n17. We take note with appreciation of the regional reviews of the implementation of \nthe Global Compact and the reviews of progress at the national level, including, on a \nvoluntary basis, the elaboration and use of national implementation plans and the \nmainstreaming of the Global Compact in plans and legislation, drawing on \ncontributions from and the meaningful participation of all relevant stakeholders, \nincluding migrants, as well as parliaments and local governments, in line with a \nwhole-of-government and whole-of-society approach. \n18. We recognize the work of the Global Compact Champion countries and the \nFriends of Migration group, including their initiative to share insights, lessons learned \nand promising practices in support of the implementation of the Global Compact, \nsuch as the Rabat Declaration adopted during the first ministerial meeting of the \nChampion countries on 25 March 2022. \n19. We take note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General of \n27 December 2021 on the implementation of the Global Compact, 3 and its guidance \nfor the deliberations during the Forum, including policy priorities for consideration \nby the Forum. \n20. We recognize the work of the United Nations Network on Migration in support \nof the implementation of the Global Compact, including the establishment of the \n__________________ \n \n3  A/76/642. \n\nA/RES/76/266 \nProgress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum \n \n22-08884\n4/13 \n \ncapacity-building mechanism, which comprises the migration multi-partner trust fund \nand the Migration Network Hub. \n \n \n \nProgress, challenges and gaps in the implementation of the Global Compact \n \n21. We recognize the many efforts and the progress made and the good practices \nthat have emerged in implementing the Global Compact and in realizing our collective \ngoal of advancing safe, orderly and regular migration, and in the response to and \nrecovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, by national and local governments, the \nUnited Nations system and other international and regional organizations, migrants, \ndiasporas, civil society, local communities, migrant and diaspora organizations, faith-\nbased organizations, academia, the private sector, parliamentarians, trade unions, \nnational human rights institutions, the media, humanitarian actors, volunteers and \nother relevant stakeholders. \n22. We are concerned that progress achieved in facilitating and harnessing the \nbenefits of safe, orderly and regular migration is slow and uneven in many areas and \nthat the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped many aspects of international migration \nand negatively impacted progress, and created new, and exacerbated existing \nsituations of vulnerability for migrants. Greater efforts are needed by Member States \nto develop ambitious national responses for the implementation of the Global \nCompact. We recognize that challenges and gaps in the implementation of the Global \nCompact exist and may be due, in part, to limited resources and national capacities, \nas well as insufficient coordination within and between Governments, and with \nrelevant stakeholders. \n23. We recall that in General Assembly resolution 73/326, Member States decided \nto cover all 23 objectives of the Global Compact in four round tables during the \nForum. \n \n \n \nRound table 1 (objectives 2, 5, 6, 12 and 18)4 \n \n24. Progress has been made in mainstreaming international migration into \ndevelopment plans and sectoral policies at the local, national, regional and global \nlevels, as well as in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies and policies. \nProgress has also been achieved in the conclusion of bilateral and regional labour \nmigration agreements, efforts to simplify administrative procedures related to \nmigration and actions to prevent and reduce situations of vulnerability faced by \nmigrants, in particular those in an irregular situation, including by facilitating their \naccess to regular status, the formal economy, the labour market and basic services in \nline with national legislation. However, the availability and flexibility of pathways \nfor regular migration remains limited in many cases. \n25. Progress has been made by Member States, the private sector and other \nstakeholders in promoting fair and ethical recruitment and decent work for migrant \nworkers, international labour standards, ensuring respect for and protection and \nfulfilment of human rights, and reducing or banning recruitment fees and \nstrengthening labour inspection capacities. The use of digital technologies during the \npandemic has increased, which contributed to the effectiveness and transparency of \nmigration procedures, while also raising concerns about the digital divide for many \n__________________ \n \n4  Objective 2: Minimize the adverse drivers and structural factors that compel people to leave their \ncountry of origin; objective 5: Enhance availability and flexibility of pathways for regular \nmigration; objective 6: Facilitate fair and ethical recruitment and safeguard conditions that \nensure decent work; objective 12: Strengthen certainty and predictability in migration procedures \nfor appropriate screening, assessment and referral; objective 18: Invest in skills development and \nfacilitate mutual recognition of skills, qualifications and competences. \n\nProgress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum \nA/RES/76/266\n \n5/13\n22-08884 \n \nmigrants as well as challenges related to upholding migrants\u2019 right to privacy and the \nprotection of personal data. \n26. Progress has been achieved in facilitating recognition of academic and \nvocational qualifications and skills of migrant workers and returning migrants. \n27. The adverse effects of climate change, environmental degradation and natural \ndisasters are among the drivers of migration, which are influenced by economic, \nsocial, political and demographic contexts. Efforts to mitigate and adapt to the adverse \neffects of climate change have been insufficient, including in climate finance, as \nacknowledged by the twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and as part of the \nGlasgow Climate Pact. The responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative \nimpact of climate change and systemic shocks have laid bare the gaps that remain in \nanticipating, preparing for and responding to events that might trigger large \nmovements of migrants. \n28. The lack of mutual recognition of skills and qualifications of migrants limits \ntheir potential, the benefits they can gain from their labour as well as their \ncontributions to sustainable development, and leaves migrants vulnerable to \nexploitation. Many migrant workers, especially women migrant workers, continue to \nface precarious working conditions, wage theft, labour exploitation, reduced wages, \ndiscriminatory dismissals, withholding of benefits, forced unpaid leave and protracted \nseparation from their families, which have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 \npandemic. In many cases, migration procedures lack predictability and allow for high \nlevels of undue discretionary action, undermining the rule of law and due process. \n29. The lack of access to quality education and economic opportunities, and \ninadequate investment as well as underdevelopment are among the key drivers that \ncompel young people to leave their countries of origin in search of better \nopportunities. Therefore, it remains crucial to promote sustainable development, \ngenerate employment, bridge the digital divides and empower youth to fully \nparticipate in their societies. \n \n \n \nRound table 2 (objectives 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 21)5 \n \n30. Stakeholders have developed guidance for the development of transnational \nsearch mechanisms, promoting cross-border operational cooperation and information-\nsharing, and the establishment of other internationally coordinated efforts on missing \nmigrants. Observatories have been established to collect migration data, and progress \nhas been achieved in curbing the incidence of smuggling of migrants and in improving \nthe capacity of Member States to identify networks of migrant smugglers and their \norganizers, and in identifying and responding to the needs of migrants in this regard. \n31. There are increasing efforts by Member States to foster cross-border collaboration \nfor the prevention of trafficking in persons, the investigation and prosecution of \nhuman traffickers, and to provide assistance and safe access to services to victims of \ntrafficking in persons. Efforts are being made to modernize border-crossing points, \nincluding by simplifying procedures and upgrading infrastructure and equipment, to \nreduce immigration detention, including by implementing non-custodial alternatives \n__________________ \n \n5  Objective 4: Ensure that all migrants have proof of legal identity and adequate documentation; \nobjective 8: Save lives and establish coordinated international efforts on missing migrants; \nobjective 9: Strengthen the transnational response to smuggling of migrants; objective 10: \nPrevent, combat and eradicate trafficking in persons in the context of international migration; \nobjective 11: Manage borders in an integrated, secure and coordinated manner; objective 13: Use \nmigration detention only as a measure of last resort and work towards alternatives; objective 21: \nCooperate in facilitating safe and dignified return and readmission, as well as sustainable \nreintegration. \n\nA/RES/76/266 \nProgress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum \n \n22-08884\n6/13 \n \nto detention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some Member States have \ntaken steps to end child immigration detention, advancing efforts to protect and \nrespect the best interests of the child. In response to the challenges posed by the \npandemic, some Member States temporarily suspended forced returns and expanded \nassistance to returning migrants. Some Member States have supported reintegration \nand recognized the opportunity to leverage the skills and knowledge acquired by \nreturning nationals. Nevertheless, challenges remain in all of these areas. \n32. Progress has been made in issuing migrants, including unaccompanied and \nseparated children, with adequate documentation and civil registry documents. \nHowever, challenges remain regarding international cooperation on identification of \nnationals and issuance of travel documents, as many Member States still lack robust \ncivil registration systems or the capacity to issue identity and travel documents. \nMigrants continue to face risks throughout the migration journey, owing to a lack of \nproof of legal identity, insufficient access to information or lack of predictability in \nmigration procedures. Some policies, practices and conditions associated with \nimmigration detention, including arbitrary deprivation of liberty, overcrowding and \npoor access to basic services have affected the physical and mental health and well-\nbeing of migrants, as well as child development. \n33. Migrants continue to struggle to access and receive humanitarian assistance, \nincluding search and rescue efforts and medical care, which creates and exacerbates \nsituations of vulnerability. Limited progress has been made in distinguishing the \nactivities of smuggling networks from the provision of assistance of an exclusively \nhumanitarian nature for migrants along perilous routes and in other situations where \ntheir life or safety is in danger. In many cases, the provision of such assistance has \nbeen considered unlawful. \n34. Travel restrictions imposed by countries of origin, transit and destination as a \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic have created and exacerbated situations of \nvulnerability faced by migrants, and challenges for return and readmission, in many \ncases, including through insufficient efforts to manage national borders in an integrated, \nsecure and coordinated manner that respects obligations under international law. In \nsome cases, Member States have forcibly returned migrants with insufficient regard \nfor health risks or due process and procedural safeguards, including the best interests \nof the child. Travel and other restrictions, including border closures and lockdowns, \nas well as capacity limitations, constrained the return and readmission of migrants \nwho wished to return. \n35. Safe and dignified return, readmission and sustainable reintegration in full \ncompliance with international human rights law have proven to be difficult and \ncomplex in many cases. Conditions for more predictable travel have deteriorated \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Limited progress has been made in enhancing \nbilateral and international cooperation to determine clear and mutually agreed \nprocedures that uphold procedural safeguards and guarantee individual assessments \nand legal certainty. \n36. Poverty, inequalities, economic exclusion and violence, including sexual and \ngender-based violence, which have increased during the pandemic, are among the key \nrisk factors of trafficking in persons, especially for women, children and young \npeople. The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated access to, and the provision of, \nsupport to victims of trafficking in persons. In some instances, public health \nconsiderations were used to justify detention or unlawful deportation. Member States \nalso faced practical challenges in ensuring alternatives to detention with full respect \nfor human rights, particularly with regard to providing adequate living conditions and \naccess to gender-responsive and people-centred services for migrants. \n \n\nProgress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum \nA/RES/76/266\n \n7/13\n22-08884 \n \n \n \nRound table 3 (objectives 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 and 22)6 \n \n37. In some cases, consular support has been strengthened through \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d \nvirtual mechanisms, regional and subregional coordination and consular cooperation. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also given rise to strengthened consular cooperation \nbetween States to protect their nationals and to assist them, including in the safe, \nvoluntary and dignified return of migrants. Efforts have also been made in building \nthe capacity of consular services. Several consular services implemented virtual \nservice delivery to improve accessibility in the context of reduced in-person service. \n38. Efforts to provide equal and safe access to affordable basic services, including \naccess to health-care services and vaccines, to all migrants, regardless of their \nmigration status, as well as efforts to provide all migrants with access to unemployment \nbenefits and adequate social protection, without risk of arrest, detention and \ndeportation in the context of international migration, have been essential in the \neffective response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular at the local level. \n39. Progress was also made in promoting inclusion and social cohesion, including \nthrough language training and improved access to professional training, employment, \neducation, and social inclusion and protection measures, as well as through \ncommunity awareness campaigns, based on equality, non-discrimination and ways to \npromote mutual respect for the cultures, traditions and customs of communities of \ndestination and of migrants, including acceptance of diversity. \n40. Progress was achieved in the provision of health-care services, including mental \nhealth services, and psychosocial support and assistance to those impacted by the \npandemic, including through efforts of diaspora networks and communities that set \nup humanitarian initiatives and digital platforms. Progress was also made in the \nrecognition of the human, cultural, social and economic capital that diasporas bring, \nas well as their engagement and remittances in national development strategies, and \nin programmes to improve the financial inclusion and literacy of migrant workers and \ntheir families. \n41. At the same time, many migrants and their families struggle to gain safe access \nto basic services, such as health-care services, despite being disproportionately \nexposed to COVID-19 owing to their living conditions and their employment in \nessential jobs. Migrants were often not systematically covered by COVID-19 testing, \ntreatment and vaccination policies and programmes as well as pandemic-related \nsocioeconomic support and recovery measures, despite their loss of jobs and income. \nSafe access to basic services, social protection or recovery assistance often remained \nlimited to migrants with a regular status, while migrants with irregular status \nremained in a situation of vulnerability. \n42. Many countries declared remittances to be essential services and eased \nregulations during the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitated greater digitalization, offered \nincentives and abolished or waived transaction fees. However, the cost of transferring \nremittances remained at 6.3 per cent during the third quarter of 2021. \n43. In addition to remittances remaining resilient, the pandemic has offered lessons \nto improve the remittance market, including by expanding the use of digital channels, \npromoting innovation, competition and transparency, reducing transaction costs and \n__________________ \n \n6  Objective 14: Enhance consular protection, assistance and cooperation throughout the migration \ncycle; objective 15: Provide access to basic services for migrants; objective 16: Empower \nmigrants and societies to realize full inclusion and social cohesion; objective 19: Create \nconditions for migrants and diasporas to fully contribute to sustainable development in all \ncountries; objective 20: Promote faster, safer and cheaper transfer of remittances and foster \nfinancial inclusion of migrants; objective 22: Establish mechanisms for the portability of social \nsecurity entitlements and earned benefits. \n\nA/RES/76/266 \nProgress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum \n \n22-08884\n8/13 \n \nincreasing digital and financial inclusion. However, there is an uneven distribution \nacross Member States of digital remittance channels, which depend on sound \ninfrastructure and on digital and financial inclusion. Many migrants, in particular \nmigrant women, lack access to financial services and mobile-enabled data, even though \nthey often rely on receiving remittances to support themselves and their families. \n44. Despite the fact that some Member States concluded and implemented bilateral \nand multilateral agreements to foster the portability of social security entitlements, \ncoverage and portability of such entitlements remain limited owing to exclusion, \nbarriers to eligibility, lack of implementation of existing frameworks and limited \ncross-border cooperation. \n \n \n \nRound table 4 (objectives 1, 3, 7, 17 and 23)7 \n \n45. Progress has been made in improving the collection and use of disaggregated \nmigration data, including through the establishment of migration data and knowledge \ncentres and observatories, such as the African Migration Observatory, 8 as well as the \npromotion of bilateral and regional exchanges and initiatives on migration data. \n46. During the pandemic, many Member States, including local governments, as well \nas civil society organizations and other relevant stakeholders launched awareness-\nraising initiatives and translated COVID-19-related information into multiple \nlanguages to help to improve migrants\u2019 access to information and health-care services. \n47. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, some Member States have taken action to \nreduce situations of vulnerability for migrants, including by providing them, \nregardless of their migration status, with access to COVID-19-related and other \nhealth-care services and vaccinations, by extending visa and residence permits to \navoid migrants falling into an irregular status, by halting forced returns and by \nestablishing cross-border coordination mechanisms. Many Member States and \nrelevant stakeholders, including diaspora communities, have taken steps to combat \ndiscrimination, racism, violence, xenophobia and related intolerance against migrants \nby sharing examples of migrants and communities working together to make the \nplaces where they live and work more inclusive. Many Member States and \nstakeholders cooperated in relation to implementing the Global Compact, including \nby developing and strengthening bilateral, subregional, regional, interregional and \nglobal dialogues and initiatives, such as bilateral labour migration agreements and \nregional migration observatories. \n48. Gaps in data collection and analysis persist, in many cases, owing to outdated, \nincompatible or inadequate sources and systems for high-quality, accessible, timely, \nreliable data collection and disaggregation by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, \nmigration status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in \nnational contexts, as well as limited digital capacity. The COVID-19 pandemic \nexacerbated challenges in data collection, in particular with regard to the 2020 round \nof population censuses, which are a key source of migration data. \n49. Systematic instances of intolerance, xenophobia, racism and all other multiple \nand intersecting forms of discrimination, as well as instances of racial, ethnic and \nreligious profiling of migrants, misinformation and stigma against migrants, \n__________________ \n \n7  Objective 1: Collect and utilize accurate and disaggregated data as a basis for evidence-based \npolicies; objective 3: Provide accurate and timely information at all stages of migration; \nobjective 7: Address and reduce vulnerabilities in migration; objective 17: Eliminate all forms of \ndiscrimination and promote evidence-based public discourse to shape perceptions of migration; \nobjective 23: Strengthen international cooperation and global partnerships for safe, orderly and \nregular migration. \n \n8  The African Migration Observatory is an organ of the African Union established pursuant to \ndecision Assembly/AU/Dec.695 (XXXI) of the Assembly of the African Union. \n\nProgress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum \nA/RES/76/266\n \n9/13\n22-08884 \n \nespecially Asians and people of Asian descent, as well as Africans and people of \nAfrican descent, and persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities remain \nwidespread, including misleading narratives that generate negative perceptions of \nmigrants, falsely associate migrants and diasporas with disease or criminal activities, \nheighten anti-immigrant sentiments and promote violence against migrants. \n50. The funding of the migration multi-partner trust fund has been insufficient to \nmeet the strong demand from Member States and stakeholders to support the \nimplementation of the Global Compact. \n \n \n \nRecommended actions to accelerate the implementation of the Global Compact \nand to strengthen international cooperation on international migration \n \n51. We commit to building on promising practices to harness the benefits of safe, \norderly and regular migration, including those that emerged in the response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, and to providing all migrants with safe access to basic services, \nregardless of their migration status, as well as continuity of care, COVID-19 \nvaccinations, testing and treatment in line with universal health coverage, to ensure \nthat no one is left behind in achieving the 2030 Agenda. In this context, we commit \nto promoting the meaningful participation of migrants in policy discussions on issues \naffecting them, including in the COVID-19 response and recovery. \n52. Building on the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and realizing \nthat there is a need to prepare for future health emergencies, we aim to integrate \npromising practices, consistent with the Global Compact and its guiding principles, \ninto migration policies. In this regard, we commit to accelerating efforts, at all levels, \nto integrate public health considerations into migration policies and incorporating the \nhealth needs of migrants in national and local health-care services, policies and plans, \nin ways which are transparent, equitable, non-discriminatory, people-centred, gender-\nresponsive, child-sensitive and disability-responsive, and which leave no one behind. \n53. Recognizing that migrants are integral to our societies, we commit to promoting \ntheir meaningful contribution to policy development, delivery and reviews, and \nrecommit to fostering inclusive and cohesive societies, by strengthening the provision \nof information, support and services, which contribute to migrants\u2019 integration. \n54. We commit to eliminating all forms of discrimination, including racism, systemic \nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, stigmatization, hate \nspeech, hate crimes targeting migrants and diasporas as well as negative stereotyping \nand misleading narratives that generate negative perceptions on migration and \nmigrants, including by reviewing, developing and implementing relevant legislation, \npolicies and practices and promoting evidence-based public discourse, inter alia in \npartnership with local authorities, migrants, diaspora communities and the media, \nbearing in mind the role of migrants as agents of sustainable development and as \nrights holders. We also commit to protecting freedom of expression in accordance \nwith international law, recognizing that an open and free debate contributes to a \ncomprehensive understanding of all aspects of migration. \n55. We commit to respecting, protecting and fulfilling the human rights and \nfundamental freedoms of all migrants, including those of women and children, \nregardless of their migration status, and to addressing international migration through \ninternational, regional or bilateral cooperation and dialogue and a comprehensive and \nbalanced approach, recognizing the roles and responsibilities of countries of origin, \ntransit and destination in promoting and protecting the human rights of all migrants \nand ensuring that their legislation and migration policies and practices are \nnon-discriminatory and consistent with their applicable international human rights \nobligations, in order to avoid approaches that might create or aggravate situations of \nvulnerability for migrants. \n\nA/RES/76/266 \nProgress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum \n \n22-08884\n10/13 \n \n56. We commit to developing national gender-responsive and child-sensitive \nmigration policies and legislation in line with relevant obligations under international \nlaw to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all migrant women and children, \nin particular girls, regardless of their migration status. In this regard, we stress the \nimportance of ensuring the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in the \nformulation and implementation of migration policies, while recognizing their \nindependence, agency and leadership. \n57. We commit to respecting, protecting and fulfilling the human rights of all \nmigrant children, regardless of their migration status, including unaccompanied or \nseparated migrant children, ensuring that the best interests of the child are a primary \nconsideration in all actions concerning children in our legislation, policies and \npractices, including those related to integration, return and family reunification. We \nwill consider, through appropriate mechanisms, progress and challenges in working \nto end the practice of child detention in the context of international migration. \n58. We will enhance international cooperation, especially by actions that accelerate \nthe realization of the 2030 Agenda, including the Sustainable Development Goals, \nthrough a revitalized Global Partnership for Sustainable Development, with the aim \nof eliminating the adverse drivers and structural factors that hinder people from \nbuilding and maintaining sustainable livelihoods and fulfilling their personal \naspirations, and so compel them to leave their country of origin. \n59. We will strengthen our efforts to enhance and diversify the availability of \npathways for safe, orderly and regular migration, including in response to demographic \nand labour market realities, and for migrants in vulnerable situations, as well as those \naffected by disasters, climate change and environmental degradation, including by \nworking coherently across all relevant multilateral forums, concluding labour mobility \nagreements, optimizing education opportunities, facilitating access to procedures for \nfamily reunification through appropriate measures that promote the realization of the \nright to family life and the best interests of the child, and regularizing migrants in an \nirregular situation, in line with national laws. In this regard, we commit to providing \nmigrants with access to information pertaining to their rights and obligations during \nall stages of migration, including information on fair and ethical recruitment, skills, \nqualifications, entry and exit requirements, living and working conditions, wages and \nbenefits, and access to justice and services, among others. \n60. We commit to strengthening our efforts to take legislative or other measures to \nprevent, combat and eradicate trafficking in persons, including forced labour, in the \ncontext of international migration, including by intensifying bilateral, regional and \ninternational cooperation to investigate, prosecute and penalize trafficking in persons. \nWe further commit to ensuring the effective identification, protection of and \nassistance to migrants who have become victims of trafficking in persons, not \nconditional upon cooperation with the authorities against suspected traffickers, \nincluding by providing access to gender-responsive and child-sensitive measures for \ntheir physical, psychological and social recovery and reintegration, facilitating access \nto justice, and avoiding the criminalization of migrants who are victims of trafficking \nin persons for trafficking-related offences. \n61. We commit to intensifying joint efforts, including through international \ncooperation between countries of origin, transit and destination, to prevent and \ncounter the smuggling of migrants, in full respect for human rights, by protecting the \nlives and human rights of migrants, ensuring safe and effective access to justice for \nmigrant victims of crime and ensuring that migrants do not become liable to criminal \nprosecution for the fact of having been the object of smuggling, notwithstanding \npotential prosecution for other violations of national law, as well as by combating the \n\nProgress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum \nA/RES/76/266\n \n11/13\n22-08884 \n \ncriminal activity and ending the impunity of smuggling networks, which put the lives \nof migrants at risk, and by enhancing pathways for safe, orderly and regular migration. \n62. We commit to strengthening our efforts to cooperate for safe and dignified return \nand to guaranteeing due process, individual assessment and effective remedy, \nincluding by upholding the prohibition of collective expulsion in accordance with our \nobligations under international human rights law, and to ensuring\u202fthat our nationals \nare duly received and readmitted,\u202fin full respect for the human right to return to one\u2019s \nown country and the obligation of States to readmit their own nationals, and we will \naccelerate our efforts so that returning migrants are assisted in their sustainable \nreintegration process through effective partnerships. \n63. We commit to enhancing cooperation to address violence, including sexual and \ngender-based violence, and harassment against women migrant workers in line with \nour obligations under international law and relevant labour standards, and to eliminate \nsituations of vulnerability for women migrant workers by promoting decent work, \nsuch as minimum wage policies, by facilitating safe and effective access to justice, \nand by protecting and supporting victims and survivors of all forms of violence, \nincluding harassment. \n64. Recognizing the foundational role of proof of legal identity in fulfilling the \nobjectives of the Global Compact, such as enhancing access to regular pathways, \npreventing and reducing statelessness and facilitating safe and dignified return, as \nwell as sustainable reintegration, we commit to accelerating efforts to ensure that all \nmigrants have proof of legal identity and adequate documentation and that our nationals \nhave non-discriminatory access to proof of nationality and other relevant documents, \nincluding by strengthening identification procedures and documentation systems, \nincluding through digitalization efforts, as well as consular capacities and cooperation, \nincluding through technical assistance and bilateral or regional agreements. \n65. We aim to develop and implement transparent, safe and predictable arrival \nprocedures on land and at sea for all migrants, including procedures for rescued \npeople, promoting responsibility-sharing in providing a place of safety, in accordance \nwith international law obligations at borders and along migratory routes, and to \ndevelop and implement procedures and agreements on search and rescue of migrants, \nwith the primary objective of protecting migrants\u2019 right to life, that uphold the \nprohibition of collective expulsion, guarantee due process and individual assessments, \nenhance reception and assistance capacities, and ensure that the provision of assistance \nof an exclusively humanitarian nature for migrants is not considered unlawful. \n66. We commit to continuing our efforts to facilitate the mutual recognition of \nformally and informally acquired skills and competencies acquired by migrants, \nincluding by issuing documents to this effect as appropriate, supporting the skilling \nand reskilling of migrants and returning migrants, promoting decent work \nopportunities, enhancing international cooperation to allow for the recovery of earned \nwages, benefits and entitlements of returning migrants, and promoting the sustainable \nreintegration of returning migrants by providing them with equal access to social \nprotection and services. \n67. We commit to redoubling our efforts to reduce the average transaction cost of \nmigrant remittances from 6.3 per cent of the amount transferred during the third \nquarter of 2021 to less than 3 per cent by 2030, including by adopting digital solutions \nfor faster, safer and cheaper remittances, promoting digital and financial inclusion \nand accelerating access to transaction accounts for migrants. \n68. We invite relevant subregional, regional and cross-regional processes, platforms, \ndialogues, forums and organizations, including the United Nations regional economic \ncommissions and regional consultative processes on migration, in reviewing the \n\nA/RES/76/266 \nProgress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum \n \n22-08884\n12/13 \n \nprogress made in the implementation of the Global Compact at all levels, to consider \nways to enhance cooperation related to its full implementation, in consultation with \nall relevant stakeholders and in line with a 360-degree vision. \n69. We will integrate migration as a cross-cutting issue in national development \nplans, development cooperation and other relevant frameworks, and through the \nvoluntary elaboration of ambitious and inclusive national implementation plans, in \nline with a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach, and expand \ninternational cooperation and partnerships to implement the vision of the Global \nCompact, including through financial and technical assistance to developing \ncountries, especially to African countries, least developed countries, landlocked \ndeveloping countries, small island developing States and middle-income countries. \n70. We request the Secretary-General, in his next biennial report, to propose, for the \nconsideration of Member States, a limited set of indicators, drawing on the global \nindicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and targets of the 2030 \nAgenda as contained in General Assembly resolution 71/313 of 6 July 2017 and other \nrelevant frameworks, to assist Member States, upon their request, in conducting \ninclusive reviews of progress related to the implementation of the Global Compact, \nas well as to include a comprehensive strategy for improving disaggregated migration \ndata at the local, national, regional and global levels. \n71. We commit to continuing to strengthen national capacities, including for data \ncollection, and international partnerships to realize the vision laid out in the Global \nCompact, including through the capacity-building mechanism, and we encourage \nMember States and stakeholders to submit good practices, lessons learned and \nchallenges to the Migration Network Hub Repository of Practices, and to consider \nmaking financial contributions to the migration multi-partner trust fund. \n72. We take note with appreciation of the efforts of the United Nations Network on \nMigration in strengthening enhanced system-wide coherence and guidance in support \nof the implementation of the Global Compact and the realization of our collective \ngoal of safe, orderly and regular migration and call upon the Network to cooperate \nwith Member States and relevant stakeholders to strengthen collaboration, peer \nlearning, engagement and linkages at the global, regional, national and local levels. \n73. Building on the pledging initiative of the Network, we welcome pledges made \nby Member States and relevant stakeholders in the lead-up to the Forum and \nencourage further pledges. We also request the Network to provide support to Member \nStates and relevant stakeholders in their implementation of their pledges, upon their \nrequest. We further encourage States to include these pledges and their implementation \nin their submissions of voluntary national reports. \n74. We commit to further aligning the implementation of relevant commitments and \nobjectives from the Global Compact with those under the 2030 Agenda, the Addis \nAbaba Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment,9 the Paris Agreement10 and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \nReduction 2015\u20132030 11 and relevant internationally agreed instruments and other \nexisting frameworks, as appropriate. \n75. We commit to strengthening the linkages between the Global Compact, the 2030 \nAgenda and their review forums and to giving due consideration to the progress, \nchallenges and gaps in implementing the Global Compact in the elaboration of our \nvoluntary national reviews of progress in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, as \n__________________ \n \n9  Resolution 69/313, annex. \n \n10  See FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21, annex. \n \n11  Resolution 69/283, annex II. \n\nProgress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum \nA/RES/76/266\n \n13/13\n22-08884 \n \nappropriate. We encourage the President of the Economic and Social Council to invite \nthe Coordinator of the United Nations Network on Migration to report on the linkages \nbetween the implementation of the Global Compact and the 2030 Agenda during the \nhigh-level political forum on sustainable development, and encourage relevant \nsubsidiary bodies of the General Assembly and of the Economic and Social Council, \nin accordance with their respective mandates, to contribute to the review of the \nimplementation of the Global Compact. \n76. We request the Secretary-General, with the support of the Network and other \nrelevant actors, to include actionable recommendations on strengthening cooperation \non missing migrants and providing humanitarian assistance to migrants in distress, \nincluding by collaborating with humanitarian actors, in his next biennial report, with \nthe aim of preventing loss of life in transit. \n77. We request the President of the General Assembly to hold a plenary meeting of \nthe General Assembly in the second half of 2024 in order to consider the next biennial \nreport of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the Global Compact, as well \nas the outcomes of the regional reviews, presented by the Coordinator of the Network, \nand for Member States and stakeholders to present, on a voluntary basis, progress in \nimplementing the pledges they have made in the context of the Forum. \n \n",

    "1": "We, the Heads of State and Government and High Representatives, meeting at United Nations Headquarters in New York from 17 to 20 May 2022 at the first International Migration Review Forum, convened under the auspices of the General Assembly, determined to enhance cooperation on international migration in all its dimensions, to discuss and share progress on the implementation of all aspects of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, 1 including as it relates to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 2 and with the participation of all relevant stakeholders, have adopted the following Progress Declaration. __________________ 1 Resolution 73/195, annex. 2 Resolution 70/1. A/RES/76/266 Progress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum 22-08884 2/13 Introduction",
    "2": "We reaffirm the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, also known as the Marrakech Compact on Migration, and recall General Assembly resolution 73/195 of 19 December 2018, by which it endorsed the Global Compact, as well as General Assembly resolution 73/326 of 19 July 2019 on the format and organizational aspects of the international migration review forums.",
    "3": "We also reaffirm that the Global Compact is based on a set of cross-cutting and interdependent guiding principles: people-centred, international cooperation, national sovereignty, rule of law and due process, sustainable development, human rights, gender-responsive, child-sensitive, whole-of-government approach and whole-of- society approach.",
    "4": "We are determined to fulfil the objectives and commitments outlined in the Global Compact, in line with its 360-degree vision, guiding principles and comprehensive approach, by facilitating safe, orderly and regular migration, promoting the contributions of migrants at all skills levels to sustainable development at the local, national, regional and global levels, within the framework of the 2030 Agenda, and reducing the incidence and negative impact of irregular migration.",
    "5": "We acknowledge our shared responsibilities to one another as Member States of the United Nations to respect each other\u2019s needs and concerns over migration, and we recognize that all migrants, regardless of their migration status, are human rights holders, and reaffirm the need to protect their safety and dignity, and the overarching obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, regardless of their migration status, without any kind of discrimination, while promoting the security, well-being and prosperity of all our communities.",
    "6": "We reaffirm the importance of international cooperation to facilitate safe, orderly and regular migration, including through the implementation of planned and well-governed migration policies in line with international law.",
    "7": "We recognize the positive role and contributions of migrants for inclusive growth and sustainable development in countries of origin, transit and destination, including by enriching societies through human, socioeconomic and cultural capacities.",
    "8": "We commend the positive role and contributions of millions of migrants in responding to and recovering from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, including as essential workers, and remain deeply concerned that the pandemic has had a severe and disproportionate impact on migrants, including through increased COVID-19 exposure, discrimination, violence, job losses, wage theft, protracted family separation, and restricted or lack of access to health-care services and other basic services, including vaccines, social protection, education and child services, and being subjected to unsafe and undignified returns.",
    "9": "We recognize that as many as 281 million people were international migrants in 2020 globally, of whom 48 per cent were women and girls and 15 per cent were under the age of 20, and that remittances are a critical source of support for families and communities, with migrants having transferred over 751 billion United States dollars in remittances in 2021 to their countries of origin.",
    "10": "We recognize the value and dignity of the labour of all migrant workers in all sectors, emphasizing the importance of promoting fair labour conditions and decent work and upholding international labour standards, and, in this regard, we also recognize the work of women migrant workers, including in paid and unpaid care work, domestic work and the informal economy, and emphasize the need to ensure that they are legally protected against violence, harassment and exploitation. Progress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum A/RES/76/266 3/13 22-08884",
    "11": "We are concerned that a growing number of migrant children, including those who are unaccompanied or separated from their parents or primary caregivers, are particularly vulnerable along their migration journey, and reaffirm our commitment to protecting the rights of the child and upholding the principle of the best interests of the child.",
    "12": "We are concerned about the impact of financial and economic crises, poverty, health emergencies and food insecurity on international migration and migrants, as well as sudden-onset and slow-onset natural disasters, the adverse effects of climate change, and environmental degradation, such as desertification, land degradation, drought, floods, water scarcity and sea level rise, taking into account the potential implications for migration and migrants.",
    "13": "We recognize the importance of creating conducive political, economic, social and environmental conditions for people to lead peaceful, productive and sustainable lives in their own country and to fulfil their personal aspirations, and, in this regard, declare our profound solidarity with and support for migrants caught up in situations of crisis in countries of transit and destination.",
    "14": "We reaffirm our collective responsibility to preserve the lives of all migrants and take action to prevent loss of migrant lives and, in this context, remain deeply concerned that thousands of migrants continue to die or go missing each year along perilous routes on land and at sea, in transit and destination countries, with reports of more than 8,436 migrants having lost their lives and 5,534 migrants having gone missing in transit globally from 2019 to 2021.",
    "15": "We condemn acts, manifestations and expressions of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against migrants and diasporas and the negative stereotypes often applied to them, including on the basis of religion or belief.",
    "16": "We are concerned about the risks, including for migrants, associated with irregular migration, smuggling of migrants and crimes against migrants, which continue to pose significant threats to the lives and well-being of migrants, and which require a concerted international assessment and response and strengthened multilateral cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination.",
    "17": "We take note with appreciation of the regional reviews of the implementation of the Global Compact and the reviews of progress at the national level, including, on a voluntary basis, the elaboration and use of national implementation plans and the mainstreaming of the Global Compact in plans and legislation, drawing on contributions from and the meaningful participation of all relevant stakeholders, including migrants, as well as parliaments and local governments, in line with a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach.",
    "18": "We recognize the work of the Global Compact Champion countries and the Friends of Migration group, including their initiative to share insights, lessons learned and promising practices in support of the implementation of the Global Compact, such as the Rabat Declaration adopted during the first ministerial meeting of the Champion countries on 25 March 2022.",
    "19": "We take note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General of 27 December 2021 on the implementation of the Global Compact, 3 and its guidance for the deliberations during the Forum, including policy priorities for consideration by the Forum.",
    "20": "We recognize the work of the United Nations Network on Migration in support of the implementation of the Global Compact, including the establishment of the __________________ 3 A/76/642. A/RES/76/266 Progress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum 22-08884 4/13 capacity-building mechanism, which comprises the migration multi-partner trust fund and the Migration Network Hub. Progress, challenges and gaps in the implementation of the Global Compact",
    "21": "We recognize the many efforts and the progress made and the good practices that have emerged in implementing the Global Compact and in realizing our collective goal of advancing safe, orderly and regular migration, and in the response to and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, by national and local governments, the United Nations system and other international and regional organizations, migrants, diasporas, civil society, local communities, migrant and diaspora organizations, faith- based organizations, academia, the private sector, parliamentarians, trade unions, national human rights institutions, the media, humanitarian actors, volunteers and other relevant stakeholders.",
    "22": "We are concerned that progress achieved in facilitating and harnessing the benefits of safe, orderly and regular migration is slow and uneven in many areas and that the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped many aspects of international migration and negatively impacted progress, and created new, and exacerbated existing situations of vulnerability for migrants. Greater efforts are needed by Member States to develop ambitious national responses for the implementation of the Global Compact. We recognize that challenges and gaps in the implementation of the Global Compact exist and may be due, in part, to limited resources and national capacities, as well as insufficient coordination within and between Governments, and with relevant stakeholders.",
    "23": "We recall that in General Assembly resolution 73/326, Member States decided to cover all 23 objectives of the Global Compact in four round tables during the Forum. Round table 1 (objectives 2, 5, 6, 12 and 18)4",
    "24": "Progress has been made in mainstreaming international migration into development plans and sectoral policies at the local, national, regional and global levels, as well as in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies and policies. Progress has also been achieved in the conclusion of bilateral and regional labour migration agreements, efforts to simplify administrative procedures related to migration and actions to prevent and reduce situations of vulnerability faced by migrants, in particular those in an irregular situation, including by facilitating their access to regular status, the formal economy, the labour market and basic services in line with national legislation. However, the availability and flexibility of pathways for regular migration remains limited in many cases.",
    "25": "Progress has been made by Member States, the private sector and other stakeholders in promoting fair and ethical recruitment and decent work for migrant workers, international labour standards, ensuring respect for and protection and fulfilment of human rights, and reducing or banning recruitment fees and strengthening labour inspection capacities. The use of digital technologies during the pandemic has increased, which contributed to the effectiveness and transparency of migration procedures, while also raising concerns about the digital divide for many __________________ 4 Objective 2: Minimize the adverse drivers and structural factors that compel people to leave their country of origin; objective 5: Enhance availability and flexibility of pathways for regular migration; objective 6: Facilitate fair and ethical recruitment and safeguard conditions that ensure decent work; objective 12: Strengthen certainty and predictability in migration procedures for appropriate screening, assessment and referral; objective 18: Invest in skills development and facilitate mutual recognition of skills, qualifications and competences. Progress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum A/RES/76/266 5/13 22-08884 migrants as well as challenges related to upholding migrants\u2019 right to privacy and the protection of personal data.",
    "26": "Progress has been achieved in facilitating recognition of academic and vocational qualifications and skills of migrant workers and returning migrants.",
    "27": "The adverse effects of climate change, environmental degradation and natural disasters are among the drivers of migration, which are influenced by economic, social, political and demographic contexts. Efforts to mitigate and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change have been insufficient, including in climate finance, as acknowledged by the twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and as part of the Glasgow Climate Pact. The responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative impact of climate change and systemic shocks have laid bare the gaps that remain in anticipating, preparing for and responding to events that might trigger large movements of migrants.",
    "28": "The lack of mutual recognition of skills and qualifications of migrants limits their potential, the benefits they can gain from their labour as well as their contributions to sustainable development, and leaves migrants vulnerable to exploitation. Many migrant workers, especially women migrant workers, continue to face precarious working conditions, wage theft, labour exploitation, reduced wages, discriminatory dismissals, withholding of benefits, forced unpaid leave and protracted separation from their families, which have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. In many cases, migration procedures lack predictability and allow for high levels of undue discretionary action, undermining the rule of law and due process.",
    "29": "The lack of access to quality education and economic opportunities, and inadequate investment as well as underdevelopment are among the key drivers that compel young people to leave their countries of origin in search of better opportunities. Therefore, it remains crucial to promote sustainable development, generate employment, bridge the digital divides and empower youth to fully participate in their societies. Round table 2 (objectives 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 21)5",
    "30": "Stakeholders have developed guidance for the development of transnational search mechanisms, promoting cross-border operational cooperation and information- sharing, and the establishment of other internationally coordinated efforts on missing migrants. Observatories have been established to collect migration data, and progress has been achieved in curbing the incidence of smuggling of migrants and in improving the capacity of Member States to identify networks of migrant smugglers and their organizers, and in identifying and responding to the needs of migrants in this regard.",
    "31": "There are increasing efforts by Member States to foster cross-border collaboration for the prevention of trafficking in persons, the investigation and prosecution of human traffickers, and to provide assistance and safe access to services to victims of trafficking in persons. Efforts are being made to modernize border-crossing points, including by simplifying procedures and upgrading infrastructure and equipment, to reduce immigration detention, including by implementing non-custodial alternatives __________________ 5 Objective 4: Ensure that all migrants have proof of legal identity and adequate documentation; objective 8: Save lives and establish coordinated international efforts on missing migrants; objective 9: Strengthen the transnational response to smuggling of migrants; objective 10: Prevent, combat and eradicate trafficking in persons in the context of international migration; objective 11: Manage borders in an integrated, secure and coordinated manner; objective 13: Use migration detention only as a measure of last resort and work towards alternatives; objective 21: Cooperate in facilitating safe and dignified return and readmission, as well as sustainable reintegration. A/RES/76/266 Progress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum 22-08884 6/13 to detention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some Member States have taken steps to end child immigration detention, advancing efforts to protect and respect the best interests of the child. In response to the challenges posed by the pandemic, some Member States temporarily suspended forced returns and expanded assistance to returning migrants. Some Member States have supported reintegration and recognized the opportunity to leverage the skills and knowledge acquired by returning nationals. Nevertheless, challenges remain in all of these areas.",
    "32": "Progress has been made in issuing migrants, including unaccompanied and separated children, with adequate documentation and civil registry documents. However, challenges remain regarding international cooperation on identification of nationals and issuance of travel documents, as many Member States still lack robust civil registration systems or the capacity to issue identity and travel documents. Migrants continue to face risks throughout the migration journey, owing to a lack of proof of legal identity, insufficient access to information or lack of predictability in migration procedures. Some policies, practices and conditions associated with immigration detention, including arbitrary deprivation of liberty, overcrowding and poor access to basic services have affected the physical and mental health and well- being of migrants, as well as child development.",
    "33": "Migrants continue to struggle to access and receive humanitarian assistance, including search and rescue efforts and medical care, which creates and exacerbates situations of vulnerability. Limited progress has been made in distinguishing the activities of smuggling networks from the provision of assistance of an exclusively humanitarian nature for migrants along perilous routes and in other situations where their life or safety is in danger. In many cases, the provision of such assistance has been considered unlawful.",
    "34": "Travel restrictions imposed by countries of origin, transit and destination as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic have created and exacerbated situations of vulnerability faced by migrants, and challenges for return and readmission, in many cases, including through insufficient efforts to manage national borders in an integrated, secure and coordinated manner that respects obligations under international law. In some cases, Member States have forcibly returned migrants with insufficient regard for health risks or due process and procedural safeguards, including the best interests of the child. Travel and other restrictions, including border closures and lockdowns, as well as capacity limitations, constrained the return and readmission of migrants who wished to return.",
    "35": "Safe and dignified return, readmission and sustainable reintegration in full compliance with international human rights law have proven to be difficult and complex in many cases. Conditions for more predictable travel have deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Limited progress has been made in enhancing bilateral and international cooperation to determine clear and mutually agreed procedures that uphold procedural safeguards and guarantee individual assessments and legal certainty.",
    "36": "Poverty, inequalities, economic exclusion and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, which have increased during the pandemic, are among the key risk factors of trafficking in persons, especially for women, children and young people. The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated access to, and the provision of, support to victims of trafficking in persons. In some instances, public health considerations were used to justify detention or unlawful deportation. Member States also faced practical challenges in ensuring alternatives to detention with full respect for human rights, particularly with regard to providing adequate living conditions and access to gender-responsive and people-centred services for migrants. Progress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum A/RES/76/266 7/13 22-08884 Round table 3 (objectives 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 and 22)6",
    "37": "In some cases, consular support has been strengthened through \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d virtual mechanisms, regional and subregional coordination and consular cooperation. The COVID-19 pandemic has also given rise to strengthened consular cooperation between States to protect their nationals and to assist them, including in the safe, voluntary and dignified return of migrants. Efforts have also been made in building the capacity of consular services. Several consular services implemented virtual service delivery to improve accessibility in the context of reduced in-person service.",
    "38": "Efforts to provide equal and safe access to affordable basic services, including access to health-care services and vaccines, to all migrants, regardless of their migration status, as well as efforts to provide all migrants with access to unemployment benefits and adequate social protection, without risk of arrest, detention and deportation in the context of international migration, have been essential in the effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular at the local level.",
    "39": "Progress was also made in promoting inclusion and social cohesion, including through language training and improved access to professional training, employment, education, and social inclusion and protection measures, as well as through community awareness campaigns, based on equality, non-discrimination and ways to promote mutual respect for the cultures, traditions and customs of communities of destination and of migrants, including acceptance of diversity.",
    "40": "Progress was achieved in the provision of health-care services, including mental health services, and psychosocial support and assistance to those impacted by the pandemic, including through efforts of diaspora networks and communities that set up humanitarian initiatives and digital platforms. Progress was also made in the recognition of the human, cultural, social and economic capital that diasporas bring, as well as their engagement and remittances in national development strategies, and in programmes to improve the financial inclusion and literacy of migrant workers and their families.",
    "41": "At the same time, many migrants and their families struggle to gain safe access to basic services, such as health-care services, despite being disproportionately exposed to COVID-19 owing to their living conditions and their employment in essential jobs. Migrants were often not systematically covered by COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccination policies and programmes as well as pandemic-related socioeconomic support and recovery measures, despite their loss of jobs and income. Safe access to basic services, social protection or recovery assistance often remained limited to migrants with a regular status, while migrants with irregular status remained in a situation of vulnerability.",
    "42": "Many countries declared remittances to be essential services and eased regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitated greater digitalization, offered incentives and abolished or waived transaction fees. However, the cost of transferring remittances remained at 6.3 per cent during the third quarter of 2021.",
    "43": "In addition to remittances remaining resilient, the pandemic has offered lessons to improve the remittance market, including by expanding the use of digital channels, promoting innovation, competition and transparency, reducing transaction costs and __________________ 6 Objective 14: Enhance consular protection, assistance and cooperation throughout the migration cycle; objective 15: Provide access to basic services for migrants; objective 16: Empower migrants and societies to realize full inclusion and social cohesion; objective 19: Create conditions for migrants and diasporas to fully contribute to sustainable development in all countries; objective 20: Promote faster, safer and cheaper transfer of remittances and foster financial inclusion of migrants; objective 22: Establish mechanisms for the portability of social security entitlements and earned benefits. A/RES/76/266 Progress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum 22-08884 8/13 increasing digital and financial inclusion. However, there is an uneven distribution across Member States of digital remittance channels, which depend on sound infrastructure and on digital and financial inclusion. Many migrants, in particular migrant women, lack access to financial services and mobile-enabled data, even though they often rely on receiving remittances to support themselves and their families.",
    "44": "Despite the fact that some Member States concluded and implemented bilateral and multilateral agreements to foster the portability of social security entitlements, coverage and portability of such entitlements remain limited owing to exclusion, barriers to eligibility, lack of implementation of existing frameworks and limited cross-border cooperation. Round table 4 (objectives 1, 3, 7, 17 and 23)7",
    "45": "Progress has been made in improving the collection and use of disaggregated migration data, including through the establishment of migration data and knowledge centres and observatories, such as the African Migration Observatory, 8 as well as the promotion of bilateral and regional exchanges and initiatives on migration data.",
    "46": "During the pandemic, many Member States, including local governments, as well as civil society organizations and other relevant stakeholders launched awareness- raising initiatives and translated COVID-19-related information into multiple languages to help to improve migrants\u2019 access to information and health-care services.",
    "47": "Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, some Member States have taken action to reduce situations of vulnerability for migrants, including by providing them, regardless of their migration status, with access to COVID-19-related and other health-care services and vaccinations, by extending visa and residence permits to avoid migrants falling into an irregular status, by halting forced returns and by establishing cross-border coordination mechanisms.
