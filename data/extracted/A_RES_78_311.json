bring new opportunities for \nsocioeconomic development and accelerate the progress and achievement of the \nSustainable Development Goals and sustainable development in its three dimensions \u2013 \neconomic, social and environmental \u2013 in a balanced and integrated manner, while \nrecognizing also that the improper or malicious design, development, deployment and \nuse of artificial intelligence systems, such as without adequate safeguards or in a \nmanner inconsistent with international law, could pose potential risks and challenges,  \n \nRecognizing that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including \nextreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge for sustainable development and an \nindispensable requirement for sustainable development,  \n \nStressing that artificial intelligence systems should be safe, secure and \ntrustworthy \u2013 whose life cycle includes the stages: pre-design, design, development, \nevaluation, \ntesting, \ndeployment, \nuse, \nsale, \nprocurement, \noperation \nand \ndecommissioning, are such that they are human-centric, reliable, explainable, ethical, \ninclusive, in full respect, promotion and protection of human rights and international \nlaw \u2013 in line with the principle of artificial intelligence for good for all, with the \nvision of a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented information society, \nbearing in mind that this resolution focuses on international cooperation on artificial \nintelligence capacity-building in the non-military domain and does not touch the \ndevelopment or use of artificial intelligence for military purposes,  \n \nEmphasizing that Member States should enjoy equal opportunities in the design, \ndevelopment, deployment, decommissioning and use of artificial intelligence, while \nrespecting intellectual property rights and promoting innovation,  \n \nNoting with concern that artificial intelligence and other digital divides between \nand within countries continue to widen, and developing countries face unique \nchallenges in keeping pace with the rapid acceleration of artificial intelligence \ndevelopment, in particular in terms of the design, development, deployment and use \nof artificial intelligence, thus stressing the need and urgency to narrow the disparities \nand assist developing countries in artificial intelligence capacity-building so that they \nwill not be further left behind,  \n \nNoting also with concern that actions inconsistent with international law and the \nCharter of the United Nations could hinder the development and innovation of \nartificial intelligence and global cooperation,  \n \nNoting both the positive benefits of open-source software, open models and \nopen data, among other methods and business models, in spreading the benefits of \nartificial intelligence, as well as the potential risks, and recognizing the importance \nof the participation of developing countries in relevant global cooperation,  \n \nRecognizing that the lack of digital infrastructure connectivity and skills, \nincluding education, expertise and human capacity, remains a fundamental challenge \nin many developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, which can \ncontribute to artificial intelligence and other digital divides, including different levels \nof readiness to make use of and benefit from artificial intelligence,  \n \nStressing the need and urgency to bridge artificial intelligence and other digital \ndivides between and within countries, and emphasizing the quality of access to the \nbenefits of artificial intelligence, therefore stressing the importance of providing \nadequate public and private financing, mobilizing action-oriented means of \nimplementation, such as knowledge sharing activities and the transfer of technology \non mutually agreed terms, and capacity-building assistance for developing countries \nin line with their national needs, policies
