Notes with concern the continuing high levels of unemployment and \nunderemployment, with 172 million people unemployed globally in 2018, a number \nthat is expected to increase to 174 million in 2020, recognizes that decent work for \nall remains one of the best routes out of poverty, and in this regard invites donor \ncountries, multilateral organizations and other development partners to continue to \nassist Member States, in particular developing countries, in adopting policies \nconsistent with the Global Jobs Pact adopted by the International Labour Conference \nat its ninety-eighth session;  \n \n14.

Reaffirms that, while social protection has proved to be effective in \nreducing poverty and inequality, including non-contributory social protection \nprogrammes and cash transfers, coverage remains extremely low in countries with the \nhighest poverty rates, also reaffirms that investments and innovation in the social \nsector, in particular in education and health, contribute to the alleviation of poverty \nand reduction of inequalities and enhance human resource development, and \nemphasizes the importance of ensuring that social protection systems and measures \nfor all, including floors, are consistent with national development strategies, well \ndesigned, efficiently operated, responsive to shocks and sustainable in the long term;  \n \n17. Stresses the importance of taking targeted measures to eradicate poverty \nin all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, of implementing \nnationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including social \nprotection floors, and of achieving substantial coverage of the poor and the \nvulnerable, and encourages Member States to continue to develop and implement \nsocial protection floors based on national priorities, paying particular attention to \nwomen, children, older persons, indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities;  \n \n18.

Stresses the importance of policies and actions that are not just gender-\nresponsive but that actively seek to advance the goal of gender equality and women\u2019s \nand girls\u2019 empowerment as well as to address longer-term structural issues, including \nstructural constraints faced by women as economic agents, and to remove any barriers \nthat prevent women from being full participants in the economy, by, inter alia, \nundertaking legislation and administrative reforms, as appropriate, to give women \nequal rights with men in political and economic decision-making and access to \neconomic resources and to promote the reconciliation of work and family \nresponsibilities, including through paid maternity and parental leave and the \nredistribution of the disproportionate work burden of women engaged in unpaid work, \nincluding domestic and care work, encourages the private sector, in accordance with \nnational legislation, to contribute to advancing gender equality by striving to ensure \nwomen\u2019s full and productive employment and decent work, equal pay for equal work \nor work of equal value and equal opportunities, as well as by protecting them against \ndiscrimination and abuse in the workplace, and underlines that globally, gross \ndomestic product could increase significantly if every country achieved gender \nequality and increased participation of women in the formal labour force;  \n \n24.
