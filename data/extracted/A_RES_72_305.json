It will \nalso coordinate the work of the subsidiary bodies of the Council, promoting a clearer \ndivision of labour among them, and the policies and activities of the specialized \nagencies relating to the Sustainable Development Goals and other internationally \nagreed development goals. The Secretary-General will present to the Council the \nannual overview report of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for \nCoordination.
