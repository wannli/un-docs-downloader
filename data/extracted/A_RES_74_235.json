Calls for closing the gender gap in access to financial and productive \nresources, including assets, information and services in agriculture, noting with \nconcern that the gender gap persists with respect to many assets, inputs and services, \nand stresses the need to invest in and strengthen efforts to empower women, in \nparticular rural women, to address their own food and nutritional needs and those of \ntheir families, to promote adequate standards of living for them, as well as decent \nconditions of work, and to promote their personal health, well-being and security, and \nguarantee their full access to land and natural resources and access to local, regional \nand global markets; \n \n14.

Stresses the need to take action to prevent and eliminate all forms of \nviolence and discrimination against women and girls, including in the world of work, \nthrough the strengthening of institutional mechanisms and legal frameworks, given \nthat violence and discrimination, including multiple and intersecting forms of \ndiscrimination, against women and girls in private and public spaces are a major \nimpediment to the achievement of the empowerment of women and girls and their \nsocial and economic development that no country has managed to eliminate, and \nencourages the adoption of specific preventive measures to protect women and girls, \nyouth and children from violence, abuse and neglect, sexual abuse, exploitation, \nharassment, trafficking in persons and harmful practices, such as child, early and \nforced marriage and female genital mutilation, taking into account the need to address \nnegative social norms, structural barriers and gender stereotypes that affect women in \nthe world of work and to develop measures to promote the re-entry of victims and \nsurvivors of violence into the labour market; \n \n17.

Also recognizes that achieving the highest attainable standard of physical \nand mental health, through, inter alia, equitable and universal access to affordable and \nquality health-care services and preventive health-care information, including in the \narea of sexual and reproductive health, is critical to women\u2019s economic advancement \nand empowerment, that a lack of economic empowerment and independence increases \nwomen\u2019s vulnerability to a range of negative consequences, including violence and \nthe risk of contracting HIV and AIDS, and that the neglect of women\u2019s full enjoyment \nof human rights severely limits their opportunities in public and private life, including \nthe opportunities for receiving an education and for achieving economic and political \nempowerment; \n \n19. Expresses deep concern that, globally, women and girls are still the most \naffected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, that they bear a disproportionate share of the \ncaregiving burden and that they are more vulnerable to violence, stigmatization, \ndiscrimination, poverty and marginalization from their families and communities as \na result of HIV/AIDS, notes that progress towards gender equality and the \nempowerment of all women and girls has been unacceptably slow and that the ability \nof women and girls to protect themselves from HIV continues to be compromised by \n__________________ \n \n20 World Health Organization, document EB136/8, annexes I and II. \n\nWomen in development \nA/RES/74/235\n \n9/17\n19-22508 \n \nphysiological factors, gender inequalities, including unequal power relations in \nsociety between women and men and boys and girls, and unequal legal, economic and \nsocial status, insufficient access to health-care services, including sexual and \nreproductive health, multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence in \nthe public and private spheres, including trafficking in persons, sexual violence, \nexploitation and harmful practices, and calls upon Governments and the international \ncommunity to urgently scale up responses towards achieving the goal of universal \naccess to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care and support and to ending \nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030; \n \n20. Urges Governments and all sectors of society to promote and pursue \ngender-based approaches to the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases \nbased on appropriately disaggregated data, including by sex and age, in their efforts \nto address the critical differences in the rapidly growing magnitude of \nnon-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic \nrespiratory diseases and diabetes, which affect people of all ages, gender, race and \nincome levels, as noted in the political declaration of the high-level meeting of the \nGeneral Assembly on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases,21 and \nnotes that people living in vulnerable situations, in particular in developing countries, \nbear a disproportionate burden and that non-communicable diseases can affect women \nand men differently, because, inter alia, women undertake an unequal share of \ncaregiving; \n \n21. Expresses deep concern that maternal health remains one area constrained \nby some of the largest health inequities in the world, and over the uneven progress in \nimproving newborn, child and maternal health, in this context calls upon States to \nimplement their commitments to prevent and reduce newborn, child and maternal \nmortality and morbidity, and in this regard takes note with appreciation of \ncommitments in support of the Global Strategy for Women\u2019s, Children\u2019s and \nAdolescents\u2019 Health (2016\u20132030), as well as national, regional and international \ninitiatives contributing to the reduction in the number of maternal deaths and deaths \nof the newborn and children under 5 years of age; \n \n22.

Expresses deep concern that the lack of adequate sanitation facilities and \nrelated challenges, such as water scarcity and unsafe water, disproportionately affect \nwomen and girls, including their labour force and school participation rates, and \nincrease their vulnerability to violence, and in this regard calls for the strengthening \nof efforts to achieve sanitation for all and to end open defecation, paying special \nattention to women and girls, through efforts to ensure access to sanitation and \nhygiene facilities, including menstrual hygiene management; \n \n24. Urges all Governments to eliminate discrimination against women and \ngirls in the field of education and to promote and respect their right to education, \nensure their safe and equal access to and encourage their participation in education, \nthroughout the life cycle and at all levels, especially for those who have been left \n__________________ \n \n21 Resolution 66/2, annex. \n\nA/RES/74/235 \nWomen in development\n \n19-22508\n10/17 \n \nfurthest behind, and address gender disparities, including by investing in public \neducation systems and infrastructure, eliminating discriminatory laws and practices, \nproviding universal access to inclusive and equitable quality education, including free \nand compulsory primary and secondary education, promoting lifelong learning \nopportunities for all, eliminating female illiteracy and promoting financial and digital \nliteracy, ensuring that women and girls have equal access to career development, \ntraining, scholarships and fellowships, adopting positive actions to build women\u2019s \nand girls\u2019 leadership skills and influence and supporting women and girls in \ndiversifying their educational and occupational choices in emerging fields, such as \nscience, \ntechnology, \nengineering \nand \nmathematics \nand \ninformation \nand \ncommunications technology, to strive to ensure the completion of early childhood, \nprimary and secondary education and expand vocational and technical education for \nall women and girls, and foster, as appropriate, intercultural and multilingual \neducation for all, and to address negative social norms and gender stereotypes in \neducation systems, including in curricula and teaching methodologies, that devalue \ngirls\u2019 education and prevent women and girls from having access to, completing and \ncontinuing their education; \n \n25.
