the 1850 to 1900 baseline,  \n \nNoting with concern also that the World Meteorological Organization, in its \nState of the Global Climate 2023, highlighted that the past nine years, from 2015 to \n2023, were the nine warmest on record, and in 2023 ocean heat content reached its \nhighest recorded level and global mean sea level reached a record high, while the \nworld also continued to see increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and ocean \nacidification, and the cryosphere continued its contraction,  \n \nExpressing concern that climate change continues to increase the severity and \nincidence of coral bleaching throughout tropical seas and weakens the ability of reefs \nto withstand ocean acidification, which could have serious and irreversible negative \neffects on marine organisms, particularly corals, as well as to withstand other \npressures, including overfishing and pollution, \n\nOceans and the law of the sea \nA/RES/79/144\n \n5/59\n24-23832 \n \n \nReiterating

charting are critical to \nthe safety of navigation and life at sea, environmental protection, including the \nprotection of vulnerable marine ecosystems, and the economics of the global shipping \nindustry, and encouraging further efforts towards electronic charting, which not only \nprovides significantly increased benefits for safe navigation and management of ship \nmovement, but also provides data and information that can be used for sustainably \nmanaged fisheries and sustainably managed aquaculture activities and other sectoral \nuses of the marine environment, the delimitation of maritime boundaries and \nenvironmental protection, and noting that, under the International Convention for the \nSafety of Life at Sea, 1974,13 ships on international voyages are required to carry
