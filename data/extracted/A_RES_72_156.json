Reaffirms that such acts may be qualified as falling within the scope of the \nConvention, that they may not be justified when they fall outside the scope of the \nrights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association as well as the rights to \nfreedom of expression and that they may fall within the scope of article 20 of the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and may be subject to certain \nrestrictions, as set out in articles 19, 21 and 22 of the Covenant;  \n \n15.

Condemns without reservation any denial of or attempt to deny the \nHolocaust, as well as any manifestation of religious intolerance, incitement, \nharassment or violence against persons or communities on the basis of ethnic origin \nor religious belief;  \n \n17.

Calls upon States to continue to take adequate steps, including through \nnational legislation, in accordance with international human rights law, aimed at the \nprevention of hate speech and incitement to violence against persons in vulnerable \nsituations and, where necessary, to consider reviewing national anti-racism legislation \nin the light of the increasingly open expression of hate speech and incitement to \nviolence against such persons; \n \n19. Expresses deep concern about attempts at commercial advertising aimed \nat exploiting the sufferings of the victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity \ncommitted during the Second World War by the Nazi regime;  \n \n20. Stresses that the practices described above do injustice to the memory of \nthe countless victims of crimes against humanity committed in the Second World War, \nin particular those committed by the SS organization and by those who fought against \nthe anti-Hitler coalition and collaborated with the Nazi movement, and may \nnegatively influence children and young people, and that failure by States to \neffectively address such practices is incompatible with the obligations of States \n__________________ \n \n13  United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1125, No. 17512. \n \n14  A/72/291, para. 91. \n\nCombating glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fuelling \ncontemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance \nA/RES/72/156\n \n5/9 \n17-22963 \n \nMembers of the United Nations under its Charter, including those related to the \npurposes and principles of the Organization;  \n \n21. Also stresses that all such practices fuel contemporary forms of racism, \nracial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the spread \nand multiplication of various extremist political parties, movements and groups, \nincluding neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and in this regard calls for increased \nvigilance;  \n \n22. Expresses concern that the human rights and democratic challenges posed \nby extremist political parties, movements and groups are universal and no country is \nimmune to them;  \n \n23. Emphasizes the need to take the measures necessary to put an end to the \npractices described above, and calls upon States and all other stakeholders to take \nmore effective measures in accordance with international human rights law to prevent \nand combat those phenomena and extremist movements, which pose a real threat to \ndemocratic values, and to increase their vigilance and be proactive in strengthening \ntheir efforts to recognize and effectively address those challenges; \n \n24. Underlines the importance of data and statistics on racist and xenophobic \ncrimes for identifying the types of offences committed, the profiles of victims and of \nperpetrators and whether the latter are affiliated with extremist movements or groups, \nthus enhancing better understanding of the phenomenon and identifying effective \nmeasures to address such racist and xenophobic crimes, and recalls in this regard the \ncommitments made in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 15 on data, \nmonitoring and accountability, including collecting disaggregated data; \n \n25. Encourages States to adopt further measures to provide training for the \npolice and other law enforcement bodies on the ideologies of extremist political \nparties, movements and groups whose advocacy constitutes incitement to racist and \nxenophobic violence, to strengthen their capacity to address racist and xenophobic \ncrimes, to fulfil their responsibility for bringing to justice the perpetrators of such \ncrimes and to combat impunity;  \n \n26. Expresses deep concern about the increased number of seats occupied by \nrepresentatives of extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character in a number of \nnational and local parliaments, and emphasizes in this regard the need for all \ndemocratic political parties to base their programmes and activities on respect for \nhuman rights and freedoms, democracy, the rule of law and good governance and to \ncondemn all messages disseminating ideas that are based on racial superiority or \nhatred and that have the objective of fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial \ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  \n \n27. Notes with appreciation, in this regard, the call of the Special Rapporteur \nupon political leaders and parties to strongly condemn incitement to racial \ndiscrimination or xenophobia, to promote tolerance and respect and to refrain from \nforming coalitions with extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character;16 \n \n28. \nExpresses concern that ethnic profiling and police violence against persons \nin vulnerable situations discourage victims from seeking redress owing to distrust of \nthe legal system, and in this regard encourages States to improve diversity within law \nenforcement agencies and to impose appropriate sanctions against those within the \npublic service found guilty of racially motivated violence or of using hate speech; \n \n29. Expresses deep concern about the increase in reported cases of racist and \nxenophobic manifestations during sports events, including those committed by \n__________________ \n \n15  Resolution 70/1. \n \n16  A/72/291, para. 83. \n\nA/RES/72/156 \nCombating glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fuelling \ncontemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance\n \n17-22963 \n6/9 \n \nextremist groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and calls upon States, \nsports federations and other relevant stakeholders to strengthen measures to prevent \nsuch incidents, while also welcoming the steps that many States, sports federations \nand clubs have taken to eliminate racism at sporting events, including through sport \npractised without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which require \nhuman understanding, tolerance, inclusion, fair play and solidarity; \n \n30. Recalls the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur to introduce into \nnational criminal law a provision according to which committing an offence with \nracist or xenophobic motivations or aims constitutes an aggravating circumstance, \nallowing for enhanced penalties,17 and encourages those States whose legislation does \nnot contain such provisions to consider that recommendation; \n \n31. Notes measures taken by States to prevent discrimination against, in \nparticular but not limited to, persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and \nlinguistic minorities, people of African descent, Roma, migrants, refugees and asylum \nseekers, and to ensure their integration into society, urges States to ensure the full and \neffective implementation of legal, policy and institutional measures protecting these \nindividuals and groups, and recommends that States effectively guarantee to these \nindividuals and groups, without discrimination of any kind, their human rights, \nincluding the right to safety and security, access to justice, adequate reparation and \nappropriate information about their rights, as well as the prosecution and adequate \npunishment of those responsible for racist and xenophobic crimes against them, \nincluding the right to seek reparation or satisfaction for damages suffered as a result \nof such crimes; \n \n32. Underlines that the roots of extremism are multifaceted and must be \naddressed through adequate measures such as education, awareness-raising and the \npromotion of dialogue, and in this regard recommends the increase of measures to \nraise awareness among young people of the dangers of the ideologies and activities \nof extremist political parties, movements and groups;  \n \n33. Reaffirms, in this regard, the particular importance of all forms of \neducation, including human rights education, as a complement to legislative \nmeasures, and calls upon States to continue to invest in education, in both \nconventional and non-conventional curricula, inter alia, in order to transform attitudes \nand counteract ideas of racial hierarchies and superiority, and counter their negative \ninfluence, and to promote the values of non-discrimination, equality and respect for \nall, as outlined by the Special Rapporteur;  \n \n34. Recognizes the paramount role of education in combating racism, racial \ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, especially in promoting the \nprinciples of tolerance, inclusion and respect for ethnic, religious and cultural \ndiversity and preventing the spread of extremist racist and xenophobic movements \nand ideas; \n \n35. Emphasizes the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur presented at \nthe sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, in which he emphasized the \nimportance of history classes in teaching the dramatic events and human suffering \nwhich arose out of the adoption of ideologies such as Nazism and Fascism; 18  \n \n36. Stresses the importance of other positive measures and initiatives aimed at \nbringing communities together and providing them with space for genuine dialogue, \nsuch as round tables, working groups and seminars, including training seminars for \nState agents and media professionals, as well as awareness-raising activities, \n__________________ \n \n17  A/69/334, para. 81. \n \n18  A/64/295, para. 104. \n\nCombating glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fuelling \ncontemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance \nA/RES/72/156\n \n7/9 \n17-22963 \n \nespecially those initiated by civil society representatives, which require continued \nState support;  \n \n37.

Reaffirms article 4 of the Convention, according to which States parties \ncondemn all propaganda and all organizations which are based on ideas or theories of \nsuperiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or which \nattempt to justify or promote racial hatred and discrimination in any form, and \nundertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to eradicate all \nincitement to, or acts of, such discrimination and, to this end, with due regard to the \nprinciples embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1 and the rights \nexpressly set forth in article 5 of the Convention, inter alia:  \n \n(a) \nShall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based \non racial superiority or hatred, and incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all \nacts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of \nanother colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist \nactivities, including the financing thereof;  \n \n(b) \nShall declare illegal and prohibit organizations, and also organized and all \nother propaganda activities, which promote and incite racial discrimination, and shall \nrecognize participation in such organizations or activities as an offence punishable by \nlaw;  \n \n(c) \nShall not permit public authorities or public institutions, national or local, \nto promote or incite racial discrimination;  \n \n39. Also reaffirms that, as underlined in paragraph 13 of the outcome \ndocument of the Durban Review Conference, any advocacy of national, racial or \nreligious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence \nshould be prohibited by law, that all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority \nor hatred, or incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or \nincitement to such acts, shall be declared offences punishable by law, in accordance \nwith the international obligations of States, and that these prohibitions are consistent \nwith freedom of opinion and expression;  \n \n40. Recognizes the positive role that the exercise of the right to freedom of \nopinion and expression, as well as full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and \nimpart information, including through the Internet, can play in combating racism, \nracial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  \n \n41. Expresses concern about the increased use of the Internet to promote and \ndisseminate racism, racial hatred, xenophobia, racial discrimination and related \nintolerance, and in this regard calls upon States parties to the International Covenant \non Civil and Political Rights to counter the dissemination of the above-mentioned \nideas while respecting their obligations under articles 19 and 20 of the Covenant, \nwhich guarantee the right to freedom of expression and outline the grounds on which \nthe exercise of this right can be legitimately restricted; \n \n42.
