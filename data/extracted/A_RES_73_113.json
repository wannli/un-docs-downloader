aspirations of the people of \nGuam require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for self-\ndetermination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, size of \npopulation or natural resources,  \n \nConvinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should \ncontinue to guide the development of their future political status and that \nreferendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an \nimportant role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  \n \nConcerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the \nTerritories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world economy and \nby the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that are \ncontrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to \nresolution 1514 (XV),  \n \nConvinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must \ntake place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory,

America as the administering \nPower and to receive information from other appropriate sources, including the \nrepresentatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the people \nof the Territory,  \n \nAware of the importance both to Guam and to the Special Committee of the \nparticipation of elected and appointed representatives of Guam in the work of the \nCommittee,  \n

their inalienable right to self-determination and in \ngaining a better understanding of the options for self-determination, on a case-by-\ncase basis,  \n \nMindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the \nCaribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of \nrepresentatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for \nthe Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the \nseminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element \nin the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of \nthe Territories,  \n \nWelcoming the Pacific regional seminar on the theme \u201cImplementation of the \nThird International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: towards the achievement \nof the Sustainable Development Goals \u2013 social, economic and environmental \nchallenges\u201d, held by the Special Committee in

of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies \nof the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,  \n \nNoting the ruling7 of a federal court in the United States, the administering \nPower, holding that a plebiscite on self-determination could not be limited to native \ninhabitants, which has brought the plebiscite to a halt, and noting also that there is an \nongoing appeals process, \n \nNoting also the statement made by a representative of the Governor of Guam at \nthe 2018 Pacific regional seminar, at which participants received updates highlighting \nthe continuing financial challenges faced by the Territory and the efforts made to \nadvance self-determination, including those endeavours made by the Guam \nCommission on Decolonization for the Implementation and Exercise of Chamorro \nSelf-Determination through the education campaign,  \n \nCognizant of the efforts made by the Guam Commission on Decolonization to \npromote in the Territory the holding of a plebiscite on self-determination and to \nadvance its education campaign on each of the three political status options, and \nrecalling that more than 11,000 native inhabitants have been registered in the Guam \ndecolonization registry to vote in the plebiscite,  \n \nNoting, in this regard, the statement by a representative of the Governor of \nGuam at the 2018 Pacific regional seminar that, while the case on the plebiscite had \nput a strain on native rights and the ability to choose the political future of the people \nof Guam, Guam would continue to move forward in pursuing self-determination, \n \nRecalling that the administering Power approved a grant to support the self-\ndetermination education campaign in the Territory in March 2016,  \n \nRecalling also that, in a referendum held in 1987, the registered and eligible \nvoters of Guam endorsed a draft Guam Commonwealth Act that would establish a \nnew framework for relations between the Territory and the administering Power, \nproviding for a greater measure of internal self-government for Guam and recognition \nof the right of the Chamorro people of Guam to self-determination for the Territory,  \n \nAware that negotiations between the administering Power and the territorial \nGovernment on the draft Guam Commonwealth Act ended in 1997 and that Guam has \nsubsequently established a non-binding plebiscite process for a self-determination \nvote by the eligible Chamorro voters,  \n \nCognizant of the importance of the administering Power continuing to implement \nits programme of transferring surplus federal land to the Government of Guam,  \n__________________ \n \n5  Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-third Session, Supplement No. 23 (A/73/23). \n \n6  See
