Global drowning prevention \n \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nReaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled \u201cTransforming \nour world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d, in which it adopted a \ncomprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative \nSustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for \nthe full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating \npoverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest \nglobal challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, and \nits commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions \u2013 \neconomic, social and environmental \u2013 in a balanced and integrated manner, to \nbuilding upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking \nto address their unfinished business, and to leaving no one behind, \n \nReaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa \nAction Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, \nwhich is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports \nand complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with \nconcrete policies and actions and reaffirms the strong political commitment to address \nthe challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels for \nsustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity,  \n \nRecalling its resolution 71/222 of 21 December 2016, entitled \u201cInternational \nDecade for Action, \u2018Water for Sustainable Development\u2019, 2018\u20132028\u201d, and its \nresolution 73/226 of 20

\n21-05668\n2/4 \n \nSocial Council resolution 1980/67 of 25 July 1980 on international years and \nanniversaries,  \n \nRecalling its resolution 74/2 of 10 October 2019, by which it adopted the \npolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage, entitled \n\u201cUniversal health coverage: moving together to build a healthier world\u201d, in which it \nrecognized the need to scale up efforts to address the growing burden of injuries and \ndeaths, including those related to drowning, through preventive measures as well as \nemergency response as part of integrated health-care delivery,  \n \nRecalling also World Health Assembly resolution 64.27 of 24 May 2011, \nentitled \u201cChild injury prevention\u201d,1 and recognizing that drowning is a leading global \ncause of injury-related child deaths that requires preventive measures, including \nawareness-raising,  \n \nDeeply concerned that drowning has been the cause of over 2.5 million \npreventable deaths in the past decade, but has been largely unrecognized relative to \nits impact,  \n \nRecognizing the association between drowning and development, and noting \nthat over 90 per cent of deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, with Africa \nrecording the world\u2019s highest drowning rates and Asia carrying the highest burden of \ndrowning deaths by number,  \n \nNoting that drowning is a social equity issue that disproportionately affects \nchildren and adolescents in rural areas, with many countries reporting drowning as \nthe leading cause of childhood mortality and drowning being among the 10 leading \ncauses of death globally for 5- to 14-year-olds,  \n \nNoting with concern that the official global estimate of 235,000 deaths per \nannum excludes drownings attributable to flood-related climatic events and water \ntransport incidents, resulting in the underrepresentation of drowning deaths by up to \n50 per cent in some countries,  \n \nRecognizing that drowning prevention can increase societal resilience, and \nnoting that drownings affect not only littoral nations but frequently occur in rivers, \nlakes, domestic water storage and swimming pools in many other countries, \n \nUnderlining the relevance of major global frameworks, including the Paris \nAgreement,2 the New Urban Agenda3 and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \nReduction 2015\u20132030,4 for addressing climate change and reducing disaster risk, \nnoting that water-related disasters increasingly affect millions of people globally \nowing in part to the escalating adverse impacts of climate change and that flooding \naffects more people than any other natural hazard, with drowning being the main \ncause of death during floods, and noting also the importance of national adaptation \nplanning to address these risks, \n \nObserving that drowning prevention would contribute to the delivery of the \n2030 Agenda, most notably that drowning prevention represents an effective measure \ncontributing to the prevention of child deaths and can protect investment in child \ndevelopment,  \n \nNoting the significant progress made by some Member States with regard to \npolicy and programming interventions to prevent or reduce the incidence of drowning \nas a cause of death,  \n__________________ \n \n1  See World Health Organization, document
