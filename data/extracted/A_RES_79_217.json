that remittance flows constitute sources of private capital, \ncomplement domestic savings and are instrumental in improving the well-being of \nrecipients, bearing in mind that remittances cannot be considered a substitute for \nforeign direct investment, official development assistance, debt relief or other public \nsources of financing for development,  \n \nRecognizing the potential of remittances to reduce poverty, increase access to \neducation, health and improved housing, promote financial inclusion and increase the \ninflow of foreign currency, as well as ensure food supplies, improve the sustainability of \nfood production systems, create better job opportunities and promote sustainable practices \nin rural areas, positively contributing to the sustainable development of countries,  \n \nWelcoming the fact that many countries declared remittances to be essential \nservices and eased regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitated greater \ndigitalization, offered incentives and abolished or waived transaction fees, expressing \nconcern that, nonetheless, the cost of transferring remittances remained at 6.3 per cent \nduring the second quarter of 2022, far above the Sustainable Development Goal target \nof 3 per cent or lower, and expressing concern also at the continued decline in \ncorrespondent banking relationships, due to de-risking trends, and

\nthat the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped many aspects of international migration and \nnegatively impacted progress, and created new, and exacerbated existing situations of \nvulnerability for migrants,  \n \nNoting with concern that highly trained, skilled and professional workers from \ndeveloping countries continue to emigrate at an increasing rate to certain countries, \nand recognizing in this regard the importance of investing in human capital \ndevelopment by promoting entrepreneurship, education, vocational training and skills \ndevelopment programmes and partnerships, and productive employment creation, in \nline with labour market needs, with a view to reducing youth unemployment, avoiding \nbrain drain and optimizing brain gain in countries of origin, and harnessing the \ndemographic dividend,  \n \nExpressing concern about the impact of financial and economic crises, poverty, \nhealth emergencies and food insecurity on international migration and migrants, as \nwell as sudden-onset and slow-onset natural disasters, the adverse effects of climate \nchange and environmental degradation, such as desertification, land degradation, \ndrought, floods, water scarcity and sea level rise, taking into account the potential \nimplications for migration and migrants,  \n \nExpressing concern also about ongoing and escalating humanitarian \nemergencies, which may potentially have an impact on various aspects of \ninternational migration, including by reducing access to opportunities for safe, \norderly and regular migration, disrupting the flow of remittances and exacerbating \nexisting vulnerabilities of migrants and their families,  \n\nInternational migration and development \nA/RES/79/217\n \n5/10\n24-24338 \n \n \nRecalling the determination of Member

regional and global levels, within the framework of the 2030 \nAgenda, and reducing the incidence and negative impact of irregular migration,  \n \nRecalling also that the Global Compact is based on a set of cross-cutting and \ninterdependent guiding principles: people-centred, international cooperation, national \nsovereignty, rule of law and due process, sustainable development, human rights, \ngender-responsive, child-sensitive, whole-of-government approach and whole-of \nsociety approach,  \n \nRecalling further the importance of the decent work agenda of the International \nLabour Organization, including for migrant workers, the 10 fundamental Conventions \nof that Organization, as well as the Global Jobs Pact adopted by the International \nLabour Conference at its ninety-eighth session as a general framework within which \neach country can formulate policy packages specific to its situation and national \npriorities in order to promote a job-intensive recovery and sustainable development,  \n \nRecognizing the valuable contribution of the Global Forum on Migration and \nDevelopment to addressing the multidimensional nature of international migration \nand promoting balanced and comprehensive approaches and dialogue on migration \nand development, and acknowledging that it has proved to be a valuable forum for \nholding frank and open discussions, including through multi-stakeholder dialogues, \nand that it has helped to build trust among participating stakeholders through the \nexchange of experiences and good practices and by virtue of its voluntary, \nintergovernmental, non-binding and informal character and the engagement of civil \nsociety actors as well as the private sector, noting in this regard the convening of the \nfourteenth summit of the Global Forum, in 2024, and looking forward to the fifteenth \nsummit of the Global Forum, to be held in 2025,  \n \nRecognizing also the role of Governments at all levels, including

well-being of migrants,  \n \nAcknowledging the important and complex interrelationship between \ninternational migration and development and the need to deal with the challenges and \nopportunities that migration presents to countries of origin, transit and destination, \nrecognizing that migration brings benefits and challenges to the global community, \nand confirming the importance of including the matter in relevant debates and \ndiscussions held at the global, regional and national levels, as appropriate, including \nat the level of the United Nations and other international

Nations, to cover international migration in all its dimensions;  \n \n6. \nRecognizes the positive contribution of migrants to inclusive growth and \nsustainable development and that international migration is a multidimensional reality \nof major relevance for the development of countries of origin, transit and destination, \nwhich requires coherent and comprehensive responses and balanced approaches, and \nalso recognizes that international migration is a cross-cutting phenomenon that no \none State can manage on its own and that calls for global approaches and global \nsolutions, as well as the integration of sustainable development, with due regard for \nsocial, economic and environmental dimensions, and that should be addressed in a \nbalanced manner through a whole-of-government approach and with respect for \nhuman rights;  \n \n7. \nAcknowledges the complexity of migratory flows and that international \nmigration movements also occur within the same geographical regions, and in this \ncontext calls for a better understanding of migration patterns across and within \nregions, regardless of the level of development; \n \n8. \nRecognizes that, in a demographically diverse world, population \ndynamics, including differences in the pace of population growth or decline, changing \npopulation age structures, urbanization and international migration, will continue to \nshape the world for present and future generations, and in this regard encourages \ncountries that rely on migrant workers to plan for future labour market needs, \nincluding by promoting investments and strengthening partnerships to address decent \nwork deficits and to promote skills development and training in countries of origin \nand destination alike; \n \n9. \nAlso recognizes the importance of strengthening joint analysis and sharing \nof information to better map, understand, predict and address migration movements, \nsuch as those that may result from

protection and \nfulfilment of the human rights of all migrants; \n \n10. Further recognizes that the lack of access to quality education and \neconomic opportunities, and inadequate investment as well as underdevelopment are \namong the key drivers that compel young people to leave their countries of origin in \nsearch of better opportunities, and therefore that it remains crucial to promote \nsustainable development, generate employment, bridge all digital divides and \nempower youth to fully participate in their societies; \n\nInternational migration and development \nA/RES/79/217\n \n7/10\n24-24338 \n \n \n11. \nEncourages the international community to invest in higher productivity \nsectors, including advanced technologies and the digital economy, to support the \nclosing of digital divides through a more inclusive digital transformation, to increase \nlocal opportunities and to provide skilled, better paying jobs in countries of origin \nand reduce brain drain; \n \n12.
