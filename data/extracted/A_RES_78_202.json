or trade measures not in accordance with international law and \nthe Charter of the United Nations that impede the full achievement of economic and \nsocial development, particularly in developing countries, \n \nExpressing concern about the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures \non international relations, trade, investment and cooperation, \n \nRecognizing that unilateral coercive measures disproportionally affect people in \nvulnerable situations, and in this regard expressing grave concern that, in some \ncountries, the situation of children is adversely affected by unilateral measures not in \naccordance with international law and the Charter that create obstacles to trade \nrelations among States, impede the full realization of social and economic \ndevelopment and hinder the well-being of the population in the affected countries, \nwith particular consequences for women, children, including adolescents, the elderly \nand persons with disabilities, \n \nDeeply concerned that, despite the recommendations adopted on this question \nby the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council, the Commission on Human \nRights and recent major United Nations conferences, and contrary to general \ninternational law and the Charter, unilateral coercive measures continue to be \npromulgated and implemented, with all their negative implications for the social

of society, including on livelihoods, food security and nutrition, \nand education, the exacerbation of poverty and hunger, disruption to economies, \ntrade, societies and environments, and the exacerbation of economic and social \ninequalities within and among countries, \n \nRecognizing also that the poorest and those who may be vulnerable or in \nvulnerable situations, within and among countries, are the hardest hit by the pandemic \nand that the impact of the crisis has reversed hard-won development gains and \nhampered progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as \nprogress with regard to the realization of the right to development, \n__________________ \n \n22  Resolution 41/128, annex. \n\nA/RES/78/202 \nHuman rights and unilateral coercive measures\n \n23-26033\n4/8 \n \n \nDeeply concerned about the situation of States facing both unilateral coercive \nmeasures, which are not in accordance with international law or the Charter, and the \nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and recognizing that such States have to \novercome additional obstacles derived from the application of unilateral coercive \nmeasures in order to respond to and recover from the pandemic, \n \nRecognizing the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures, which are not \nin accordance with international law or the Charter, on global efforts to respond to \nand recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and on the capacities of targeted countries \nto have equal access to safe, quality, efficacious, effective, accessible and affordable \nvaccines and other means to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, \n \nConcerned about the fact that the frequency, type, target and scope of \napplication of unilateral coercive measures, which are not in accordance with \ninternational law or the Charter, have expanded enormously in the international arena, \n \nRecalling article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on Civil \nand Political Rights 23  and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and \nCultural Rights,24 which provides, inter alia, that in no case may a people be deprived \nof its own means of subsistence, \n \nNoting the continuing efforts of the open-ended Working Group on the Right to \nDevelopment of the Human Rights Council, and reaffirming in particular its criteria, \naccording to which unilateral coercive measures are one of the obstacles to the \nimplementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development, \n \n1. \nUrges all States to cease adopting or implementing any unilateral measures \nnot in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter \nof the United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations \namong States, in particular those of a coercive nature, with all their extraterritorial \neffects, which create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus impeding the full \nrealization of the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and \nother international human rights instruments, in particular the right of individuals and \npeoples to development; \n \n2. \nStrongly urges States to refrain from promulgating and applying any \nunilateral economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance with international \nlaw and the Charter that impede the full achievement of sustainable economic and \nsocial development, particularly in developing countries; \n \n3. \nCondemns the inclusion of Member States in unilateral lists under false \npretexts, which are contrary to international law and the Charter, including false \nallegations of terrorism sponsorship, considering such lists as instruments for political \nor economic pressure against Member States, particularly developing countries; \n \n4. \nUrges all States not to adopt any unilateral measures not in accordance \nwith international law and the Charter that impede the full achievement of economic \nand social development by the population of the affected countries, in particular \nchildren and women, that hinder their well-being and that create obstacles to the full \nenjoyment of their human rights, including the right of everyone to a standard of \nliving adequate for his or her health and well-being and his or her right to food, \nmedical care and education and the necessary social services, as well as to ensure that \nfood and medicine are not used as tools for political pressure; \n \n5. \nStrongly objects to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in \naddition, threaten the sovereignty of States, and in this context calls upon all Member \n__________________ \n \n23  See resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex. \n \n24  Ibid. \n\nHuman rights and unilateral coercive measures \nA/RES/78/202\n \n5/8\n23-26033 \n \nStates neither to recognize those measures nor to apply them, as well as to take \nadministrative or legislative measures, as appropriate, to counteract the \nextraterritorial applications or effects of unilateral coercive measures; \n \n6. \nCondemns the continuing unilateral application and enforcement by \ncertain Powers of unilateral coercive measures, and rejects those measures, with all \ntheir extraterritorial effects, as being tools for political or economic pressure against \nany country, in particular against developing countries, adopted with a view to \npreventing those countries from exercising their right to decide, of their own free will, \ntheir own political, economic and social systems, and because of the negative effects \nof those measures on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their \npopulations, in particular children, women, the elderly and persons with disabilities; \n \n7. \nExpresses grave concern that, in some countries, the situation of children \nis adversely affected by unilateral measures not in accordance with international law \nand the Charter that create obstacles to trade relations among States, impede the full \nrealization of social and economic development and hinder the well-being of the \npopulation in the affected countries, with particular consequences for women, \nchildren, including adolescents, the elderly and persons with disabilities; \n \n8. \nReaffirms that essential goods such as food and medicines, including \nvaccines, should not be used as tools for political coercion, in particular in the context \nof global health challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and that under no \ncircumstances should people be deprived of their own means of subsistence and \ndevelopment; \n \n9. \nAlso reaffirms its resolution 74/274 of 20 April 2020, in which it \nrecognized the importance of international cooperation and effective multilateralism \nin helping to ensure that all States have in place effective national protective \nmeasures, access to and flow of vital medical supplies, medicines and vaccines, in \norder to minimize negative effects in all affected States and to avoid relapses of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic; \n \n10. Recognizes the role of extensive immunization against COVID-19 as a \nglobal public good for health in preventing, containing and stopping transmission in \norder to bring the pandemic to an end, through safe, quality, efficacious, effective, \naccessible and affordable vaccines for all, including countries affected by unilateral \ncoercive measures, which are not in accordance with international law or the Charter; \n \n11. \nRecalls the appeal made by the Secretary-General, on 26 March 2020, on \nthe waiving of sanctions that undermine countries\u2019 capacity to respond to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and the statement made by the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Human Rights, on 23 March 2020, on the need to ease or suspend \nsectoral sanctions in the light of their potentially debilitating impact on the health \nsector and human rights; \n \n12. Reaffirms its commitment to international cooperation and multilateralism \nand its strong support for the central role of the United Nations system in the global \nresponse to and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic; \n \n13. Emphasizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the short- and long-\nterm impacts of unilateral coercive measures, which are not in accordance with \ninternational law or the Charter, on the enjoyment of all categories of civil, economic, \nsocial and cultural rights; \n \n14. Calls upon Member States that have initiated such measures to abide by \nthe principles of international law, the Charter, the declarations of the United Nations \nand world conferences and relevant resolutions and to commit themselves to their \nobligations and responsibilities arising from the international human rights \n\nA/RES/78/202 \nHuman rights and unilateral coercive measures\n \n23-26033\n6/8 \n \ninstruments to which they are parties by revoking such measures at the earliest \npossible time; \n \n15. Reaffirms, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, by \nvirtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their \neconomic, social and cultural development; \n \n16. Recalls that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International \nLaw concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with \nthe Charter of the United Nations, contained in the annex to General Assembly \nresolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, and the relevant principles and provisions \ncontained in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, proclaimed by the \nAssembly in its resolution 3281 (XXIX), in particular article 32 thereof, no State may \nuse or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to \ncoerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its \nsovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind; \n \n17. Rejects all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, and urges \nthe Human Rights Council to take fully into account the negative impact of those \nmeasures, including through the enactment and extraterritorial application of national \nlaws that are not in conformity with international law, in its task concerning the \nimplementation of the right to development; \n \n18. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in \ndischarging his functions relating to the promotion, realization and protection of the \nright to development and bearing in mind the continuing impact of unilateral coercive \nmeasures on the population of developing countries, to give priority to the present \nresolution in his annual report to the General Assembly; \n \n19. Underlines the fact that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major \nobstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and \nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 25 and in this regard calls upon all \nStates to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the \nextraterritorial application of national laws that run counter to the principles of free \ntrade and hamper the development of developing countries, as recognized by the \nopen-ended Working Group on the Right to Development of the Human Rights \nCouncil; \n \n20. Recognizes that, in the Declaration of Principles adopted at the first phase \nof the World Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva from 10 to \n12 December 2003, 26  States were strongly urged to avoid and refrain from any \nunilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the \nUnited Nations in building the information society; \n \n21. Reaffirms paragraph 30 of the outcome document of the United Nations \nsummit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, entitled \n\u201cTransforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d, in which \nStates are strongly urged to refrain from promulgating and applying any unilateral \neconomic, financial or trade measures not in accordance with international law and \nthe Charter of the United Nations that impede the full achievement of economic and \nsocial development, particularly in developing countries; \n \n22.

Recalls that the Human Rights Council took note of the research-based \nprogress report of its Advisory Committee containing recommendations on \nmechanisms to assess the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the \nenjoyment of human rights and to promote accountability;29 \n \n27. Also recalls the contribution of the first biennial panel discussion on the \nissue of unilateral coercive measures and human rights organized by the Human \nRights Council in 2015 to increase awareness of the negative impact that unilateral \ncoercive measures have on the enjoyment of human rights in the targeted and \nnon-targeted countries, and invites the Council to follow up on the discussion at the \nfourth panel discussion, in 2021; \n \n28.
