biomass, coal and kerosene for cooking and heating, \nwith disproportionate health and workload impacts on women, children and people in \nvulnerable situations, including an estimated 4 million premature deaths annually, \nthat, while the global population without access to electricity has fallen below \n1 billion, close to 760 million people are still without access to electricity, that \nreliability and affordability remain challenges in many countries, even as the number \nof household connections increases, that Africa accounts for more than half of both \naccess figures and that, even when energy services are available, millions of poor \npeople are unable to pay for them,  \n \nNoting with concern that energy represents less than 1 per cent of overall United \nNations expenditure on the Sustainable Development Goals, despite its critical \nimportance also in achieving other goals, \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety

\n21-19271\n4/10 \n \ndigital services to connect people, share information and facilitate education, and \nfurther recognizing that ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and \nmodern energy for all contributes to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and the \nimplementation of other relevant intergovernmentally agreed frameworks in the \neconomic, social and environmental fields, and that reaching Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 7 by the end of decade requires an urgent and steep rise in \ninvestment in and financing of affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy \nand energy efficiency, while noting that the unprecedented crisis caused by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic will have serious impacts on progress towards fulfilling the \ncommitment on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern \nenergy for all by 2030, and economic disruptions related to the COVID-19 crisis have \nmade it even harder for developing countries to reach Goal 7, with the largest decline \nin energy investment on record in 2020, noting the announcement of Governments \naiming to achieve net-zero emissions, taking note of the findings, in the report of the \nSecretary-General,13 to put the world on track to reaching this objective, and noting \nthe Group of 20 ministerial meeting on energy, hosted by Saudi Arabia on 27 and \n28 September 2020, and the
