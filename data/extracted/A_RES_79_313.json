Tackling illicit trafficking in wildlife \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nReaffirming its resolutions 69/314 of 30 July 2015, 70/301 of 9 September 2016, \n71/326 of 11 September 2017, 73/343 of 16 September 2019, 75/311 of 23 July 2021 \nand 77/325 of 25 August 2023 on tackling illicit trafficking in wildlife, \n \nReaffirming also its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled \n\u201cTransforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d, by which \nit adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and \ntransformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, \n \nReaffirming further the intrinsic value of biological diversity and its various \ncontributions to sustainable development and human well-being, and recognizing that \nwild fauna and flora in their many beautiful and varied forms are an irreplaceable part \nof the natural systems of the Earth which must be protected for this generation and \nthe generations to come, \n \nSeriously concerned about the rate of species extinctions, as indicated in the \nfindings of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and \nEcosystem Services, and stressing the urgent need to address the unprecedented \nglobal decline in biodiversity, including by preventing the extinction of threatened \nspecies, to improve and sustain their conservation status and to restore and safeguard \necosystems that provide essential functions and services, including services related to \nwater, health, livelihoods and well-being, \n \nRemaining concerned, therefore, about the increasing scale of poaching and \nillegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products and its adverse economic, social and \nenvironmental impacts, \n\nA/RES/79/313 \nTackling illicit trafficking in wildlife\n \n25-10883\n2/12 \n \n \nExpressing serious concern over the detrimental levels of rhinoceros poaching, \nthe high levels of killings of elephants in Africa and the high levels of illicit pangolin \ntrafficking, as well as the illegal trade in other protected wildlife species, including \nbut not limited to tortoises, marine and freshwater turtles, land and marine iguanas, \nother reptiles, sharks, seahorses, the European eel, ornamental fish, great apes, \nparrots, songbirds, raptors, the helmeted hornbill and big cats, including the snow \nleopard and the jaguar, and plants such as orchids and succulents, and trees such as \nthe Brazil wood, which threaten those species with local extinction and, in some cases, \nwith global extinction, \n \nNoting with concern that, in addition to long-established illicit markets, new \nillicit markets are constantly emerging and pushing other species into the endangered \ncategory, such as the Philippine forest turtle and the pancake tortoise, owing to the \nillegal pet trade, \n \nRecognizing that rapid and profound socioecological changes, among other \nfactors, such as degradation and unsustainable use of ecosystems, loss of habitats, \ninvasive alien species and poorly managed wildlife trade drive the risk of a large-\nscale species extinction and biodiversity loss, threaten the vital contributions that \nnature makes to people and their livelihoods and increase the likelihood of zoonotic \ndiseases emerging and spreading among wildlife, livestock and other domestic \nanimals, which consequently increases the risk of pathogens spreading from animals \nand humans, leading to zoonotic disease outbreaks, epidemics and, in extreme cases, \npandemics, \n \nRecognizing also that illicit trafficking in live wild animals and bushmeat does \nnot adhere to sanitary regulations and avoids quarantine controls on import, and can \ntherefore increase the probability of novel infections among trafficked animals and \nrepresents an increased risk for transmitting zoonotic diseases, with the potential to \nnegatively impact human and animal health, \n \nDetermined to reduce the risks for future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, which \nmay lead to epidemics and, in extreme cases, pandemics and their devastating impact \non human health and livelihoods, and recognizing that curbing illicit wildlife \ntrafficking and conserving and restoring biodiversity and functioning ecosystems can \ncontribute not only to reducing the risk of emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases, \nbut also to reducing possible threats to human health and economic development, \n \nRecognizing that human, animal, plant and ecosystem health are interdependent, \nand therefore emphasizing that biodiversity and health linkages should be addressed \nholistically, recalling in this regard the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity \nFramework, adopted in decision 15/4 of 19 December 2022,1 as well as decision 15/29 \nof 19 December 2022 2  of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on \nBiological Diversity and resolutions 5/1 3 and 5/64 of 2 March 2022 of the United \nNations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme, \n \nUnderlining the need to take measures to combat illicit trafficking in wildlife, \nespecially timber, including illegal harvesting of timber and associated trade, which \nleads to the decimation of rare timber species, in particular of rosewood, agarwood, \nsandalwood and Brazil wood, and noting the high volume of rosewood imports \nderived from illegal sources and the need to prevent illegally harvested timber from \nbeing laundered along global supply chains, in line with national legislation,

\nA/RES/79/313\n \n3/12\n25-10883 \n \nincluding, where applicable, through traceability systems, financial investigations and \nenhanced national enforcement capacities, \n \nRecognizing that illicit trafficking in wildlife contributes to the extinction of \nmany species and damage to ecosystems and rural livelihoods, including those based \non ecotourism, undermines good governance and the rule of law and, in some cases, \nthreatens national stability and requires enhanced transnational and regional \ncooperation and coordination in response, \n \nRecognizing also the importance of addressing the root causes of illicit wildlife \ntrafficking as a complement to law enforcement efforts, including through, inter alia, \ndemand reduction, sustainable livelihoods and poverty eradication, \n \nEmphasizing that the protection of wildlife must be part of a comprehensive \napproach to achieving poverty eradication, food security, sustainable development, \nincluding the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, economic \ngrowth, social well-being and sustainable livelihoods, \n \nEmphasizing also, in this regard, the need to develop context-specific solutions \nfor the sustainable and resilient coexistence of humans and wildlife, both within and \noutside protected areas, with the aim of contributing to the improvement of \nlivelihoods and to conservation efforts, as well as the need to effectively manage \nhuman-wildlife interactions to minimize human-wildlife conflict for coexistence, \n \nRecalling its resolution 61/295 of 13 September 2007, entitled \u201cUnited Nations \nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\u201d, recognizing that respect for \nIndigenous traditional practices contributes to sustainable and equitable development \nand proper management of the environment, and recognizing also the essential \nengagement role of Indigenous Peoples and local communities to ensure a sustainable \nsolution to addressing the illegal wildlife trade, \n \nReaffirming its call for holistic and integrated approaches to sustainable \ndevelopment that will guide humanity to live in harmony with nature and lead to \nefforts to restore the health and integrity of the Earth\u2019s ecosystem, which will \ncontribute to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and achievement of the \nSustainable Development Goals for the common future of present and coming \ngenerations, \n \nSeriously concerned at the increased use of online intermediaries, in countries \nof origin and destination of illicit trafficking in wildlife, including social media \nplatforms and online marketplaces, including those on the dark web that facilitate and \ndrive the trafficking in wildlife and wildlife products, highlighting the necessity for \nrelevant private sector actors to proactively step up their compliance with regulatory \nrequirements in the fight against trafficking in wildlife, and recognizing the need to \ndevelop and utilize relevant techniques to counter illicit wildlife trafficking online, \nrecognizing in this regard the need for enhanced technical and digital capacity-\nbuilding, in particular for developing countries, \n \nConcerned about the persistent use of forged or illegally issued permits and \ncertificates or the fraudulent use of authentic permits and certificates in order to \nmisuse domestic legal markets to mask trade in illegally obtained wildlife or wildlife \nproducts, or to launder such illegally obtained wildlife or wildlife products, and \nconcerned also about the facilitating role of corruption in this regard, \n \nRecognizing the legal framework provided by and the important role of the \nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 5 \nas the primary mechanism for regulating international trade in species of wild fauna \n_______________ \n \n5 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 993, No. 14537. \n\nA/RES/79/313

World Cultural and Natural Heritage 8  and the Convention on \nWetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat, 9 \n \nRecalling Economic and Social Council resolution 2013/40 of 25 July 2013 on \ncrime prevention and criminal justice responses to illicit trafficking in protected \nspecies of wild fauna and flora, in which the Council encouraged Member States to \nmake illicit trafficking in protected species of wild fauna and flora involving \norganized criminal groups a serious crime, \n \nNoting that wildlife trafficking is a lucrative form of transnational organized \ncrime and can be linked to other forms of transnational organized crime, and noting \nwith concern the role that corruption can play in facilitating illicit trafficking in \nwildlife and wildlife products, \n \nReaffirming that the United Nations Convention against Transnational \nOrganized Crime10 and the United Nations Convention against Corruption11 constitute \neffective tools and an important part of the legal framework for international \ncooperation in fighting and preventing illicit trafficking in wildlife, \n \nBearing in mind that the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and their \ndiversion and other forms of transnational organized crime can be linked to illicit \ntrafficking in wildlife, which may pose a serious threat to national and regional \nstability in some parts of Africa and other regions of the world, \n \nRecognizing the important work of the International Consortium on Combating \nWildlife Crime (ICCWC), a collaborative effort of the
