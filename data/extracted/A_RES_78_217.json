and recovery from the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic, including as essential workers, and remaining deeply concerned \nthat the pandemic has had a severe and disproportionate impact on migrants, including \nthrough increased COVID-19 exposure, discrimination, violence, job losses, wage theft, \nprotracted family separation, and restricted or lack of access to health-care services and \nother basic services, including vaccines, social protection, education and child services, \nand mental health, and being subjected to unsafe and undignified returns,  \n \nRecognizing also the positive role and contributions of migrants for inclusive \ngrowth and sustainable development in countries of origin, transit and destination, \nincluding by enriching societies through human, socioeconomic and cultural capacities, \n \nUnderlining the importance of the Human Rights Council in promoting respect \nfor the protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all, including \nmigrants,  \n \nRecognizing that women represent almost half of all international migrants, in this \nregard recognizing also that the positive contribution of women migrant workers has the \npotential to foster inclusive growth and sustainable development in countries of origin, \ntransit and destination, underlining the value and dignity of their labour in all sectors, \nincluding in care and domestic work, and encouraging efforts to improve public \nperceptions of migrants and migration, \n \nConcerned that gender-based violence, in particular against migrant women, is \nrooted in historical and structural inequalities in power relations between women and \nmen, which further reinforces gender stereotypes and barriers to the full enjoyment \nby all migrant women and girls of their human rights,  \n \nAcknowledging the cultural and economic contributions made by migrants to \ntheir communities of origin and destination and the need to identify appropriate means \nof maximizing development benefits, to respond to the challenges that migration \nposes to countries of origin, transit, and destination, to promote dignified, humane \ntreatment with applicable protections and access to basic services, and to strengthen \nmechanisms for international cooperation,  \n \nRecognizing that migration can increase social, cultural and economic ties \nbetween nations and can be facilitated by agreements within regional integration \nprocesses to reinforce education exchange, labour mobility and the portability of \napplicable social security entitlements and earned benefits of migrant workers,  \n \nEmphasizing the multidimensional character of international migration, the \nimportance of international, regional and bilateral cooperation and dialogue in this \nregard, as appropriate, and the need to protect the human rights of all migrants, \nparticularly at a time when migration flows, both within and across regions, have \nincreased in the globalized economy and take place in a context of continued security \nconcerns,  \n \nRecognizing that large movements of migrants have political, economic, social, \ndevelopmental, humanitarian and human rights ramifications that call for global \napproaches and global solutions, that no one State can manage on its own,  \n \nDeeply concerned at the large and growing number of migrants, especially \nwomen and children, including those unaccompanied or separated from their parents, \nwho find themselves in a vulnerable situation when crossing or attempting to cross \ninternational borders, and recognizing the obligation of States to respect the human \nrights of those migrants in accordance with their applicable international human rights \nobligations, and reaffirming the

orderly and regular migration, including in response \nto demographic and labour market realities,  \n \nRecognizing the need to ensure that returned migrants are duly received and \nreadmitted, in accordance with States\u2019 obligation not to arbitrarily deprive their \nnationals of the right to enter their own country and the obligation of States to readmit \ntheir own nationals, \n \nRecognizing also the importance of coordinating international efforts to provide \nadequate protection, assistance and support to migrants in vulnerable situations and, \nas appropriate, facilitate their voluntary, safe and dignified return to their countries \nof origin or procedures for determining the need for international protection while \nrespecting the principle of non-refoulement,  \n \nBearing in mind the obligations of States under international law, as applicable, \nto exercise due diligence to prevent crimes targeting migrants and to investigate and \npunish perpetrators, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the \nenjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of victims,  \n \nExpressing concern that migrants continue to struggle to access and receive \nhumanitarian assistance, including search and rescue efforts and medical care, which \ncreates and exacerbates situations of vulnerability,  \n \nReaffirming its commitment to preserve the

go missing \neach year along perilous routes on land and at sea,  \n \nStressing the importance of all regulations and laws regarding irregular \nmigration, at all levels of government, being in accordance with the obligations of \nStates under international law, including international human rights law,  \n \nExpressing concern at and condemning the increasing trend of acts, \nmanifestations and expressions of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \nrelated intolerance and hostility towards migrants and diasporas in societies, and the \nnegative stereotypes often applied to them, including on the basis of religion or belief, \nall of which has a negative impact on the fulfilment of human rights globally,  \n \nStressing the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants \nregardless of their migration status, including when implementing their specific \nmigration and border security policies, and expressing its concern at measures which, \nincluding in the context of policies aimed at reducing irregular migration, treat \nirregular migration as a criminal rather than an administrative offence, where the \neffect of doing so is to deny migrants the full enjoyment of their human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, and in this regard recalling that sanctions and the treatment \ngiven to irregular migrants should be commensurate with their offences, \n \nAware that, as criminals take advantage of migratory flows and attempt to \ncircumvent restrictive immigration policies and border controls, migrants become \nmore vulnerable to, inter alia, kidnapping, extortion, forced labour, sexual \nexploitation, physical assault, debt bondage and abandonment,  \n \nAware also that employing border governance policies that do not respect human \nrights and are in violation of a State\u2019s obligations under international law, and that \nare failing to combat widespread impunity for those who violate the human rights of \nmigrants, contributes to limit pathways for safe, orderly and regular migration and \n\nA/RES/78/217 \nProtection of migrants\n \n23-25999\n6/14 \n \ncan contribute to the death or disappearance of migrants, particularly those in \nvulnerable situations,  \n \nRecognizing the human, cultural, social and economic capital that diasporas \nbring, as well as their engagement and remittances in national development strategies, \nand in programmes to improve the financial inclusion and literacy of migrant workers \nand their families,  \n \nAcknowledging that remittance flows constitute sources of private capital, \ncomplement domestic savings and are instrumental in improving the well-being of \nrecipients, bearing in mind that remittances cannot be considered a substitute for \nforeign direct investment, official development assistance, debt relief or other public \nsources of financing for development,  \n \nRecognizing the positive contributions of young migrants to countries of origin \nand destination, and in that regard encouraging States to consider the specific \ncircumstances and needs of young migrants,  \n \nConcerned that a growing number of migrant children, including those who are \nunaccompanied or separated from their parents or primary caregivers, are particularly \nvulnerable along their migration journey, and reaffirming the commitment to protecting \nthe rights of the child and upholding the principle of the best interests of the child, \n \nRecognizing the obligations of countries of origin, transit and destination under \ninternational human rights law, as well as the need to adopt a comprehensive and \nintegral approach to migration policies, to facilitate safe, orderly, regular and \nresponsible migration and mobility of people, in accordance with their relevant \nobligations under international human rights law, and, as applicable, consistent with \ntheir commitments in the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, \n \nUnderlining the importance for States, in cooperation with civil society, \nincluding non-governmental organizations, workers\u2019 organizations and the private \nsector, among other relevant stakeholders, to undertake information campaigns aimed \nat clarifying opportunities, limitations, laws, risks and rights in the event of migration \nin order to enable everyone to make informed decisions and to prevent anyone from \nutilizing irregular or dangerous means to cross international borders,  \n \n1. \nCalls upon States to promote and protect effectively the human rights and \nfundamental freedoms of all migrants, regardless of their migration status, especially \nthose of women and children, and to address international migration through \ninternational, regional or

avoid \napproaches that might aggravate their vulnerability;  \n \n2. \nExpresses its concern about the impacts of financial and economic crises, \nas well as natural disasters and the effects of

families, \nand to facilitate fair and ethical recruitment; \n \n3. \nCalls upon Member States to develop coherent approaches to address the \nchallenges of migration movements in the context of sudden-onset and slow-onset \nnatural disasters, including by taking into consideration relevant recommendations \nfrom State-led consultative processes, such as the Agenda for the Protection of Cross-\nBorder Displaced Persons in the Context of Disasters and Climate Change, and the \nPlatform on Disaster Displacement; \n\nProtection of migrants \nA/RES/78/217\n \n7/14\n23-25999 \n \n \n4.

on the basis of religion or belief, and \nurges States to apply and, where needed, to reinforce existing laws when hate crimes, \nxenophobic or intolerant acts, manifestations or expressions against migrants occur, \nin order to eradicate impunity for those who commit those acts and, where \nappropriate, to provide effective remedy to the victims; \n \n(b) \nEncourages States to establish or,
