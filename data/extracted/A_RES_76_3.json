Agenda \n \n \nI. \nIntroduction \n \n1. \nThe United Nations has been at the centre of international cooperation in space \nactivities since the beginning of the space age. The Committee on the Peaceful Uses \nof Outer Space came into being as a result of the recognition by the General Assembly, \nin its resolution 1348 (XIII) of 13 December 1958, of the importance of using outer \nspace for peaceful purposes and of the need to promote international cooperation in \nthe conduct of space activities; in its resolution 1472 A (XIV) of 1959, the Assembly \npermanently established the Committee. \n2. \nOwing to its unique mandate and position at the centre of international \ncooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, and the global governance of outer \nspace activities,1 consistent with international law, the Committee played a key role \nin the organization of the first three United Nations conferences on the exploration \nand peaceful uses of outer space, held in 1968, 1982 and 1999.  \n__________________ \n \n1 See A/AC.105/1137. \n\nA/RES/76/3 \nThe \u201cSpace2030\u201d Agenda: space as a driver of \nsustainable development\n \n21-15518\n2/10 \n \n3. \nFifty years after the first United Nations Conference on the Exploration and \nPeaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE), States Members of the United Nations \nand representatives of the international space community gathered in Vienna on \n20 and 21 June 2018 for the high-level segment of the fiftieth anniversary of the first \nUnited Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space \n(UNISPACE+50) to reflect on more than 50 years of achievement in space exploration \nand use and to strengthen global cooperation in outer space and the use of outer space \nfor sustainable development. \n4. \nThe General Assembly, in its resolution 73/6 of 26 October 2018, noted with \nappreciation that the preparatory process and the high-level segment of \nUNISPACE+50 had resulted in documents aimed at articulating a comprehensive, \ninclusive and strategically oriented vision on strengthening international cooperation \nin the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space, in which space was seen as a \nmajor driver of and contributor to the achievement of the Sustainable Development \nGoals for the benefit of all countries. \n5. \nIn that regard, the General Assembly invited the Committee to continue to \ndevelop, on the basis of the results of the UNISPACE+50 process, a \u201cSpace2030\u201d \nAgenda and implementation plan and to provide the General Assembly with the \noutcome of its work for consideration by the Assembly at its seventy-fifth session, in \n2020. \n6. \nThe \u201cSpace2030\u201d Agenda and implementation plan is submitted by the \nCommittee to the General Assembly as a forward-looking strategy for reaffirming and \nstrengthening the contribution of space activities and space tools to the achievement \nof global agendas, 2  addressing long-term sustainable development concerns of \nhumankind. It also contributes to charting the future contribution of the Committee \nto the framework for the global governance of outer space activities, consistent with \ninternational law.  \n \n \nII. \nStrategic vision \n \n7. \nWe, the States Members of the United Nations, acknowledge that the exploration \nand peaceful uses of outer space have enriched our collective knowledge and \nrevolutionized life on Earth. Space science and technology are now intrinsic to our \ndaily lives and bring an abundance of unique and fundamental benefits to Earth. As \nthe space community moves forward with its space exploration endeavours, space \nwill continue to serve as a source of inspiration and innovation and to provide \napplications for the benefit of humankind. \n8. \nWe emphasize that space tools are highly relevant for the attainment of the \nglobal development agendas, in particular the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment and its goals and targets, either directly, as enablers and drivers of \nsustainable development, or indirectly, by providing essential data for the indicators \nused to monitor the progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and the Sendai \nFramework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030 and the commitments by States \nparties to the Paris Agreement. The fulfilment of these global agendas requires \nimproved access to space-based data and applications and space infrastructure, taking \ninto account the particular needs of developing countries. \n9. \nWe acknowledge the distinguished historical record of the Committee on the \nPeaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Legal Subcommittee and Scientific and \nTechnical Subcommittee in the establishment and further development of the \ninternational legal regime governing outer space activities. Under that regime, outer \n__________________ \n \n2 The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \nReduction 2015\u20132030 and the Paris Agreement. \n\nThe \u201cSpace2030\u201d Agenda: space as a driver of \nsustainable development \nA/RES/76/3\n \n3/10\n21-15518 \n \nspace activities of States, international intergovernmental organizations and \nnon-governmental entities are flourishing, and as a result, space science and \ntechnology and their applications are contributing immeasurably to economic growth \nand improvements in the quality of life worldwide. \n10. We reaffirm the unique role of the Committee, and its subcommittees, supported \nby the Office for Outer Space Affairs, as unique platforms for international \ncooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, for the \nglobal governance of outer space activities, consistent with international law, for \ndeveloping international space law, for fostering dialogue among spacefaring and \nemerging space nations, and for promoting the increased involvement of all countries \nin space activities, including through capacity-building initiatives. \n11. \nWe underscore the importance of the Outer Space Treaty as the cornerstone of \nthe international legal regime governing outer space activities. It contains the \nfundamental principles of international space law and will continue to provide an \nindispensable framework for the conduct of outer space activities. The \nuniversalization and effective implementation of the Outer Space Treaty should be \npromoted. \n12. We encourage the Committee to continue to coordinate efforts to strengthen the \nimplementation of the United Nations treaties and principles on outer space and to \ncomplement existing international space law, when appropriate, to respond to \nemerging issues. The Committee and its subcommittees should continue to \ndemonstrate their relevance and address current and emerging challenges and \nopportunities, such as the long-term sustainability of outer space activities. \n13. We commit to addressing changes in the undertaking of outer space activities at \na time when new technologies have emerged and when an increasing number of \nparticipants, representing both governmental agencies and non-governmental entities, \nincluding industry and the private sector, are becoming involved in ventures to \nexplore and use space and carry out space activities. In that regard, we commit to \nensuring that the Committee, and its subcommittees, supported by the Office for Outer \nSpace Affairs, continue, as appropriate, to respond to such changes, in their role as \nunique platforms for international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space. \n14. We commit to strengthening international cooperation, for which the Committee \ncontinues to provide a unique platform in the exploration and peaceful uses of outer \nspace and the global governance of outer space activities, consistent with international \nlaw, taking into account the particular needs of developing countries. We also \nrecognize the common interest of all humankind in the progress of the exploration \nand use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and take note of General Assembly \nresolutions 51/122 of 13 December 1996 and 73/6 of 26 October 2018 and the \ncontribution that their implementation will make to the \u201cSpace2030\u201d Agenda.  \n15. We aim to promote equal opportunities in the space sector by encouraging, in \nparticular, young people and women to consider careers in science, technology, \nengineering and mathematics. \n16. We also aim to leverage to a greater extent new, innovative technologies, such \nas space technologies and their applications, to contribute to improved delivery of the \nmandates of the United Nations as a whole. \n17. We emphasize that the seven thematic priorities developed by the Committee in \nthe context of UNISPACE+50 constitute a comprehensive approach to addressing key \nareas and collectively serve to determine the core objectives of the future work of the \nCommittee and its subcommittees and the Office for Outer Space Affairs in the areas \nof global partnership in space exploration and innovation (thematic priority 1), current \n\nA/RES/76/3 \nThe \u201cSpace2030\u201d Agenda: space as a driver of \nsustainable development\n \n21-15518\n4/10 \n \nand future perspectives of the legal regime of outer space and global governance \n(thematic priority 2), enhanced information exchange on space objects and events \n(thematic priority 3), an international framework for space weather services (thematic \npriority 4), strengthened space cooperation for global health (thematic priority 5), \ninternational cooperation towards low-emission and resilient societies (thematic \npriority 6) and capacity-building for the twenty-first century (thematic priority 7).3 \n18. We also emphasize that, in fulfilling the \u201cSpace2030\u201d Agenda and \nimplementation plan, importance is attached to global partnerships and strengthened \ncooperation among Member States, United Nations entities, intergovernmental and \nnon-governmental organizations, industry and private sector entities, to ensure that, \nthrough joint efforts and by taking advantage of the practical experiences and \ncontributions of different stakeholders, the benefits of space will be brought to \neveryone, everywhere.  \n \n \nIII. \nObjectives  \n \n19. We, the States Members of the United Nations, commit to pursuing, based on \nthe above strategic vision, the following objectives. The actions described under each \noverarching objective could be taken by Member States to realize those objectives. \nThe four overarching objectives are structured around the four pillars of space \neconomy, space society, space accessibility and space diplomacy.
