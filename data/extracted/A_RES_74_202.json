Invites the international financial and banking institutions, in consultation \nwith national Governments, to develop tailored guidelines on how countries can \nattract long-term international investments, guided by the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development, in line with national plans and policies, and with a view to \nminimizing the adverse effects of capital market volatility; \n \n36.
