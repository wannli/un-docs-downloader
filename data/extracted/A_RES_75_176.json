and recognizing that effectively addressing \nthe challenges relating to the right to privacy in the context of modern communications \ntechnology requires an ongoing, concerted multi-stakeholder engagement,  \n \nNoting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all \nover the world to use new information and communications technologies, and at the \nsame time

to respect of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection \nof honour and reputation,17 while also noting the vast technological leaps that have \ntaken place since its adoption and the need to discuss the right to privacy in view of \nthe challenges of the digital age,  \n \nRecognizing the need to further discuss and analyse, based on international \nhuman rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to \nprivacy in the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and \nremedies, the impact of surveillance on the right to privacy and other human rights, \nas well as the need to examine the principles of non-arbitrariness, lawfulness, legality, \nnecessity and proportionality in relation to surveillance practices,  \n

\nframeworks in the design, evaluation and regulation of these practices,  \n \nRecognizing that, while the use of artificial intelligence can have significant \npositive economic and social impacts, it requires and allows for the processing of \nlarge amounts of data, often relating to personal data, including biometric data and \ndata on an individual\u2019s behaviour, social relationships, race or ethnicity, religion or \nbelief, which can pose serious risks to the enjoyment of the right to privacy, especially \nwhen done without proper safeguards, in particular when employed for identification, \ntracking, profiling, facial recognition, classification, behaviour prediction or scoring \nof individuals,  \n \nNoting that the use of artificial intelligence may, without proper safeguards, \npose the risk of reinforcing discrimination, including structural inequalities, and \nrecognizing that racially and otherwise discriminatory outcomes should be prevented \nin the design, development, implementation and use of emerging digital technologies,  \n \nEmphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of \ncommunications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, \nhacking and the unlawful use of biometric technologies, as highly intrusive acts, violate \nthe right to privacy, can interfere with the right to freedom of expression and to hold \nopinions without interference, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and \nassociation and the right to freedom of religion or belief and may contradict the tenets \nof a democratic society, including when undertaken extraterritorially or on a mass scale, \n \nRecognizing that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected \nonline, including the right to privacy,  \n \nNoting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be \nconsistent with international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the \nbasis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, \ncomprehensive and non-discriminatory, and that any interference with the right to \nprivacy must not be arbitrary or unlawful, bearing in mind what is reasonable with \nregard to the pursuance of legitimate aims, and recalling that States that are parties to \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must take the necessary steps \nto adopt laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights \nrecognized in the Covenant, \n \nExpressing concern about the spread of disinformation and misinformation, \nparticularly on social media platforms, which can be designed and implemented so as \nto mislead, to spread racism, xenophobia, negative stereotyping and stigmatization, \nto violate and abuse human rights, including the right to privacy, to impede freedom \nof expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, and to \nincite all forms of violence, hatred, intolerance, discrimination and hostility, and \nemphasizing the important contribution of journalists, civil society and academia in \ncountering this trend,  \n \nEmphasizing that States must respect international human rights obligations \nregarding the right to privacy when they intercept digital communications of \nindividuals and/or collect personal data, when they share or otherwise provide access \nto data collected through, inter alia, information- and intelligence-sharing agreements \nand when they require disclosure of personal data from third parties, including \nbusiness enterprises, \n \nNoting the increase in the collection of sensitive biometric information from \nindividuals, and stressing that States must comply with their human rights obligations \nand that

interception \nof communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of \ncommunications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried \nout on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights, \n \nEmphasizing that, in the digital age, technical solutions to secure and to protect \nthe confidentiality of digital communications, including measures for encryption, \npseudonymization and anonymity, are important to ensure the enjoyment of human \nrights, in particular the rights to privacy, to freedom of opinion and expression and to \nfreedom of peaceful assembly and association, and recognizing that States should \nrefrain from employing unlawful or arbitrary surveillance techniques, which may \ninclude forms of hacking,  \n \nNoting with deep concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations \nengaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, \njournalists and other media workers may frequently face threats and harassment and \nsuffer insecurity, as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their right to \nprivacy, as a result of their activities,  \n \nNoting that, while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and \nprotection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with \ntheir obligations under international human rights law,  \n \nNoting also, in that respect, that the prevention and suppression of terrorism is \na public interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that \nany measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations \nunder international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and \nhumanitarian law,  \n \nStressing the need to address prevailing challenges to bridge the digital divides, \nboth between and within countries, and the gender digital divide, and to harness \ninformation and communications technologies for development, and recalling the need \nto emphasize quality of access to bridge digital and knowledge divides, using a \nmultidimensional approach that includes speed, stability, affordability, language, \ntraining, capacity-building, local content and accessibility for persons with disabilities, \nand to promote the full enjoyment of human rights, including the right to privacy,  \n \nStressing also the need to ensure that national security and public health \nmeasures, including the use of technology to monitor and contain the spread of \ninfectious diseases, are in full compliance with the obligations of States under \ninternational human rights law and adhere to the principles of lawfulness, legality, \nlegitimacy with regard to the aim pursued, necessity and proportionality and the need \nto protect human rights, including the right to privacy, and personal data in the \nresponse to health or other emergencies,  \n \nNoting the importance of protecting and respecting the right of individuals to \nprivacy when designing, developing or deploying technological means in response to \ndisasters, epidemics and pandemics, especially the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic, including digital exposure notification and contact tracing,  \n \n1. \nReaffirms the right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected \nto arbitrary or unlawful
