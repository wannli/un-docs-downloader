negative impact on health and \nnutrition, especially in Africa, parts of Asia, in particular West Asia, in the Pacific and \nin parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, and in this regard underlining the urgent \nneed for joint efforts at all levels to respond to the situation in a coherent and effective \nmanner,  \n \nRecognizing that the coronavirus disease (COVID\u201119) pandemic, its impacts and \nthe extraordinary measures adopted to combat it have delivered one of the most \ndevastating blows to global food security and nutrition in recent times, with a \ndisproportionate impact on women and children, and deeply concerned about the \nassessment that world hunger rose further in 2021, reflecting exacerbated inequalities \nacross and within countries,  \n \nRemaining concerned that the adverse effects of climate change, including more \nfrequent and extreme weather events, will disproportionately impact people in \nvulnerable situations, especially women and

among the key factors contributing to a \nreversal in the long-term progress in fighting global hunger, making the prospect of \nending hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 more difficult,  \n \nReiterating that the root causes of food insecurity and malnutrition are poverty, \ngrowing inequality, inequity and lack of access to resources and income-earning \nopportunities, the COVID\u201119 pandemic, the effects of climate change, biodiversity \nloss, water scarcity and disasters, conflicts and geopolitical tensions,  \n \nRecalling its resolution 72/239 of 20 December 2017, in which it
