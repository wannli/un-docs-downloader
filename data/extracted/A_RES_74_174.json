and social advantages to countries, communities \nand children, fuelling economic development and encouraging interconnectedness \nthrough the sharing of ideas and experiences, but that such advances

with children, and noting that this conduct \nviolates and threatens the integrity, rights and safety of children,  \n \nNoting that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized \nCrime3 is a tool that may be used by States parties to provide international cooperation \nfor preventing and combating transnational organized crime and that, in some States \nparties, may be used

context, \n \nReaffirming the importance of existing international legal instruments that \ncontribute to the fight against child sexual exploitation and sexual abuse and contain \ninternationally agreed upon definitions, and recognizing the importance of using \nterminology that reflects the severity of the harm inflicted on children by such \nconduct, \n \nAcknowledging the importance of existing legal instruments that require parties \nto criminalize the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and that enable effective \ninternational cooperation in the context of combating child sexual exploitation and \nabuse, \n \nRecalling its resolutions 73/154 of 17 December 2018 on protecting children \nfrom bullying, 73/148 of 17 December 2018, entitled \u201cIntensification of efforts

prevention and \ncriminal justice responses to combat sexual exploitation of children, 6 \n \nAcknowledging the distinct and important roles that parents, legal guardians, \nschools, civil society,

inter alia, the WeProtect Global Alliance and Global Kids \nOnline, \n \nRecalling Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice resolution \n27/3 of 18 May 2018,7 in which the Commission expressed concern that the criminal \nmisuse of information and communications technologies made it possible for \ncriminals to commit illegal activities such as the recruitment, control and
