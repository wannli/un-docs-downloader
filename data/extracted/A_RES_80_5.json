In turn, social development and social justice cannot be attained \nin the absence of peace and security or in the absence of respect for all human rights \nand fundamental freedoms. \n5. \nWe meet 30 years after the first World Summit for Social Development and days \nafter the commemoration of the eightieth anniversary of the United Nations, with a \ndetermination to promote social development and social justice anchored in a \nstrengthened and effective multilateral system, and we reaffirm and remain guided by \nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.  \n6. \nWe recommit to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, as they \nremain relevant and valid, and the further initiatives for social development adopted \nby the General Assembly, including at its twenty-fourth special session,3 and to a \ncontinued global dialogue on social development issues.  \n7. \nWe reaffirm the full, timely and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda \nand the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals, upholding all the principles \nenshrined in it, including the promise to leave no one behind and reach the furthest \nbehind first, and to place people at the centre of development, with due consideration \nof the needs of present and future generations, and a strong commitment to \nsafeguarding our planet. \n8. \nWe also reaffirm the intergovernmental commitments related to social \ndevelopment, including those in the political declarations of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals Summits held in 2019 and 2023, 4  as well as the relevant \ncommitments in the Pact for the Future and its annexes.5 \n9. \nWe reaffirm the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International \nConference on Financing for Development6 as an integral part of the 2030 Agenda. \nWe are committed to its full implementation, which is critical for the realization of \nthe Sustainable Development Goals and their targets. \n10. We welcome the outcome document of the Fourth International Conference on \nFinancing for Development, the Sevilla Commitment, 7  which renews the global \nfinancing for development framework, building on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, \nand call for its timely and effective implementation. \n11. \nWe reaffirm that the pursuit and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms for all, encompassing civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, \nwhich includes the right to development, must be respected, protected and promoted, \nwithout distinction or discrimination of any kind.  \n__________________ \n \n3 Resolution S-24/2, annex. \n \n4 Resolution 74/4, annex, and resolution 78/1, annex. \n \n5 Resolution 79/1. \n \n6 Resolution 69/313, annex. \n \n7 Resolution 79/323, annex. \n\nDoha Political Declaration of the \u201cWorld Social Summit\u201d under the \ntitle \u201cthe Second World Summit for Social Development\u201d \nA/RES/80/5\n \n3/18\n25-17700 \n \n12. We reaffirm that the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, \nincluding extreme poverty, remains the greatest global challenge and an indispensable \nrequirement for sustainable development.  \n13. We stress the need to take urgent and ambitious climate action in the \nimplementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 8 \nand the Paris Agreement 9  in relation to climate mitigation, adaptation and the \nprovision of the means of implementation, especially finance to developing countries. \n14. We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and \nDevelopment, 10  including, inter alia, the principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities, as set out in principle 7 thereof. \n15. We gather here in Doha at a summit of renewed hope, driven by commitment \nand collective action. While facing urgent and complex challenges, we see new \nopportunities. We are convinced that meaningful progress is possible through genuine \nsolidarity, effective multilateralism and inclusive international cooperation, taking \ninto account national realities and regional contexts, particularly in developing \ncountries. \n16. We remain committed to a political, economic, ethical and spiritual vision for \nsocial development that is based on human dignity, human rights, equality, respect, \npeace, democracy, mutual responsibility and cooperation, and full respect for the \nvarious religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people. \n17. We welcome the progress made towards the full implementation of the \nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action through concerted action at the \nnational, regional and global levels. The global wealth of nations has grown \nsignificantly since 1995 and international trade has grown even more. Global labour \nproductivity has increased, and the global unemployment rate has reached a historic \nlow. Extreme poverty has been reduced and access to education, healthcare and social \nprotection has improved considerably. \n18. Yet, 30 years after the convening of the World Summit for Social Development, \nprogress remains slow and uneven, and major gaps and inequalities persist within and \namong countries. With only five years remaining until the 2030 deadline, progress \ntowards achieving most of the Sustainable Development Goals has been far too slow, \nwith some goals stalled or even regressing despite notable advances in a few areas:  \n \n(a) \nAlthough great strides have been made in reducing poverty since 1995, in \nrecent years progress has slowed, and millions of people still live in extreme poverty \nand over 1 billion people endure poverty in different forms and dimensions. Children, \nwomen, persons with disabilities, people living in rural areas and those in vulnerable \nsituations experience higher poverty rates than the rest of the population. Hunger, \nfood insecurity and malnutrition are still a reality, with global undernourishment \nrising in recent years. While access to education has expanded, still too many children \nare out of school; \n \n(b) \nIn addition, while millions have been lifted out of poverty, billions of \npeople live close to the poverty line and face a constant risk of falling into extreme \npoverty.

I, Resolutions Adopted by the Conference (United Nations publication, \nSales No. E.93.I.8 and corrigendum), resolution 1, annex I. \n\nA/RES/80/5 \nDoha Political Declaration of the \u201cWorld Social Summit\u201d under the \ntitle \u201cthe Second World Summit for Social Development\u201d\n \n25-17700\n4/18 \n \ncoverage, including social protection floors, almost 4 billion people still lack access \nto any form of social protection, including nearly 2 billion children;  \n \n(c) \nMillions of workers continue to live in poverty, earning wages and \nincomes that are not sufficient for an adequate standard of living or to sustain their \nfamilies. Informal employment remains pervasive, with billions of people making \ntheir living in the informal economy. Women and young people are disproportionately \nengaged in informal and precarious employment. Furthermore, progress towards \nending child labour is too slow;  \n \n(d) \nMillions of youth do not have access to education, employment or training, \nthe majority of whom are young women. In the labour market, young people, \nespecially youth with disabilities, experience higher levels of unemployment, \ninformal employment and working poverty. These decent work deficits can have long-\nlasting consequences on poverty eradication efforts and affect the well-being of \ncurrent and future generations; \n \n(e) \nToday, inequality has reached staggering levels. Since 1995, income \ninequality has increased in many countries, developed and developing. Global wage \ngaps remain significant. Gender inequality is deeply entrenched. On average, women \nearn less than men and millions of women worldwide are outside the labour force; \n \n(f) \nPersons with disabilities continue to be more likely to live in poverty, are \nunderemployed and unemployed, and face additional disability-related costs, \nincluding medical costs, as well as other significant and persistent social and \neconomic barriers to inclusion in society;  \n \n(g) \nDigital divides within and among countries persist, particularly in rural \nand remote areas. Billions of people currently do not have connectivity, access to the \nInternet and lack digital skills. Digital infrastructure, connectivity and access to the \nInternet in developing countries, particularly least developed countries, landlocked \ndeveloping countries and small island developing States, remain challenging;  \n \n(h) \nMultiple, persistent and new challenges are reversing social development \ngains, including geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, economic crises, inequalities \nwithin and among countries, climate change, natural hazards and disasters, \nbiodiversity loss, environmental degradation, water scarcity, desertification, \npollution, conflict-induced famine and starvation, humanitarian emergencies and \nforced displacement of people, refugee crisis, pandemics and other health \nemergencies, gender inequality, racial discrimination, uneven technological \nadvancements, unsustainable debt burdens and unequal access to technology and \ncapital; \n \n(i) \nComplex and interrelated opportunities, challenges and risks related to \ndemographic shifts remain, including rapid population growth, declining birth rates \nand population ageing. Between 2024 and 2030, the number of persons aged 60 years \nor over is globally projected to outnumber youth, and this increase will be the greatest \nand the most rapid in the developing world. \n19. While these problems are global in character and affect all countries, we clearly \nacknowledge that each country faces specific challenges in its pursuit of sustainable \ndevelopment. We recognize the special challenges facing all developing countries, in \nparticular, African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing \ncountries and small island developing States, as well as the specific challenges facing \nmiddle-income countries and countries in conflict and post-conflict situations.  \n20. We commit to support and implement the relevant development agendas, \nstrategies and programmes of action for countries in special situations, including the \n\nDoha Political Declaration of the \u201cWorld Social Summit\u201d under the \ntitle \u201cthe Second World Summit for Social Development\u201d \nA/RES/80/5\n \n5/18\n25-17700 \n \nDoha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries, 11  the Awaza \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024\u2013\n203412 and the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States, 13 \nand reaffirm our support for the achievement of the African Union Agenda 2063. We \nlook forward to the elaboration of a specific inter-agency, comprehensive, system-\nwide response plan for middle-income countries by the United Nations development \nsystem.  \n21. We are convinced that addressing today\u2019s challenges to social development \nrequires strengthening international solidarity, upholding human rights, building \ntrust, and a renewed commitment to multilateral action on the attainment of social \ndevelopment and the implementation of the sustainable development agenda in its \nsocial, economic and environmental dimensions. We will advance innovative \nsolutions and inclusive international cooperation to fully translate the commitments \nof the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action and the social dimension \nof the 2030 Agenda into concrete actions to achieve social development for all, in \nparticular to the benefit of developing countries. \n22. We reaffirm that the Commission for Social Development has the primary \nresponsibility for the follow-up to the Summit and review of the implementation of \nthe Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action.  \n23. We recognize that the multilateral system and its institutions, with the United \nNations and its Charter at the centre, must be strengthened to keep pace with a \nchanging world and address global challenges in the sphere of social development. \nThey must be fit for the present and the future \u2013 effective and capable, just, \ndemocratic, equitable and representative of today\u2019s world, inclusive, interconnected \nand financially stable.  \n24. We will explore bold and effective social policies that are woven into a whole-\nof-government, whole-of-society, people-centred and integrated approaches aimed at \nachieving social development for all, including through enhancing social policy \ncoherence, building effective, accountable, transparent and inclusive institutions at \nall levels, achieving social justice for all, upholding democracy, the rule of law, good \ngovernance and access to justice, combating all forms of corruption and reinforcing \nnational coordination, as well as multi-stakeholder engagement and integrated \nresponses to social development challenges, and avoiding policy silos across sectors.  \n25. We recognize the contributions of multi-stakeholder engagement to social \ndevelopment. We will continue to collaborate meaningfully with all relevant \nstakeholders, including civil society, social partners and the private sector, and \nencourage multi-stakeholder collaboration and partnerships. \n26. On the basis of our common pursuit of social development, which is aimed at \nsocial justice, solidarity, harmony and equality, within and among countries, guided \nby the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international \nlaw, as well as policy objectives, development priorities and religious and cultural \ndiversity, and full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms, we reaffirm \nour global drive for social progress and development. \n27. We strive for a future that is inclusive, resilient, sustainable and just. We \nenvisage a world free of poverty, hunger, unemployment, preventable diseases, \nracism, discrimination and insecurity and a world of equality, equity, shared \n__________________ \n \n11 Resolution 76/258, annex. \n \n12 Resolution 79/233, annex; see also resolution 79/279. \n \n13 Resolution 78/317, annex. \n\nA/RES/80/5 \nDoha Political Declaration of the \u201cWorld Social Summit\u201d under the \ntitle \u201cthe Second World Summit for Social Development\u201d\n \n25-17700\n6/18 \n \nprosperity and peace, where the dignity of all people is respected, and where no one \nis left behind. \n \n \n \nA call to action \n \n28. We recommit ourselves to creating an enabling economic, political, social, \ncultural and legal environment to achieve social development for all.  \n29. We will adopt a holistic approach towards the eradication of poverty in all its \nforms and dimensions, including through addressing the challenges of extreme \npoverty and multidimensional poverty, address their disproportionate impact on \ncountries in special situations and people in vulnerable situations and combat the \nfeminization of poverty while ensuring that the focus is on building resilience to \nshocks and challenges, accelerating actions to eradicate poverty and avoiding \nrelapsing back into it. In this regard we commit to:  \n \n(a) \nTaking effective measures, including policies and programmes, to address \nthe root causes of poverty and underlying causes of inequality, providing for the basic \nneeds of all and increasing resilience for interconnected crises. These efforts should \ninclude the elimination of hunger and malnutrition; the provision of social protection, \nfood security, education, livelihoods, employment, decent work for all, clean water \nand sanitation, adequate shelter and reliable health systems; and participation in social \nand cultural life, with special priority given to the needs and rights of women and \nchildren and persons in vulnerable situations, who often bear the greatest burden of \npoverty; \n \n(b) \nReinforcing international development cooperation for developing \ncountries\u2019 capacities to achieve poverty eradication, as well as the necessary measures \nto close financing gaps for poverty eradication and invest in capacity-building, \ntechnical assistance and programmes; \n \n(c) \nExploring opportunities to mobilize additional finance, both public and \nprivate, through official development assistance-funded activities that are responsive \nto country needs and focused on long-term development and poverty eradication, \nwhile ensuring that additional private finance mobilized is not a substitute for existing \ncommitments; \n \n(d) \nEnsuring sustainable and equitable financing for social protection systems \nas one of the enablers for eradicating poverty, reducing inequality and fostering social \ninclusion, as well as investing in programmes for eradicating poverty, including the \nfeminization of poverty, to address underlying causes of inequality by promoting a \nsustainable economy for the well-being of all;

The global wealth of nations has grown significantly since 1995 and international trade has grown even more. Global labour productivity has increased, and the global unemployment rate has reached a historic low. Extreme poverty has been reduced and access to education, healthcare and social protection has improved considerably.",
    "18": "Yet, 30 years after the convening of the World Summit for Social Development, progress remains slow and uneven, and major gaps and inequalities persist within and among countries. With only five years remaining until the 2030 deadline, progress towards achieving most of the Sustainable Development Goals has been far too slow, with some goals stalled or even regressing despite notable advances in a few areas: (a) Although great strides have been made in reducing poverty since 1995, in recent years progress has slowed, and millions of people still live in extreme poverty and over 1 billion people endure poverty in different forms and dimensions. Children, women, persons with disabilities, people living in rural areas and those in vulnerable situations experience higher poverty rates than the rest of the population. Hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition are still a reality, with global undernourishment rising in recent years. While access to education has expanded, still too many children are out of school; (b) In addition, while millions have been lifted out of poverty, billions of people live close to the poverty line and face a constant risk of falling into extreme poverty. Despite significant global progress in gradually expanding social protection coverage, including social protection floors, almost 4 billion people still lack access to any form of social protection, including nearly 2 billion children; (c) Millions of workers continue to live in poverty, earning wages and incomes that are not sufficient for an adequate standard of living or to sustain their families. Informal employment remains pervasive, with billions of people making their living in the informal economy. Women and young people are disproportionately engaged in informal and precarious employment. Furthermore, progress towards ending child labour is too slow; (d) Millions of youth do not have access to education, employment or training, the majority of whom are young women. In the labour market, young people, especially youth with disabilities, experience higher levels of unemployment, informal employment and working poverty. These decent work deficits can have long- lasting consequences on poverty eradication efforts and affect the well-being of current and future generations; (e) Today, inequality has reached staggering levels. Since 1995, income inequality has increased in many countries, developed and developing. Global wage gaps remain significant. Gender inequality is deeply entrenched. On average, women earn less than men and millions of women worldwide are outside the labour force; (f) Persons with disabilities continue to be more likely to live in poverty, are underemployed and unemployed, and face additional disability-related costs, including medical costs, as well as other significant and persistent social and economic barriers to inclusion in society; (g) Digital divides within and among countries persist, particularly in rural and remote areas. Billions of people currently do not have connectivity, access to the Internet and lack digital skills. Digital infrastructure, connectivity and access to the Internet in developing countries, particularly least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, remain challenging; (h) Multiple, persistent and new challenges are reversing social development gains, including geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, economic crises, inequalities within and among countries, climate change, natural hazards and disasters, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, water scarcity, desertification, pollution, conflict-induced famine and starvation, humanitarian emergencies and forced displacement of people, refugee crisis, pandemics and other health emergencies, gender inequality, racial discrimination, uneven technological advancements, unsustainable debt burdens and unequal access to technology and capital; (i) Complex and interrelated opportunities, challenges and risks related to demographic shifts remain, including rapid population growth, declining birth rates and population ageing. Between 2024 and 2030, the number of persons aged 60 years or over is globally projected to outnumber youth, and this increase will be the greatest and the most rapid in the developing world.",
