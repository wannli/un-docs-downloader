refraining from undue restrictions, \nsuch as Internet shutdowns, arbitrary or unlawful surveillance or online censorship, \n \nRecognizing that a lack of access to affordable, safe, inclusive, quality, \naccessible, reliable and trustworthy technologies and services remains a critical \nchallenge in many developing countries, and that such access to technologies is a first \nstep in promoting digital literacy, \n \nStressing the need to close digital divides, which may reflect and amplify \nexisting social, cultural and economic inequalities, both between and within countries, \nincluding the rural-urban, youth-older persons, gender, racial and ethnic digital \ndivides, and to harness digital technologies for sustainable development and the \npromotion and protection of

\ntarget content towards online users may undermine user agency and access to \ninformation online, and noting further that the collection, processing, use, storage and \nsharing of personal data, including for reuse, sale or multiple resale, risks infringing \non the user\u2019s human rights, \n \nNoting further that the use of artificial intelligence can contribute to the \npromotion and protection of human rights, can play a significant role as an enabler of \nsustainable development and has the potential to transform Governments and \nsocieties, economic sectors and the world of work, and in this regard welcoming the \nestablishment of the Independent International Scientific Panel on Artificial \nIntelligence and the Global Dialogue on Artificial Intelligence Governance, \n \nNoting with concern that artificial intelligence or machine-learning \ntechnologies, without human rights safeguards, as well as proper technical, \nregulatory, legal and ethical safeguards, and without adequate and effective \nevaluation and feedback mechanisms, may pose the risk of reinforcing systemic, \nracial and gender-based discrimination and can lead to decisions that have the \npotential to affect the enjoyment of human rights, including economic, social and \ncultural rights, and affect non-discrimination, and recognizing the need to prevent \nracial and otherwise discriminatory outcomes and apply international human rights \nlaw and data-protection frameworks in all stages of the life cycle of these technologies \nand practices, \n \nRecognizing that persons in vulnerable situations, including children, may be \nparticularly exposed to online risks and violence, including cyberbullying, \ncyberstalking, child exploitation and abuse and other forms of

\nstrategies, services and forums relating to it, is accessible, inclusive and safe, \n \nExpressing concern about the spread of misinformation and disinformation, \nparticularly on social media platforms, including content generated or manipulated \nthrough artificial intelligence, which can be designed and implemented so as to \nmislead, to spread racism, xenophobia, negative stereotyping and stigmatization, to \nviolate and abuse human rights, including the right to privacy, to impede freedom of \nexpression, including the freedom to seek, access and impart information, as set out \n\nA/C.3/80/L.46 \n \n25-17788\n6/10 \n \nin the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and to incite all forms of \nviolence, hatred, intolerance, discrimination and hostility, \n
