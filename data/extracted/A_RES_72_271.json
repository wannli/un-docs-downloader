Secretary-General transmitting the report on \nimproving global road safety1 and the recommendations contained therein,  \n \nReaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled \u201cTransforming \nour world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d, in which it adopted a \ncomprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative \nSustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for \nthe full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating \npoverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest \nglobal challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its \ncommitment to achieving sustainable development in its

road safety\n \n18-05866\n2/9 \n \npersons, as well as road safety targets aimed at strengthening resilience and adaptive \ncapacity vis-\u00e0-vis hazards and developing sustainable and resilient infrastructure,  \n \nNoting that, as the end of the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011\u20132020 \napproaches, the overwhelming majority of road traffic deaths and injuries are \npreventable and that, despite some improvements in many countries, including in \ndeveloping countries, they remain a major public health and development problem \nthat has broad social and economic consequences which, if unaddressed, may affect \nprogress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,  \n \nRecognizing that human suffering, combined with costs to some countries of up \nto 5 per cent of their gross domestic product a year, makes reducing road traffic deaths \nand injuries both an economic and a social priority, especially for some countries, and \nthat investment in road safety has a positive impact on public health and the economy, \n \nTaking into account that road traffic deaths and injuries are also a social equity \nissue, as the poor and the vulnerable are most frequently also vulnerable road users, \nnamely, pedestrians, cyclists, users of motorized two- and three-wheeled vehicles and \npassengers of unsafe public transport, who are disproportionately affected and \nexposed to risks and road traffic crashes, which can lead to a cycle of poverty \nexacerbated by income loss, and recalling that the aim of road safety policies should \nbe to guarantee protection to all users,  \n \nRecognizing that road safety requires addressing broader issues of equitable \naccess to mobility and that the promotion of sustainable modes of transport, in \nparticular safe public transport and safe walking and cycling, is a key element of road \nsafety,  \n \nTaking into account the importance of strengthening institutional capacity and \ncontinuing international cooperation, including South-South and triangular \ncooperation, cooperation between countries that share roads across borders and \ncooperation among regional and international organizations, to further support efforts \nto improve road safety, particularly in developing countries, and providing, as \nappropriate, support to meet the goals of the Decade of Action and those of the 2030 \nAgenda,  \n \nEmphasizing that, while each country has primary responsibility for its own \neconomic and social development and the role of national policies and development \nstrategies cannot be overemphasized in the context of reaching the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, international public finance plays an important role in \ncomplementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically, \nespecially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited domestic \nresources,  \n \nExpressing its concern that the number of road traffic crashes remains \nunacceptably high, and that crashes represent a leading cause of death and injury \naround the world, killing more than 1.3 million people and injuring as many as \n50 million people a year, with 90 per cent of those casualties occurring in developing \ncountries, and concerned also that road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death \naround the world for children and young people between 15 and 29 years of age,  \n \nExpressing its concern also that, at the current rate of progress, target 3.6 of \nSustainable Development Goal 3 will not be met,  \n \nExpressing its concern further that the adoption and implementation of road \nsafety measures remain inadequate in many countries,  \n \nAcknowledging the leading role of Oman and the Russian Federation in drawing \nthe attention

substances, mobile phones and other electronic and \ntexting devices,  \n \nEncouraging Member States to promote multi-stakeholder partnerships to \naddress the safety of vulnerable road users, the delivery of first aid to victims of road \ntraffic accidents or crashes, training and education, notably in developing and least \ndeveloped countries,  \n \nRecognizing the progress made by some Member States in providing road traffic \ncrash victims and their families with universal access to health care in the \npre-hospital, hospital, post-hospital and rehabilitation and reintegration phases,  \n \nAcknowledging the work of the United Nations system, in particular the \nleadership of the World Health Organization, in close cooperation with the United \nNations regional commissions, in establishing, implementing and monitoring various \naspects of the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011\u20132020, and \nthe commitment of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), \nthe United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and \nthe International Labour Organization, among other entities, to supporting those efforts \nas well as that of the World Bank and regional development banks to implementing \nroad safety projects and programmes, in particular in developing countries,  \n \nCommending the World

commissions for their work in \nincreasing road safety activities and advocating increased political commitment to \nroad safety, and in working towards setting regional and national road traffic casualty \nreduction targets, in particular the work of the Economic Commission for Europe in \nelaborating global road safety-related legal instruments, including international \nconventions and agreements, technical standards, resolutions and good practice \nrecommendations, as well as in servicing 58 global and regional legal instruments \nthat provide a commonly accepted legal and technical framework for the development \nof international road, rail, inland water and combined transport,  \n \nEmphasizing the role of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration as a \nconsultative mechanism to facilitate international road safety cooperation,  \n \nCommending the work of two Economic Commission for Europe groups of \nexperts, namely, on road signs and signals and
