independent and comprehensive \nassessment of the social, environmental and cultural impact of globalization on \nsocieties,  \n \nRecognizing in each culture a dignity and value that deserve recognition, respect \nand preservation, convinced that, in their rich variety and diversity and in the \nreciprocal influences that they exert on one another, all cultures form part of the \ncommon heritage belonging to all humankind, and aware of the risk that globalization \nposes more of a threat to cultural diversity if the developing world remains poor and \nmarginalized,  \n \nRecognizing also that multilateral mechanisms have a unique role to play in \nmeeting the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization,  \n \nRealizing the need to consider the challenges and opportunities linked to \nglobalization with a view to addressing such challenges and building on possible \nopportunities in order to achieve the full enjoyment of all human rights,  \n \nEmphasizing the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance \nof international, regional and bilateral cooperation and the need to protect the human \nrights of migrants, particularly at a time when migration flows have increased in the \nglobalized economy,  \n \nExpressing grave concern at the negative impact of international financial \nturmoil on social and economic development and on the full enjoyment of all human \nrights, particularly in the light of the continuing global financial and economic crisis, \nwhich may have an adverse impact on the ability of Member States to implement the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and recognizing that developing \ncountries are in a more vulnerable situation when facing such impact and that regional \neconomic cooperation and development strategies and programmes can play a role in \nmitigating such impact,  \n \nExpressing deep concern at the negative impact of the continuing global food \nand energy crises and climate change challenges on social and economic development \nand on the full enjoyment of all human rights for all,  \n \nRecognizing that globalization should be guided by the fundamental principles \nthat underpin the corpus of human rights, such as equity, participation, accountability, \nnon-discrimination, transparency, inclusivity and equality at both the national and the \ninternational levels, respect for diversity, tolerance and international cooperation and \nsolidarity,  \n \nEmphasizing that the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full \nrealization and effective enjoyment of human rights and that its immediate alleviation \nand eventual elimination must remain a high priority for the international community,  \n \nAcknowledging that there is greater acceptance that the increasing debt burden \nfaced by the most indebted developing countries is unsustainable and constitutes one \nof the principal obstacles to achieving sustainable development and poverty \neradication and that, for many developing countries, excessive debt servicing has \nseverely constrained their capacity to promote social development and to provide \nbasic services to realize economic, social and cultural rights,  \n \nStrongly reiterating the determination to ensure the timely and full realization \nof the sustainable development goals and objectives agreed at the major United \nNations conferences and summits, including those agreed at the United Nations \nsummit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, which aim to \ngalvanize efforts towards poverty eradication,  \n\nA/RES/72/185 \nGlobalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights\n \n17-23177 \n4/5 \n \n \nGravely concerned at the inadequacy of measures to narrow the widening gap \nbetween the developed and the developing countries, and within countries, which has \ncontributed to, inter alia, deepening poverty and has adversely affected the full \nenjoyment of all human rights, in particular in developing countries,  \n \nEmphasizing that transnational corporations and other business enterprises have \na responsibility to respect all human rights,  \n \nEmphasizing also that human beings strive for a world that is respectful of \nhuman rights and cultural diversity and that in this regard they work to ensure that all \nactivities, including those affected by globalization, are consistent with those aims,  \n \n1. \nWelcomes the adoption by the Heads of State and Government and High \nRepresentatives, meeting at United Nations Headquarters in New York from 25 to \n27 September 2015, of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;15  \n \n2. \nRecognizes that, while globalization, through its impact on, inter alia, the \nrole of the State, may affect human rights, the promotion and protection of all human \nrights is first and foremost the responsibility of the State;  \n \n3. \nEmphasizes that development should be at the centre of the international \neconomic agenda and that coherence between national development strategies and \ninternational obligations and commitments is imperative for an enabling environment \nfor development and an inclusive and equitable globalization;  \n \n4. \nReaffirms that narrowing the gap between rich and poor, both within and \nbetween countries, is an explicit goal at the national and international levels, as part \nof the effort to create an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of all human \nrights;  \n \n5. \nAlso reaffirms the commitment to create an environment at both the \nnational and the global levels that is conducive to development and to the eradication \nof poverty by, inter alia, promoting good governance within each country and at the \ninternational level, eliminating protectionism, enhancing transparency in the \nfinancial, monetary and trading systems and committing to an open, equitable, rules-\nbased, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system;  \n \n6. \nRecognizes the impact that the global financial and economic crisis is still \nhaving on the ability of countries, particularly developing countries, to mobilize \nresources for development and to address the impact of this crisis, and in this context \ncalls upon all States and the international community to alleviate, in an inclusive and \ndevelopment-oriented manner, any negative impacts of this crisis on the realization \nand the effective enjoyment of all human rights;  \n \n7. \nAlso recognizes that, while globalization offers great opportunities, the \nfact that its benefits are very unevenly shared and its costs unevenly distributed \nrepresents an aspect of the process that affects the full enjoyment of all human rights, \nin particular in developing countries;  \n \n8. \nWelcomes the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \nRights on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of human rights, 16 which \nfocuses on the liberalization of agricultural trade and its impact on the realization of \nthe right to development, including the right to food, and takes note of the conclusions \nand recommendations contained therein;  \n \n9. \nReaffirms the international commitment to eliminating hunger and to \nsecuring food

programmes designed to address \nhunger and malnutrition, when appropriate, through the use of local or regional \npurchase;  \n \n10.

Also recognizes that only through broad and sustained efforts, including \npolicies and measures at the global level to create a shared future based upon our \ncommon humanity in all its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and \nequitable and have a human face, thus contributing to the full enjoyment of all human \nrights;  \n \n13. Underlines the urgent need to establish an equitable, transparent and \ndemocratic international system to strengthen and broaden the participation of \ndeveloping countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting;  \n \n14. Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural \ntransformation, with numerous interdisciplinary aspects, which has an impact on the \nenjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right \nto development;  \n \n15. Also affirms that the international community should strive to respond to \nthe challenges and opportunities posed by globalization in a manner that promotes \nand protects human rights while ensuring respect for the cultural diversity of all;  \n \n16. Underlines, therefore, the need to continue to analyse the consequences of \nglobalization for the full enjoyment of all human rights;  \n \n17. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General,17 and requests him to \ncontinue to seek further the views of Member States and relevant agencies of the \nUnited Nations system and to submit to the General Assembly at its seventy-third \nsession a substantive report on the subject based on those views, including \nrecommendations on ways to address the impact of globalization on the full \nenjoyment of all human rights. \n \n73rd plenary meeting  \n19 December 2017 \n \n__________________ \n \n17  A/72/132.  \n",
