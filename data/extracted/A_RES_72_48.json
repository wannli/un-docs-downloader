Promotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament \nand non-proliferation \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nDetermined to foster strict respect for the purposes and principles enshrined in \nthe Charter of the United Nations, \n \nRecalling its resolution 56/24 T of 29 November 2001 on multilateral \ncooperation in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation and global efforts \nagainst terrorism and other relevant resolutions, as well as its resolutions 57/63 of \n22 November 2002, 58/44 of 8 December 2003, 59/69 of 3 December 2004, 60/59 of \n8 December 2005, 61/62 of 6

\nsettlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the \npeace, as enshrined in the Charter, \n \nRecalling further the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 in which it is \nstated, inter alia, that the responsibility for managing worldwide economic and \nsocial development, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be \nshared among the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally and \n__________________ \n \n1  Resolution 55/2. \n\nA/RES/72/48 \nPromotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament and non proliferation\n \n17-21726 \n2/3 \n \nthat, as the most universal and most representative organization in the world, the \nUnited Nations must play the central role, \n \nConvinced that, in the globalization era and with the information revolution, \narms regulation, non-proliferation and disarmament problems are more than ever the \nconcern of all countries in the world, which are affected in one way or another by \nthese problems and therefore should have the possibility to participate in the \nnegotiations that arise to tackle them, \n \nBearing in mind the existence of a broad structure of disarmament and arms \nregulation \nagreements \nresulting \nfrom \nnon-discriminatory \nand \ntransparent \nmultilateral negotiations with the participation of a large number of countries, \nregardless of their size and power, \n \nAware of the need to advance further in the field of arms regulation, \nnon-proliferation and disarmament on the basis of universal, multilateral, \nnon-discriminatory and transparent negotiations with the goal of reaching general \nand complete disarmament under strict international control, \n \nRecognizing the complementarity of bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral \nnegotiations on disarmament, \n \nRecognizing also that the proliferation and development of weapons of mass \ndestruction, including nuclear weapons, are among the most immediate threats to \ninternational peace and security which need to be dealt with, with the highest \npriority, \n \nConsidering that the multilateral disarmament agreements provide the \nmechanism for States parties to consult one another and to cooperate in solving any \nproblems which may arise in relation to the objective of, or in the application of, the \nprovisions of the agreements and that such consultations and cooperation may also \nbe undertaken through appropriate international procedures within the framework of \nthe United Nations and in accordance with the Charter, \n \nStressing that international cooperation, the peaceful settlement of disputes, \ndialogue and confidence-building measures would make an essential contribution to \nthe creation of multilateral and bilateral friendly relations among peoples and \nnations, \n \nBeing concerned at the continuous erosion of multilateralism in the field of \narms regulation, non-proliferation and disarmament, and recognizing that a resort to \nunilateral actions by Member States in resolving their security concerns would \njeopardize international peace and security and undermine confidence in the \ninternational security system as well as the foundations of the United Nations itself, \n \nNoting that the Seventeenth Conference of Heads of State or Government of \nNon-Aligned Countries, held on Margarita Island, Bolivarian Republic of \nVenezuela, from 13 to 18 September 2016, welcomed the adoption of resolution \n70/31 on the promotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament and \nnon-proliferation and underlined the fact that multilateralism and multilaterally \nagreed solutions, in accordance with the Charter, provide the only sustainable \nmethod of addressing disarmament and international security issues, \n \nReaffirming the absolute validity of multilateral diplomacy in the field of \ndisarmament and non-proliferation, and determined to promote multilateralism as an \nessential way to develop arms regulation and disarmament negotiations, \n \n1. \nReaffirms multilateralism as the core principle in negotiations in the area \nof disarmament
