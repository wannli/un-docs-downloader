I, resolution 1, \nannex. \n \n5  Resolution 63/239, annex. \n\nTowards a New International Economic Order \nA/RES/73/240\n \n3/5\n18-22618 \n \nnumber of undernourished people has been on the rise since 2014, reaching an \nestimated 815 million in 2016, \n \nConcerned further about recent economic developments in the context of the \ncontinued challenges to achieving sustained economic growth, in which persistently \nhigh levels of inequality pose a challenge to robust growth and sustainable \ndevelopment, declining private investment in infrastructure highlights the obstacles \nto bridging the infrastructure financing gap and advancing the long-term financing of \nsustainable development, emerging debt challenges and vulnerabilities have \nintensified across developing countries, global exchange rate volatility has intensified \nand global inflationary trends have diverged, and that the weak prospects for the \nglobal economy put at risk vital public investment in education, health and action on \nclimate change, as well as progress in poverty eradication, especially in developing \ncountries,  \n \nConcerned that billions of the world\u2019s citizens continue to live in poverty and \nare denied a life of dignity and that there are rising inequalities within and among \ncountries and enormous disparities of opportunity, wealth and power, \n \nStressing the lack of strong coordinated international response in dealing with \nthe challenges referred to above, illustrating that the calls made in the Declaration \nand the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic \nOrder are still highly relevant, \n \nUnderlining the need for a more sustainable economic growth and recovery, and \nrecognizing that this goal can be achieved through inclusive multilateralism and the \nequal participation of all countries, as envisioned, inter alia, in the Declaration and \nthe Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic \nOrder, \n \nRecognizing that innovative and enhanced approaches to financing for \ndevelopment are needed to address the challenges posed by the current global \neconomic situation, poverty and the achievement of the internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, and stressing that \nthese approaches should neither be a substitute for nor negatively affect the level of \ntraditional sources of development financing, including official development \nassistance, and that they need to be developed in a spirit of partnership, cooperation \nand solidarity, bearing in mind the common interests and national priorities of each \ncountry, \n \nRecognizing also that many relevant aspects of the Programme of Action on the \nEstablishment of a New International Economic Order have not been implemented \nand that, consequently, many developing countries continue to face significant \nchallenges to their development prospects, including vulnerability to external shocks \nand lack of adequate representation in global economic governance, \n \nRecognizing further the role played by regional, subregional and interregional \ncooperation as well as regional economic integration, based on equality of \npartnership, in strengthening international cooperation with the objective of \nfacilitating economic coordination and cooperation for development, the achievement \nof development goals and the sharing of best practices and knowledge, \n \nRecognizing that widespread financial deregulation has contributed to larger net \ncapital outflows from developing countries to developed countries, \n \nNoting with deep concern the impact of illicit financial flows on the economic, \nsocial and political stability and development of developing countries,  \n \nConcerned that excessively expansionary monetary policies and the ensuing \ncompetitive currency devaluations pursued by developed countries have an effect \n\nA/RES/73/240 \nTowards a New International Economic Order\n \n18-22618\n4/5 \n \nequivalent to an across-the-board export subsidy and a generalized increase in import \ntariffs, which thus nullify or impair existing World Trade Organization market access \ncommitments and further hinder the capacity of developing countries to fulfil their \ncommitments to implement all the internationally agreed development goals, \nincluding the Sustainable Development Goals, \n \nStressing the need for policy space to allow for the formulation of national \ndevelopment strategies by developing countries, aimed at bringing prosperity for all, \n \nConcerned with the increasing protectionist measures and adoption of inward-\nlooking policies that undermine the multilateral trading system and increase the \nvulnerabilities of developing countries, and emphasizing the importance of promoting \nan open world economy and generating greater positive effects of globalization,  \n \nEmphasizing that multilateralism, including a universal, rules-based, open, \ntransparent, predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral \ntrading system, is the most appropriate platform of international cooperation for \naddressing the challenges facing humanity, \n \nConcerned about the financial risks associated with ongoing monetary policy \nadjustments in developed countries, which could induce instability in the international \nmonetary system, leading to exchange rate depreciation and unsustainable levels of \nexternal debt in many developing and emerging economies, \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General;6 \n \n2. \nNotes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 7  the Addis \nAbaba Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment8 and the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change\n9  carry forward many of the ideas and \nrecommendations of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International \nEconomic Order 10 and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New \nInternational Economic Order;11 \n \n3. \nReaffirms the need to continue working towards a new international \neconomic order based on the principles of equity, sovereign equality, \ninterdependence, common interest, cooperation and solidarity among all States;  \n \n4. \nReiterates that States are strongly urged to refrain from promulgating and \napplying any unilateral economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance with \ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations that impede the full \nachievement of economic and social development, particularly in developing \ncountries;  \n \n5. \nReaffirms that national development efforts need to be supported by an \nenabling international economic environment, including coherent and mutually \nsupporting world trade, monetary and financial systems and strengthened and \nenhanced global economic governance, as well as by respect for each country\u2019s policy \nspace;  \n \n6. \nAlso reaffirms the need to step up coordination of macroeconomic policies \namong countries to avoid negative spillover effects, especially in developing \ncountries; \n__________________ \n \n6  A/73/290. \n \n7  Resolution 70/1. \n \n8  Resolution 69/313, annex. \n \n9  See FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1,
