\n \n(b) \nAdopt a comprehensive and intergenerational approach in the design and \nimplementation of care and support systems, taking the care economy into account in \neconomic and social policymaking; \n \n(c) \nCollect quantitative and qualitative sex-disaggregated data and gender \nstatistics on all forms of care work, including through time-use and labour-force \nsurveys, to measure the full extent of paid and unpaid care work and to inform \nevidence-based policymaking; \n\nA/C.2/80/L.30 \n \n25-16862\n4/4 \n \n \n(d) \nRecognize that strategic investments in care infrastructure and services \ncan generate a \u201ctriple dividend\u201d effect by creating new jobs, enabling greater female \nlabour-force participation and improving well-being and human development \noutcomes for society as a whole; \n \n2. \nCalls upon Member States to invest in the care economy and take action \nto recognize paid and unpaid care work, reduce and redistribute unpaid care work \nbetween women and men in the household, and between households, the State, the \nprivate sector and the communities, and reward and represent paid care work by \nexpanding high-quality care services and infrastructure, enacting maternity, paternity \nand parental leave policies and providing allowances and social protection to carers \nand care workers; \n \n3. \nRequests the United Nations system to support, as appropriate and within \nexisting mandates and resources, the efforts of Member States, upon their request, to \ndevelop, strengthen and expand care and support systems as a driver of inclusive and \nsustainable economic growth, gender equality, decent work and poverty eradication, \nincluding through the provision of technical assistance, capacity-building and policy \nadvice, and the integration of care economy considerations into development \ncooperation frameworks; \n \n4. \nEncourages the international community, including development partners, \ninternational financial institutions and public development banks, to support national \nefforts to invest in and strengthen care and support systems, including through \nconcessional finance, technical assistance, capacity-building and knowledge-sharing; \n \n5. \nRequests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its \neighty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution, and \ndecides to include in the provisional agenda of its eighty-second session, under the \nitem entitled \u201cEradication of poverty and other development issues\u201d, a sub-item \nentitled \u201cContribution of the care economy to sustainable development\u201d. \n \n",
