I, Resolutions Adopted by the Conference (United Nations publication, \nSales No. E.93.I.8 and corrigendum), resolution 1, annex I.  \n \n9  Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 2003, Supplement No. 2 (E/2003/22), \nannex IV.  \n \n10  Ibid., 2011, Supplement No. 2 (E/2011/22), annex VI.  \n\nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation \nA/RES/72/178\n \n3/6 \n17-22995 \n \n \nWelcoming the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund in the 2017 update published by their Joint Monitoring Programme \nfor Water Supply and Sanitation,11  \n \nWelcoming also the fact that, according to the Joint Monitoring Programme \nreport, an estimated 71 per cent of the global population uses a safely managed \ndrinking water service system, while being deeply concerned, however, that \n12 per cent of the global population still lacks even a basic drinking water service,  \n \nDeeply concerned that 4.5 billion people lack a safely managed sanitation \nservice, 2.3 billion people still lack even a basic sanitation service and 892 million \npeople worldwide still practise open defecation, which is one of the clearest \nmanifestations of poverty and extreme poverty,  \n \nDeeply concerned also about the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation \nservices and its dramatic consequences for the overall health situation in humanitarian \ncrises, including in times of conflict and natural disaster, acknowledging that people \nliving in countries affected by conflict, violence and instability are four times as likely \nto lack basic drinking water and twice as likely to lack basic sanitation as people \nliving in unaffected countries,  \n \nDeeply concerned further that women and girls often face, especially in \nhumanitarian crises, including in times of conflict or natural disaster, particular \nbarriers in accessing water and sanitation and that they shoulder the main burden of \ncollecting household water in many parts of the world, restricting their time for other \nactivities, such as education and leisure, or for earning a livelihood,  \n \nDeeply concerned that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation \nservices, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, \ncontributes to reinforcing the widespread stigma associated with menstruation, \nnegatively affecting gender equality and women\u2019s and girls\u2019 enjoyment of human \nrights, including the right to education and the right to the enjoyment of the highest \nattainable standard of physical and mental health,  \n \nDeeply concerned also that women and girls are particularly at risk and exposed \nto attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their \nsafety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities \noutside their homes or practising open defecation,  \n \nDeeply alarmed that water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases hit children \nthe hardest and that, in humanitarian crises, including in times of conflict or natural \ndisaster, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, \nand underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is \nlinked to children\u2019s and women\u2019s access to safe drinking water and sanitation,  \n \nWelcoming the fact that the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and \nSanitation has established an extensive global database and has been instrumental in \ndeveloping global norms to benchmark progress, while taking into consideration the \nfact that official figures very often do not fully capture all the dimensions of the \nhuman rights to safe drinking water and sanitation,  \n \nDeeply concerned that non-existent or inadequate sanitation facilities and \nserious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can negatively \naffect water provision and sustainable access to safe drinking water and that, \naccording to the United Nations World Water Development Report 2017, over \n__________________ \n \n11  World Health Organization/United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, Progress on Drinking Water, \nSanitation and Hygiene: 2017 updates and SDG baselines (Geneva, 2017).  \n\nA/RES/72/178 \nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation\n \n17-22995 \n4/6 \n \n80 per cent of the world\u2019s wastewater, and over 95 per cent in some of the least \ndeveloped countries, is released into the environment without treatment,  \n \nAffirming the importance of continually improving the availability of high-\nquality, accessible, timely and reliable disaggregated data on progress related to safe \ndrinking water and sanitation services as an indispensable means for States to plan \nfor, implement and monitor the progressive realization of the human rights to safe \ndrinking water and sanitation for all,  \n \nStressing the importance of monitoring and reporting on the implementation of \nthe internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including the \nGoal on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation \nfor all,  \n \nRecognizing that, in progressively realizing the human rights to safe drinking \nwater and sanitation, as well as other human rights, States should increasingly pursue \nintegrated approaches and strengthen their water resource management, including by \nimproving wastewater treatment and by preventing and reducing surface and \ngroundwater pollution,  \n \nEmphasizing that national legislation and policies are crucial to the progressive \nrealization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation,  \n \nAffirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, \nwhere appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human \nrights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of \ninternational water law, including international watercourse law,  \n \nReaffirming the responsibility of States to ensure the promotion and protection \nof all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, \nand must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with \nthe same emphasis,  \n \nRecalling that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are derived \nfrom the right to an adequate standard of living and are inextricably related to the \nright to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as to the \nright to life and human dignity,  \n \nExpressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to \ncontribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural \ndisasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full \nenjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and \nsanitation,  \n \n1. \nReaffirms that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as \ncomponents of the right to an adequate standard of living, are essential for the full \nenjoyment of the right to life and all human rights;  \n \n2. \nRecognizes that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, \nwithout discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically \naccessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human \nright to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and \naffordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, \nsocially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while \nreaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of \nliving;  \n \n3. \nWelcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights \nCouncil on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and takes note with \n\nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation \nA/RES/72/178\n \n5/6 \n17-22995 \n \nappreciation of his reports on development cooperation,12 as well as his report on \nservice regulation and the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 13  \n \n4. \nCalls upon States:  \n \n(a) \nTo implement the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals \nand targets,14 including the Goal on ensuring the availability and sustainable \nmanagement of water and sanitation for all, consistent with their obligations under \ninternational law;  \n \n(b) \nTo ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking \nwater and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating \ninequalities in access, including for individuals belonging to groups at risk and to \nmarginalized groups, on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, \nreligion and national or social origin or on any other grounds;  \n \n(c)  To continuously monitor and regularly analyse the status of the realization \nof the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation;  \n \n(d) \nTo identify patterns of failure to respect, protect or fulfil the human rights \nto safe drinking water and sanitation for all persons without discrimination and to \naddress their structural causes in policymaking and budgeting within a broader \nframework, while undertaking holistic planning aimed at achieving sustainable \nuniversal access, including in instances where the private sector, donors and \nnon-governmental organizations are involved in service provision;  \n \n(e) \nTo promote both women\u2019s leadership and their full, effective and equal \nparticipation in decision-making on water and sanitation management and to ensure \nthat a gender-based approach is adopted in relation to water and sanitation \nprogrammes, including measures, inter alia, to reduce the time spent by women and \ngirls in collecting household water, in order to address the negative impact of \ninadequate water and sanitation services on the access of girls to education and to \nprotect women and girls from being physically threatened or assaulted, including \nfrom sexual violence, while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation \nfacilities outside of their home or practising open defecation;  \n \n(f) \nTo progressively eliminate open defecation by adopting policies to \nincrease access to sanitation, including for individuals belonging to vulnerable and \nmarginalized groups;  \n \n(g) \nTo approach the sanitation issue in a much broader context, taking into \naccount the need to pursue integrated approaches;  \n \n(h) \nTo consult and coordinate with local communities and other stakeholders, \nincluding civil society and the private sector, on adequate solutions to ensure \nsustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation;  \n \n(i) \nTo enhance efforts to substantially reduce the share of untreated \nwastewater released into the environment and to ensure that plans and programmes \nfor improving sanitation services take into account the need for appropriate systems \nfor the treatment of sewage produced, including disposal of infant faeces, with the \naim of reducing the risks to human health, drinking water resources and the \nenvironment;  \n \n \n__________________ \n \n12  A/71/302 and A/72/127.  \n \n13  A/HRC/36/45.  \n                      14  Resolution 70/1.

providers, including private sector providers, to ensure that they \nrespect human rights and do not cause or contribute to human rights violations or \nabuses;  \n \n5. \nCalls upon non-State actors, including business enterprises, both \ntransnational and others, to comply with their responsibility to respect human rights, \nincluding the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, including by \ncooperating with State investigations into allegations of abuses of the human rights \nto safe drinking water and sanitation, and by progressively engaging with States to \ndetect and remedy abuses of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation;  \n \n6. \nInvites regional and international organizations to complement efforts by \nStates to progressively realize the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation;  \n \n7. \nCalls upon Member States to enhance global partnerships for sustainable \ndevelopment as a means to achieve and sustain the Goals and the targets of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development,14 and highlights that the 2030 Agenda marks a \nparadigm shift towards a more balanced and integrated plan of action for achieving \nsustainable development that reflects the indivisibility and interdependence of all \nhuman rights;  \n \n8. \nReaffirms that the high-level political forum on sustainable development, \nunder the auspices of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, \nhas the central role in overseeing follow-up and review at the global level, and \nencourages Member States to share their experiences and best practices with regard \nto the Goals under review during the 2018 high-level political forum, including the \nGoal of ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation \nfor all;  \n \n9. \nAlso reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full \nrealization of all human rights and to endeavour to take steps, individually and \nthrough international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical \ncooperation, to the maximum of their available resources, with a view to \nprogressively achieving the full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and \nsanitation by all appropriate means, including, in particular, the adoption of \nlegislative measures;  \n \n10. Stresses the important role of the international cooperation and technical \nassistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and \ninternational and development partners, as well as by donor agencies, and urges \ndevelopment partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing and \nimplementing development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans \nof action related to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation;  \n \n11. \nDecides to continue its consideration of the question at its seventy-fourth \nsession. \n \n73rd plenary meeting  \n19 December 2017 \n \n",
