departure from the \nArmistice Line of 1949 and in such a way as to include the great majority of the Israeli \nsettlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and \nwhich is causing humanitarian hardship and a serious decline of socioeconomic \nconditions for the Palestinian people, is fragmenting the territorial contiguity of the \nTerritory and undermining its
