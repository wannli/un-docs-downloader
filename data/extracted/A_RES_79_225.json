resolutions related to the eradication of poverty,  \n \nReaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including \nextreme poverty, which is disproportionately high in rural areas, is the greatest global \nchallenge facing the world today and is an indispensable requirement for sustainable \ndevelopment, particularly in Africa, in the least developed countries, in landlocked \ndeveloping countries, in small island developing States and in some middle-income \ncountries, noting with concern that, as of 2024, approximately 692 million people still \nlive in extreme poverty compounded by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic, the precarious recovery and the continued global crisis of food, finance \nand challenge of energy access, and underlining the importance of accelerating \nsustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, recovery and sustainable \ndevelopment, including full, productive employment and decent work for all, with a \nview to reducing inequalities within and among countries,  \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety \nand well-being caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well

\n3/9\n24-24322 \n \nchallenges in fighting rural poverty and the need for accelerated action towards the \neradication of poverty, and recognizing that addressing rural poverty is fundamental \nfor the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 1 of the 2030 Agenda, as well \nas most of the other Goals, with 70 per cent of the targets requiring action in rural \nareas,  \n \nEmphasizing that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on sustainable \ndevelopment have increased the number of people living in poverty around the world \nand disrupted, inter alia, the normal functioning of open markets, global supply chain \nconnectivity and the flow of essential goods, hindering the fight against poverty and \nadding urgency to the call to galvanize action and delivery for the eradication of \npoverty, in all its forms and dimensions, particularly in rural areas, where most of the \nextreme poor live, and in this regard welcoming the 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2024 \nSustainable Development Goals Moments, placing an emphasis on poverty and \ninequality, on climate change and a healthy planet and on achieving gender equality \nand the empowerment of all women and girls,  \n \nTaking note of the efforts of the President of the General Assembly at its \nseventy-fourth session to launch the Alliance for Poverty Eradication, which is timely \nand meaningful and continues to serve as a platform for the exchange of ideas, \npolicies and best practices on poverty eradication, and stressing the importance of \naddressing poverty, including rural poverty issues, in these forums, as the rural poor \nmight be less prepared to deal with the effects of and recover from the COVID-19 \npandemic and multiple crises and could have less access to adequate sanitation, food \nand nutrition, water, healthcare services, education, the Internet, information and \ncommunications technology, social protection, financial services and public \ninfrastructure,  \n \nCommending the efforts and remarkable progress achieved by developing \ncountries in eradicating rural poverty, while noting with concern that key gaps still \nremain, such as: a lack of adequate data; inadequate investment in agricultural and \nrural development; lower and inadequate human capital formation relevant for rural \nlivelihoods; inadequate income sources, including scarce non-farm income-generating \nopportunities; a lack of productive capacity and agricultural transformation; persistent \ngender inequality; a lack of social protection; insufficient basic infrastructure and \nservices; the lack of public policies that support those efforts, as well as the lack of \nor poor adaptive capacity and resilience to cope with the adverse effects of climate \nchange and disasters; and a lack of effective rural institutions and of sufficient \nresources,  \n \nRecognizing the leading role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations, together with other United Nations entities, including the International \nFund for Agricultural Development, the International Labour Organization and the \nUnited Nations Development Programme, in the global efforts to reduce poverty, \nincluding rural poverty, while addressing other interlinked challenges such as \neliminating hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, and increasing the \nresilience of livelihoods to threats and crises,  \n \nNoting with appreciation the aspirations, embedded in Agenda 2063 of the \nAfrican Union, to lift huge sections of the population out of poverty, improve incomes \nand catalyse economic and social transformation, and recognizing the importance of \nthe international community\u2019s involvement and cooperation with African countries to \nachieve such goals, especially in the rural areas of the African continent,  \n \nNoting that, while considerable progress has been made over the past decade \nacross all areas of development, the pace of progress observed in recent years is \ninsufficient and uneven to fully meet the Sustainable Development Goals and targets \n\nA/RES/79/225 \nEradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development\n \n24-24322\n4/9 \n \nby 2030, especially in the area of rural poverty eradication, and that it is projected \nthat there will still be almost 600 million people living in extreme poverty in 2030,  \n \nRecognizing that poverty is a serious impediment to the achievement of gender \nequality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including those living in rural \nareas, and that the feminization of poverty persists, emphasizing that the eradication \nof poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is an \nindispensable requirement for sustainable development, acknowledging the mutually \nreinforcing links between the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment \nof all women and girls and the eradication of poverty, and stressing the importance of \nsupport for countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms and \ndimensions,  \n \nNoting that, without targeted interventions tackling the structural causes of rural \npoverty, the objectives of the 2030 Agenda will remain unattainable,  \n \nEmphasizing that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda depends crucially on \nthe transformation of rural areas, where most of the poor and hungry live, and that, in \norder to eradicate rural poverty, investment should be encouraged in those sectors that \nhave a bigger impact, such as education and health, including school feeding \nprogrammes, social protection, agriculture and infrastructure, while noting the \nfinancing gap between resources dedicated to the education sector and the amount \nnecessary to reach Sustainable Development Goal 4, and that at least several trillion \nUnited States dollars in substantial investments could be needed to meet the demand \nfor food that is projected to increase by 50 per cent between 2012 and 2050, and that \nthe investments that are needed for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and loss \nand damage also remain underfunded,  \n \nNoting with great concern that extreme weather events, and slow-onset \nprocesses, such as increasing temperature, desertification and loss of biodiversity, \ndisproportionately affect the poor and people in vulnerable situations, many of whom \nreside in rural areas in low- and middle-income countries and depend on agriculture \nand natural resources for their livelihoods,  \n \nRecalling the proclamation of 2019\u20132028 as the United Nations Decade of \nFamily Farming, to raise the profile of the role of family farming4 in contributing to \nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and reaffirming the importance of the United \nNations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016\u20132025) in the promotion of activities \ntowards the eradication of rural poverty, \n \nRecognizing the interlinkages and integrated nature of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, and reiterating that the eradication of rural poverty and hunger \nis crucial for the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including \nthose contained in the 2030 Agenda, and that rural development should be pursued \nthrough an integrated approach that encompasses economic, social and environmental \ndimensions, takes into account a gender perspective and consists of mutually \nreinforcing policies and programmes, and that should be balanced, targeted, situation-\nspecific and locally owned, include local synergies and initiatives and be responsive \nto the needs of rural populations,  \n \nRecalling that more than three quarters of the extreme poor lived in rural areas \nin 2022 and worked in agriculture and that the extreme poverty rate in rural areas is \nthree times higher than in urban areas, and recognizing that devoting resources to the \ndevelopment of rural areas and sustainable agriculture and supporting smallholder \nfarmers, especially women farmers, is key to ending poverty in all its forms and \ndimensions, by, inter alia, improving the welfare of farmers,

consideration the increasing number of young people who decide to \nleave rural areas for more urbanized ones and the challenges that this trend poses to \nthe livelihood of rural families,  \n \nExpressing its concern that the extreme poor have limited access to productive \nresources, basic health, Internet and digital technologies, education and social \nprotection services, basic infrastructure such as roads, water and electricity, and off-\nfarm employment opportunities, and are susceptible to the impacts of natural hazards, \nespecially weather-related hazards, including the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, and the \nadverse effects of climate change, and that rural women and girls fare far worse on \nmost development indicators,  \n \nEmphasizing the importance of enhancing global support for national work on \nrural development policies and strategies, including on commodity production as well \nas increased public and private investments to upgrade productive capacity, and that \ntackling rural poverty requires integrated, cross-sectoral, multi-stakeholder and \ncontext-specific interventions, with a strong emphasis on sustainable food and \nagricultural systems for food security, and nutrition, economic growth, revitalization \nand development, and social protection in rural areas,  \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General5 and the recommendations \ncontained therein; \n \n2. \nReaffirms that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, \nincluding extreme poverty, for all people everywhere, is the greatest global challenge \nand an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, as well as an \noverarching objective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 6 of which \nthe Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing \nfor Development7 is an integral part, supporting and complementing it; \n \n3. \nExpresses its deep concern that the progress in reducing poverty remains \nuneven, with 1.1 billion people still living in multidimensional poverty, 84 per cent \nof whom live in rural areas, and that this number continues to be significant and \nunacceptably high, whereas the levels of inequality in income, wealth and \nopportunities remain high or are increasing in a number of countries, and the \nnon-income dimensions of poverty and deprivation, such as access to inclusive and \nequitable quality education or basic health services, and relative poverty remain major \nconcerns, and stresses the importance of national and global efforts to create the \nconditions for achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions, economic, \nsocial and environmental, sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, \nshared prosperity and decent work for all in society, taking into account different \nlevels of national development capacities; \n \n4. \nRecognizes the importance of promoting socioeconomic development in \nrural areas as an effective strategy and important means at the global level for the \neradication of poverty, including extreme poverty, and therefore underlines the \nimportance of shaping a rural poverty eradication pattern with the concerted efforts \nof the whole of society to promote socioeconomic development in rural areas and \ncreate sound policy frameworks at the local, national, regional and international levels \nbased on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies to support accelerated \ninvestment in poverty eradication action; \n \n5. \nEmphasizes that economic

countries reveal that \nAfrica and South Asia account for the highest number of multidimensionally poor \npeople, and recommends that countries promote dedicated and coordinated social, \neconomic, agricultural and rural development in their national policies, including by \nadopting rural-focused poverty eradication strategies in alignment with the 2030 \nAgenda, social policies aimed at improving human capital in rural areas and ensuring \naccess to adequate social protection coverage, agricultural policies aimed at boosting \nagricultural productivity, and rural development policies aimed at improving access \nto rural infrastructure and basic services of high quality and at boosting non-farm \nemployment opportunities;  \n \n6. \nRecognizes the critical role and contribution of rural women, including \nsmallholders and women farmers, fishers, Indigenous women and their traditional \nknowledge and women in local communities, in enhancing agricultural and rural \ndevelopment, improving food security and nutrition and eradicating rural poverty, and \ntherefore highlights the importance of promoting their economic empowerment, their \nfull access to land ownership and decent work and economic opportunities and their \nparticipation in decision-making; \n \n7. \nStresses the importance of establishing and implementing targeted policies \nand measures to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme \npoverty, by formulating rural development strategies with clear poverty eradication \ngoals, strengthening national statistical capacity and monitoring systems, including \ninnovative use of telephone surveys and high-resolution data facilitated by remote \nsensing, and implementing nationally appropriate social protection systems and \nmeasures for all, and taking concrete actions to prevent the return to poverty, \nespecially when recent years have witnessed a sharp setback in poverty reduction, \nwith a view to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions, economic, \nsocial and environmental, and building the resilience of the poor and those in \nvulnerable situations; \n \n8. \nEncourages all countries and other relevant stakeholders to promote \ninclusive economic transformation in rural areas that increases productivity and \ncontributes to bridging the present rural-urban divide while ensuring productive \nemployment and decent work, access to reliable and appropriate social protection \nsystems, inclusive and equitable quality education and skills training, healthcare \nservices, quality, resilient and sustainable infrastructure, roads and telecommunications, \nand financial inclusion and support, as well as preparedness planning for crises and \nearly warning, reiterates that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the important \nrole of digital connectivity and access and the potential of e-commerce and e-learning \nsolutions for poverty eradication, and thus calls upon all stakeholders to strengthen \ndigital, information and communications technology, science, technology and \ninnovation cooperation on mutually agreed terms, especially in the area of \ne-commerce, financial technology (fintech), affordable and reliable Internet \nconnectivity and digital infrastructure investment and construction to keep food and \nagriculture supply chains functioning and achieve momentum under the 2030 Agenda \nfor an inclusive, sustainable and resilient recovery for global development, putting \npeople at the centre of the response, protecting our planet and achieving prosperity, \nwith no one left behind, in line with the 2030 Agenda; \n \n9. \nRecognizes that eradicating poverty in rural areas cannot be separated from \nthe sustainable transformation and strengthening of food systems, strengthening the \nresilience of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises in the agrifood sector, \nbuilding sustainable linkages between micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, \nlarger-scale business partners and support institutions to help micro-, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises to increase their competitiveness through economies of \nscale, use of shared services such as industrial parks, and access to training, expertise \n\nEradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development \nA/RES/79/225\n \n7/9\n24-24322 \n \nand knowledge, and that ensuring fair markets that enable the participation of \nsmallholder and family farmers in food systems, particularly in value chains where \nsmall-scale producers have a comparative advantage, will continue to be important, \nand in this regard takes note with appreciation of the United Nations Food Systems \nSummit, held in 2021, which recognized the transformative effects of sustainable food \nsystems as a driver for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by \n2030; \n \n10. Underscores that promoting a universal, rules-based, open, transparent, \npredictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system \nunder the World Trade Organization is essential for building sustainable, inclusive \nand resilient food systems, and thus stresses the importance of keeping trade channels \nand markets open, equitable, transparent, non-discriminatory and predictable for the \nmovement of food, fertilizer and other agricultural inputs and outputs and access to \nenergy, and emphasizes the urgent need to combat protectionism in all its forms and \nto correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions that are inconsistent with \nWorld Trade Organization rules in world agricultural markets;  \n \n11. Notes with great concern that the poorest population spends a larger share \nof income on food, which means extreme food price volatility can have devastating \nimpacts, and is a driver of increased poverty, particularly in rural areas;  \n \n12. Calls upon all countries to promote agricultural and rural development in \ntheir national policies and renew their efforts to promote innovative approaches, \nincluding agroecology, among other approaches, to enhance capacity for food \nproduction, distribution and storage, cooperate in the relevant areas of science, \nresearch, technology and innovation, as appropriate and consistent with national \npolicies and frameworks, to strengthen sustainable agrifood systems that enhance \nfood security and nutrition, including sustainable productivity growth, significantly \nreducing food loss and waste, and strengthen policies that support small-scale \nproducers in engaging in agrifood system value chains;  \n \n13. Recognizes the importance of employment and education for pro-poor \ngrowth in rural areas, and encourages the United Nations system and development \npartners to assist countries, upon their request, in mainstreaming employment into \ninvestment policy and poverty reduction strategies, including those focused on rural \narea development, and fostering rapid agricultural productivity growth, especially in \ndeveloping countries, by increasing investment in agricultural and related rural off-\nfarm activities and strengthening capacity-building for agricultural producers; \n \n14. Also recognizes the essential role of inclusive and sustainable industrial \ndevelopment, which can diversify income opportunities as part of a comprehensive \nstrategy of structural economic transformation in eradicating poverty in all its forms \nand dimensions, especially in rural areas, supporting inclusive, sustained and \nsustainable economic growth, and thus in contributing to achieving sustainable \ndevelopment in developing countries, and calls upon international industrial \ncooperation to advance inclusive and sustainable industrialization and innovation and \nhelp developing countries to improve industrial production capacity; \n \n15. Further recognizes the need to design, implement and pursue gender-\nresponsive economic and social policies aimed at, inter alia, eradicating poverty, \nincluding in rural areas, and combating the feminization of poverty, ensuring the full \nand equal participation of rural women in the development, implementation and \nfollow-up of development policies and programmes and poverty eradication \nstrategies, supporting increased rural employment and decent work and the \nredistribution of unpaid domestic and care work as well as care systems, and \npromoting the full, equal and meaningful participation and leadership of women at all \n\nA/RES/79/225 \nEradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development\n \n24-24322\n8/9 \n \nlevels and sectors of the rural economy and in diverse on-farm and off-farm economic \nactivities, including sustainable agricultural and fisheries production; \n \n16. Encourages Member States, international organizations, the private sector \nand other partners to develop programmes to foster the creation of decent work in \nrural areas and increase the investment in agricultural and related off-farm activities, \nespecially for young people, including through economic diversification in rural \nareas, development of value chain across all stages, the promotion of sustainable \nagrifood systems and a balanced territorial approach, along a continuum that includes \nintermediate settlements and cities nested amid agricultural zones, with varying levels \nof agglomeration, as a key to reducing rural poverty and persistent inequalities \nbetween urban, peri-urban and rural areas; \n \n17. Emphasizes that, globally, 1.4 billion people, primarily in rural areas in \ndeveloping countries, do not have access to formal financial products and services, \nand encourages further efforts of the international community to offer affordable ways \nto access finance, including through financial education and training on the effective \nuse of financial instruments, for the financially excluded in rural areas; \n \n18. Also emphasizes the need to increase investment, including through \nenhanced international cooperation, in quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient rural \ninfrastructure, especially in roads, water, sanitation, electricity and Internet \nconnectivity, and to provide an inclusive and sustainable digital transformation;  \n \n19. Expresses its commitment to raising public awareness to promote the \neradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, in \nall countries, to mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of all stakeholders, \nespecially the rural residents living in extreme poverty, to fight against poverty, to \npromoting their active participation in the design and implementation of programmes \nand policies that affect them, and to providing quality education for the rural poor, \nwith the aim of achieving the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals; \n \n20. Reiterates the need for enhanced and expanded access on mutually agreed \nterms by developing countries to appropriate technologies that are pro-poor and raise \nproductivity, and underlines the need for measures to increase investment in \nagriculture, including modern technologies, as well as in natural resources \nmanagement and capacity-building of developing countries;  \n \n21. Stresses that the achievement of sustainable development and the \neradication of poverty also hinge on the ability and readiness of countries to \neffectively mobilize domestic resources, attract foreign direct investment, fulfil \nofficial development assistance commitments and use official development assistance \neffectively, and facilitate the transfer of technology to developing countries, on \nmutually agreed terms, and further stresses that the resolution of unsustainable debt \nsituations is critical for heavily indebted poor countries, while remittances have \nbecome a significant source of income and finance for receiving economies and their \ncontribution to the achievement of sustainable development;  \n \n22. Recognizes the importance of addressing the diverse needs of and \nchallenges faced by countries in special situations, in particular African countries, the \nleast developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island \ndeveloping States, as well as the specific challenges facing many middle-income \ncountries, and therefore requests the United Nations development system, the \ninternational financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders to \nensure that these diverse and specific development needs are appropriately considered \nand addressed, in a tailored fashion, in their relevant strategies and policies, with a \nview to promoting a coherent and comprehensive approach towards individual \ncountries; \n\nEradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development \nA/RES/79/225\n \n9/9\n24-24322 \n \n \n23. Realizes that bridging the digital divides will require strong commitment \nby all relevant stakeholders at the national and international levels, reiterates the \nimportance of investing in infrastructure for greater access to affordable technological \ndevices and services for rural populations, which includes leveraging technology-\nenabled financial services and financial technologies to promote financial inclusion, \nand encourages efforts by all relevant stakeholders, especially United Nations \nagencies, funds and programmes, in the spirit of win-win cooperation, to assist \ndeveloping countries in overcoming the digital divides and promoting the use of \ninformation and communications technologies to foster economic and social \ndevelopment, particularly in rural areas, with the aim of building a shared future for \nhumankind;  \n \n24. Recognizes the devastating impact of diseases on societies, and calls for \nmeasures by relevant United Nations bodies, in accordance with their respective \nmandates, and other stakeholders to make good use of their experience and \nadvantages to further help developing countries with the aim of improving rural \ndevelopment planning, including poverty eradication and multisectoral development \nactivities covering economic and social aspects, including a gender perspective; \n \n25. Reiterates the urgent need to accelerate the pace of rural poverty \neradication, and requests the Secretary-General, in close collaboration with the \nsecretariat of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, as well as \nother relevant international organizations, to submit to the General Assembly at its \neightieth session a report on the status of the implementation of and follow-up to the \npresent resolution in order to identify the progress achieved, gaps and challenges \nfaced in rural poverty eradication, especially in developing countries, and to list rural \npoverty eradication as a priority for an annual Sustainable Development Goals \nMoment to highlight inspiring action on the Goals, in the context of the general debate \nof the Assembly;  \n \n26.
