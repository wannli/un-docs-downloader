678.1 million in 2018, and that global nutrition challenges are increasingly \ncomplex as multiple forms of malnutrition, including stunting, wasting, underweight, \nmicronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity, may coexist within the same \ncountry or household,  \n \nNoting with great concern the threat to human health, safety and well-being \ncaused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the severe \ndisruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives and \nlivelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the \npandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals by designing sustainable and inclusive recovery strategies to \naccelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda and to help \nto reduce the risk of future shocks, and recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic \nrequires a global response based on unity, solidarity and renewed multilateral \ncooperation,  \n \nRecognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest global \nchallenges in the history of the United Nations and its impacts, as well as the \nextraordinary measures adopted to combat it, may have increased vulnerabilities in \nfood systems, which could raise the risk of food insecurity and malnutrition and \nexacerbates inequalities in access to healthy diets, deeply concerned about the \npreliminary assessment suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic, under different \neconomic growth scenarios, could add between 83 million and 132 million people to \nthe total number of undernourished in the world in 2020, especially in Asia, parts of \nLatin America and Africa, where malnutrition is estimated to affect one in five people, \nand about the estimation that more than 2 billion small producers, farm labourers, \nfamily farmers, smallholder farmers and other people in vulnerable situations, as well \nas women and children, who represent a large proportion of the moderately and \nseverely food insecure, may be disproportionately affected, recognizing that hundreds \nof millions of people were already suffering from hunger and malnutrition before the \nvirus hit, underlining that the impact of the pandemic is exacerbating existing high \nlevels of acute food insecurity and humanitarian needs, and highlighting the \nimportance of reducing food loss and waste,  \n \nRecognizing also that economic slowdown, gender inequalities, conflict, \ndrought and the adverse effects of climate change, including more frequent and \nextreme weather events, are among the key factors contributing to a reversal in the \nlong-term progress in fighting global hunger, making the prospect of ending hunger \nand all forms of malnutrition by 2030 more difficult, \n \nRemaining deeply concerned about the continuing food insecurity and \nmalnutrition being faced by hundreds of millions of people, in particular in \nsub-Saharan Africa, in South and West Asia and in parts of Latin America,  \n \nRecognizing the need to prevent the recurrence in the future of deaths of people \nfrom famine,  \n \nExpressing its concern about the growing number of obese adults in the world, \nfrom 563.7 million in 2012 to 672.3 million in 2016,  \n \nExpressing concern that, according to the Global Report on Food Crises 2020, \nabout 135 million people face crisis-level food insecurity or worse in countries \naffected by, inter alia, conflict, and exacerbated by climate-related events, \nenvironmental factors, including natural disasters such as locust infestation, and \nextreme food price volatility,  \n \nNoting that an increasing number of countries, in particular in Africa, Asia, \nLatin America and the Pacific, are integrating food security and nutrition into their \nagriculture policies and investment plans and that, as a result, eradicating hunger, \n\nAgriculture development, food security and nutrition \nA/RES/75/235\n \n7/14\n20-17653 \n \nimproving food security and ensuring adequate nutrition are being given greater \nprominence in regional development strategies, such as the African Union Malabo \nDeclaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation for Shared \nProsperity and Improved Livelihoods, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nfood security and nutrition strategy, the Piura Declaration on Food Security, the \nFramework for Multi-Year Programme on Food Security and Climate Change and the \nStrategic Framework on Rural-Urban Development to Strengthen Food Security and \nQuality Growth, adopted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Hunger-Free \nLatin America and the Caribbean 2025 Initiative, the strategy on food security and \nnutrition of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, the Arab food security \ninitiative, the initiative for the Adaptation of African Agriculture to Climate Change \nand the climate-smart agriculture strategy for the Central American Integration \nSystem region (2018\u20132030), all of which emphasized the importance of investing in \nagriculture, diversifying food production and diets and providing quality nutritional \neducation to consumers, introducing labour-saving technologies in food production \nand processing, enhancing women\u2019s access to income and strengthening capacity-\nbuilding in improving food safety at all stages of the food chain, and noting also the \nestablishment of the Islamic Organization for Food Security, headquartered in Nur-\nSultan, \n \nReiterating the urgent need for action to enhance efforts to build resilience, \nespecially for the most vulnerable, by investing in resilience, including disaster risk \nreduction, strengthening adaptation strategies and enhancing joint risk assessments \nand risk management strategies, to cut the impact and cost of natural disasters to \naddress the adverse effects of climate change on food security, in particular for \nwomen, youth, older persons, indigenous peoples, local communities and persons \nwith disabilities, as well as the other root causes of food insecurity and all forms of \nmalnutrition,  \n \nExpressing concern that climate change will disproportionately impact people \nin vulnerable situations, especially women and children, and their livelihoods, \nultimately putting hundreds of millions of people at risk, and that by 2050, the risk of \nhunger and child malnutrition could increase by up to 20 per cent owing to climate \nchange,  \n \nReiterating the importance of achieving gender equality and the empowerment \nof women and girls, as well as the recognition and protection of the rights of \nsmallholders, particularly women, reiterating also the importance, inter alia, of \nsupporting the empowerment of rural women, youth, small-scale farmers, family \nfarmers and livestock farmers, fishers and fish workers as critical agents for \nenhancing agricultural and rural development and food security and for improving \nnutrition outcomes, and acknowledging their fundamental contribution to the \nenvironmental sustainability and the genetic preservation of agricultural systems and \nto sustaining productivity on often marginal lands,  \n \nRecognizing that livestock contributes 40 per cent of the global value of \nagricultural output and supports the livelihoods and food security of almost 1.3 billion \npeople, and in this regard acknowledging that the sector offers opportunities for \nagricultural development, poverty eradication and food security gains, and offers an \nopportunity for raising climate awareness,  \n \nAcknowledging that social protection programmes and measures are effective in \nreducing poverty and hunger,  \n \nNoting the importance of initiatives under the United Nations system, including \nthe observance of World Pulses Day, World Tuna Day, Sustainable Gastronomy Day, \nWorld Bee Day, World Food Safety Day, World Soil Day, the International Year of \nCamelids, the International Year of Plant Health, the International Year of Fruits and \n\nA/RES/75/235 \nAgriculture development, food security and

\nDevelopment\u201d, 2018\u20132028, and the United Nations Decade of Family Farming \n(2019\u20132028), aimed at increasing public awareness of relevant agriculture, food \nsecurity and nutritional benefits, in accordance with General Assembly resolutions \n53/199 of 15 December 1998 and 61/185 of 20 December 2006 on the proclamation \nof international years and Economic and Social Council resolution 1980/67 of 25 July \n1980 on international years and anniversaries, \n \nRecognizing the need to increase responsible public and private investments and \npartnerships in the agriculture sector, inter alia, to find inclusive solutions to and fight \nhunger and malnutrition and to promote rural and urban sustainable development,  \n \nRecalling the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030 and \nits guiding principles,27 and recalling also its promotion of regular disaster risk \npreparedness, prevention, response and recovery exercises, at the national and local \nlevels, with a view to ensuring rapid and effective response to disasters and related \ndisplacement, including access to essential food and non-food relief supplies, as \nappropriate to local needs,  \n \nNoting that in 2011, an initial estimate reported that one third of the food \nproduced annually in the world for human consumption, equivalent to some 1.3 billion \ntons, was lost or wasted, while it is estimated that there are nearly 690 million people \nin the world who are hungry and that nearly 144 million children under 5 years of age \nwere affected by stunting in 2019,  \n \nRecalling that the Sustainable Development Goals and targets are integrated and \nindivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development, and \nacknowledging that reaching Goal 2 and the interlinked targets of other Goals will be \ncritical, inter alia, in ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition,  \n \nReiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind, reaffirming the \nrecognition that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, and the wish to see \nthe Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society, \nand recommitting to endeavour to reach the furthest behind first,  \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General;28  \n \n2. \nUrges Member States and other relevant stakeholders to advance \ncollective

consideration to this issue while implementing \nthe internationally agreed development goals, in particular the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development29 and its Sustainable Development Goals; \n \n4. \nEmphasizes that sustainable agricultural production, food security, food \nsafety and nutrition are key elements for the eradication of poverty in all its forms \nand dimensions, and calls for greater efforts to sustainably enhance the agricultural \nproduction capacities, productivity and food security of developing countries;  \n \n5. \nAlso emphasizes the need to accelerate and scale up action, as appropriate, \nto strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of food systems and people\u2019s \nlivelihoods in response to climate variability and extremes to achieve a world without \nhunger and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030;  \n \n6. \nExpresses concern that the world is not on track to eradicate hunger and \nmalnutrition by 2030 and that scarce and unsustainably managed natural resources, \ncombined with insecure and uneven tenure rights for smallholders, are severely \naffecting those in vulnerable situations in rural areas, that the adverse effects of \nclimate change, including persistent and recurring drought, floods, extreme weather \nevents, land degradation, coastal erosion, ocean acidification, the retreat of mountain \nglaciers, sea level rise and
