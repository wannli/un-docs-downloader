Consumer product safety \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecalling its resolution 70/186 of 22 December 2015 on consumer protection, \nin which it adopted the revised United Nations guidelines for consumer protection, \nsetting out the main characteristics of effective consumer protection legislation, \nenforcement institutions and redress systems, \n \nTaking note of the mandate entrusted to the United Nations Conference on Trade \nand Development at its fifteenth session in the Bridgetown Covenant, 1 to continue to \nassist developing countries to formulate and implement competition and consumer \nprotection policies and laws, facilitate cooperation among competition and consumer \nprotection agencies, conduct peer reviews and foster the exchange of knowledge and \nbest practices, including through multilateral forums, such as the Intergovernmental \nGroup of Experts on Competition Law and Policy and the Intergovernmental Group \nof Experts on Consumer Protection Law and Policy, and by contributing to the \nimplementation of the outcome of the United Nations Conferences to Review All \nAspects of the Set of Multilaterally Agreed Equitable Principles and Rules for the \nControl of Restrictive Business Practices and of the revised United Nations guidelines \nfor consumer protection, \n \nAffirming the right of all consumers to have access to safe products and the need \nto provide consumers, including those in vulnerable and disadvantaged situations, \nwith a high level of protection against unsafe products both online and offline, \nparticularly in countries with less developed product safety frameworks, \n_______________ \n \n1 TD/541/Add.2. \n\nA/RES/80/119 \nConsumer product safety\n \n25-20734\n2/8 \n \n \nAffirming also that products

challenges in cross-border consumer \nprotection enforcement arising from the evolving online environment, \n \nReaffirming that measures to ensure the health and safety of consumers should \nnot create unnecessary obstacles to trade or be more trade-restrictive than necessary, \nconsistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization, \n \nRecalling that the World Health Organization defines \u201chealth\u201d as a state of \ncomplete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease \nor infirmity, \n \nRecognizing that consumers often face imbalances in economic terms, \neducational levels and bargaining power, and may find themselves vulnerable to \nunsafe products, \n \nReaffirming that product safety contributes to building trust in economic \noperators and markets and reduces costs to society associated with injuries, ill health, \ndeaths and property loss, and thereby contributes to economic development, \n \nRecognizing that product safety plays a critical role in sustainable consumption \nand that sustainable products should also be safe, conscious of the role that the \ncircular economy will play in addressing environmental, climate and biodiversity \nchallenges, and recognizing the interlinkages between health, safety and \nenvironmental risks, \n \nAffirming the importance of setting general product safety principles to assist all \nMember States with formulating and enforcing domestic and regional product safety \nframeworks, including policies, laws, rules and regulations, among others, \n \nRecognizing the importance of building local, national, regional and \ninternational cooperation in the area of product safety, \n \nHaving regard to the recommendation on preventing the cross-border \ndistribution of known unsafe consumer products adopted by the Eighth United \nNations Conference to Review All Aspects of the Set of Multilaterally Agreed \nEquitable Principles and Rules for the Control of Restrictive Business Practices,2 \nwhich encourages Member States to pursue policies, consistent with World Trade \nOrganization obligations, aimed at preventing the cross-border distribution of \nconsumer products known in their own jurisdiction to be unsafe, \n \nRecognizing the informal working group on consumer product safety, \nestablished at the third session of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on \nConsumer Protection Law and Policy, under the auspices of the United Nations \nConference on Trade and Development, and aimed at strengthening consumer product \nsafety frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, to protect \nconsumers from hazards to their health, and on recommending policy options for \naddressing challenges faced by consumer protection authorities in this area, \n \nNoting that the informal working group has focused its efforts on \u201cconsumer \nproducts\u201d, understood to mean the category of products intended for and/or likely to \nbe used by consumers, excluding food, drugs and medical devices, as these products \nare often subject to particular risk assessment and risk management procedures in \ndistinct regulatory frameworks, \n_______________ \n \n2 TD/RBP/CONF.9/9, sect.
