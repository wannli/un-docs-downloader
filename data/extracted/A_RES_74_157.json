constantly evolving and where targeted \ndisinformation and smear campaigns to discredit the work of journalists are \nincreasing, \n \nRecognizing further that the work of journalists often puts them and their family \nmembers at specific risk of intimidation, threats, harassment and violence, which \noften deters journalists from continuing their work or encourages self-censorship, \nconsequently

that ensuring accountability for \ncrimes committed against journalists is a key element in preventing future attacks, \n \nRecalling in this regard that journalists, media professionals and

specific risks faced by women journalists in relation \nto their work, in non-conflict as well as in armed conflict situations, where they \ncontinue to be targeted at alarming rates, underlining in this context the importance \nof taking a gender-sensitive approach when considering measures to address the \nsafety of journalists and media workers, including in the online sphere, in particular \nto effectively tackle gender-based discrimination, violence, abuse and harassment, \nincluding sexual harassment, threats and intimidation, as well as inequality and \ngender-based stereotypes, to
