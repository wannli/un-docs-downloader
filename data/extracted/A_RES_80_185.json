persons in all its forms, \nincluding for the purposes of forced or compulsory labour, particularly of women \nmigrant workers, and in this regard taking note of the adoption by the International \nLabour Conference on 11 June 2014, at its 103rd session, of the Protocol to the Forced \nLabour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), and of Recommendation No. 203 on \nsupplementary measures for the effective suppression of forced labour, of the \nInternational Labour Organization, \n \nRecognizing also the increasing participation of women of all skill levels in \ninternational migration, driven in large part by socioeconomic factors and the increase \nin demand for migrant care work, and that some migrant workers engaged in informal \ncare work, particularly women, face serious human rights abuses owing to the \ninvisible nature of their workplace, while many benefit from the economic \nopportunities offered by care work, and that this feminization of migration requires \ngreater gender sensitivity in all policies and efforts related to the subject of \ninternational migration, \n \nAcknowledging that a significant proportion of migrant women are engaged in \ndomestic work, and, as highlighted in the 2022 report of the International Labour \nOrganization entitled Making the Right to Social Security a Reality for Domestic \nWorkers: A Global Review of Policy Trends, Statistics

annex I, decision 42/I. \n \n20 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2220, No. 39481. \n \n21 CMW/C/GC/1. \n\nViolence against women migrant workers \nA/RES/80/185\n \n5/15\n25-20998 \n \n \nRecognizing further the contribution of women migrant workers to the \ndevelopment of their families, inter alia, through the delivery of remittances, \n \nRecognizing the valuable contributions of migrant women, including women \nmigrant workers, on the front lines of the responses to public health emergencies, \nincluding the coronavirus disease (COVID\u201119) pandemic, where migrant workers, \nincluding women migrant workers, were among those who were in vulnerable \nsituations owing to the negative effects of the pandemic and in many cases made up \na disproportionate share of the workforce in sectors that remained open throughout \nthe health emergency,  \n \nRecognizing also the particular vulnerability and needs of women and their \nchildren at all stages of the migration process, extending from the moment of deciding \nto migrate, and including transit, engagement in formal and informal employment and \nintegration into the host society, as well as during their return to and reintegration in \ntheir countries of origin, \n \nExpressing deep concern at the continuing reports of grave abuses and violence \ncommitted against migrant women and girls, including gender-based violence, sexual \nviolence, sexual exploitation and abuse, domestic violence, gender-related killing of \nwomen and girls, including femicide, racist and xenophobic acts and expressions, \ndiscrimination, abusive labour practices, exploitative conditions of work and \ntrafficking in persons, including forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar \nto slavery, while taking into account the particular difficulties in accessing justice that \nmay be faced by women migrant workers, \n \nRecognizing that one of the key causes of the labour exploitation suffered by \nmigrants, including women migrant workers, is linked to the unscrupulous practices \nof some recruitment agencies and informal brokers that charge high recruitment costs \nand related fees, and noting with concern the reports of abuse committed by some \nrecruitment agencies and employers, \n \nRecognizing also that violence against women and girls, in particular migrant \nwomen, is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between \nwomen and men, which further reinforces gender stereotypes and barriers to the full \nenjoyment by women and girls of their human rights, \n \nRecognizing further that the intersection of, inter alia, age, class, race, disability \nand gender-based and ethnic discrimination and stereotypes can compound the \ndiscrimination faced by women migrant workers, and that gender-based violence is a \nform of discrimination, \n \nReaffirming the commitment to respect, protect and promote the human rights \nof all women, including, without discrimination, Indigenous women who migrate for \nwork, and in this regard noting the attention paid in the United Nations Declaration \non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples22 to the full protection and guarantees against all \nforms of violence and discrimination against Indigenous women, as appropriate, \n \nStressing the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination that may be faced \nby Indigenous migrant women, who suffer at a disproportionately high rate from \ndomestic violence and sexual abuse, and as victims of trafficking in persons, \n \nNoting with concern that the availability and flexibility of pathways for safe and \nregular migration remain limited in many cases, and in this regard noting with concern \nalso the increased risk of violence for women migrant workers, \n_______________ \n \n22 Resolution 61/295, annex. \n\nA/RES/80/185 \nViolence against women migrant workers\n \n25-20998\n6/15 \n \n \nConcerned that many migrant women who are employed in the informal \neconomy and in less skilled work are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, \nunderlining in this regard the obligation of States to protect the human rights of \nmigrants so as to prevent and address abuse and exploitation, observing with concern \nthat many women migrant workers take on jobs for which they may be overqualified \nand in which, at the same time, they may be more vulnerable because of poor pay and \ninadequate social protection, and in this regard taking note of the adoption by the \nInternational Labour Conference on 12 June 2015, at its 104th session, of \nRecommendation No. 204 concerning the transition from the informal to the formal \neconomy, \n \nConcerned also that migrant women in informal employment may benefit from \nonly limited legal protection of their labour rights, increasing the risk of exploitation, \n \nConcerned further that women migrants, including those with irregular \nmigration status, are more likely to be forced to work under deplorable working \nconditions and tend to experience discrimination, coercion, violence, abuse and the \nthreat of arrest, deportation and family separation caused by perpetrators, who use \nthese as means of exerting control over them, \n \nEmphasizing the need for objective, comprehensive and broad-based \ninformation, including sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics, indicators for \nresearch and analysis, and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by \nindividual Member States and civil society in the formulation of targeted policies and \nconcrete strategies to specifically address violence against women migrant workers, \nincluding in the context of discrimination, \n \nRealizing that the movement of a significant number of women migrant workers \nmay be facilitated and made possible by means of fraudulent or irregular \ndocumentation and sham marriages with the object of migration, that this may be \nfacilitated through, inter alia, the Internet and that those women migrant workers are \nmore vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, \n \nRecognizing the importance of exploring the link between migration and \ntrafficking in persons in order to further efforts towards protecting women migrant \nworkers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse and to provide \nappropriate care, assistance and services for trafficking victims, regardless of \nmigratory status, \n \nRecognizing also that women migrant workers experience a higher risk of \ntrafficking in persons and that traffickers often use technology, including social media \nplatforms and artificial intelligence, such as deepfake technology, to profile, recruit, \ncontrol and exploit women migrant workers, including for the purposes of sexual \nexploitation, \n \nExpressing grave concern that, while access to digital technologies is crucial, \nall forms of violence, including gender-based violence, that occur through or are \namplified by the use of technology directed towards women migrant workers, \nincluding online harassment and abuse, are an affront to their dignity and could affect \ntheir health, well-being and economic security, and expressing grave concern also at \nthe use of technology for extortion and for the broadcasting of sexual violence \nperpetrated by smugglers to the community of migrant women, further stigmatizing \nand degrading women migrants, \n \nReaffirming the need to close all digital divides, including the gender digital \ndivide, and to ensure that the benefits of digital technologies are available to all \nmigrant women and girls to promote their digital literacy and digital education,  \n\nViolence against women migrant workers \nA/RES/80/185\n \n7/15\n25-20998 \n \n \nRecognizing that the vulnerabilities documented for women migrant workers \nhighlight increasingly complex migration contexts and channels, where migrant \nworkers may find themselves in life-threatening situations when entering other \ncountries, \n \nHighlighting measures adopted by some countries of destination to alleviate the \nplight of women migrant workers residing in their areas of jurisdiction and to promote \naccess to justice, including through the establishment of gender-sensitive protection \nmechanisms for women migrant workers, by facilitating their access to mechanisms \nfor reporting complaints or providing assistance during legal proceedings and by \npromoting actions to protect migrant women who are victims of violence, \n \nUnderlining the important role of relevant United Nations treaty bodies in \nmonitoring the implementation of human rights conventions and of the relevant \nspecial procedures, as well as of the supervisory mechanisms of the International \nLabour Organization, in monitoring the implementation of international labour \nstandards, within their respective mandates, in addressing the problem of violence \nagainst women migrant workers and in protecting and promoting their human rights \nand welfare, \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General;23 \n \n2. \nTakes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on the \nreview and appraisal of the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform \nfor Action and the outcomes of the twenty-third special session of the General \nAssembly,24 which highlights, inter alia, that overall progress in the implementation \nof the Platform for Action has been particularly slow for women and girls who \nexperience multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and that marginalized \ngroups of women, including migrant women, are at particular risk of discrimination \nand violence; \n \n3. \nInvites Member States to consider ratifying relevant International Labour \nOrganization conventions, including the Migration for Employment Convention \n(Revised), 1949 (No. 97),25 the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) \nConvention, 1975 (No. 143),26 the Private Employment Agencies Convention, 1997 \n(No. 181)27 and the Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189), and to consider \nsigning and ratifying

Statelessness,31 as well as all other human rights \ntreaties that contribute to the protection of the rights of women migrant workers, calls \nupon States Parties to comply with their relevant
