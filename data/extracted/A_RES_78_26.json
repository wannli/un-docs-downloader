\n\nA/RES/78/26 \nPromotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament \nand non-proliferation\n \n23-24529\n2/3 \n \namong the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally and that, as the \nmost universal and most delegation organization in the world, the United Nations \nmust play the central role, \n \nConvinced that, in the globalization era and with the information revolution, \narms regulation, non-proliferation and disarmament problems are more than ever the \nconcern of all countries in the world, which are affected in one way or another by \nthese problems and therefore should have the possibility to participate in the \nnegotiations that arise to tackle them, \n \nBearing in mind the existence of a broad structure of disarmament and arms \nregulation agreements resulting from non-discriminatory and transparent multilateral \nnegotiations with the participation of a large number of countries, regardless of their \nsize and power, \n \nAware of the need to advance further in the field of arms regulation, \nnon-proliferation and disarmament on the basis of universal, multilateral, \nnon-discriminatory and transparent negotiations with the goal of reaching general and \ncomplete disarmament under strict international control, \n \nRecognizing the complementarity of bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral \nnegotiations on disarmament, \n \nRecognizing also that the proliferation and development of weapons of mass \ndestruction, including nuclear weapons, are among the most immediate threats to \ninternational peace and security which need to be dealt with, with the highest priority, \n \nConsidering that the multilateral disarmament agreements provide the \nmechanism for States parties to consult one another and to cooperate in solving any \nproblems which may arise in relation to the objective of, or in the application of, the \nprovisions of the agreements and that such consultations and cooperation may also be \nundertaken through appropriate international procedures within the framework of the \nUnited Nations and in accordance with the Charter, \n \nStressing that international cooperation, the peaceful settlement of disputes, \ndialogue and confidence-building measures would make an essential contribution to \nthe creation of multilateral and bilateral friendly relations among peoples and nations, \n \nBeing gravely concerned at the continuous and progressive erosion of \nmultilateralism in the field of arms regulation, non-proliferation and disarmament, \nand recognizing that the abrogation of major instruments of the arms control and \nnon-proliferation architecture as a result of unilateral actions by Member States in \nresolving their security concerns would jeopardize international peace and security \nand undermine confidence in the international security system as well as the \nfoundations of the United Nations itself, \n \nNoting that the Eighteenth Summit of Heads of State or Government of \nNon-Aligned Countries, held in Baku on 25 and 26 October 2019, welcomed the \nadoption of resolution 73/41 on the promotion of multilateralism in the area of \ndisarmament and non-proliferation and underlined the fact that multilateralism and \nmultilaterally agreed solutions, in accordance with the Charter, provide the only \nsustainable method of addressing disarmament and international security issues, 2 \n \nReaffirming the absolute validity of multilateral diplomacy in the field of \ndisarmament and non-proliferation, and determined to promote multilateralism as an \nessential way to develop arms regulation and disarmament negotiations, \n__________________ \n \n2  See A/74/548, annex. \n\nPromotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament  \nand
