implementing sustainable and inclusive \nrecovery strategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build \nresilience to future shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health \nsystems and achieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and \ntimely access for all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, \ntherapeutics and diagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, \nsolidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one \nbehind, \n \nNoting the changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the world of work, \nwhich varied greatly across geography and economic sectors, and that, despite the \nreturn to in-person activities, the technologies that reached peak prominence during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic have largely remained integrated in our work and education \nsystems, making digital literacy skills indispensable, and stressing the need for \ncontinuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances, \n \nNoting also the crucial contribution and the use of information and \ncommunications technologies, which enabled continuity in commerce and \nemployment through the pandemic and also served to demonstrate the relationships \nbetween digital, social and economic inclusion and exclusion, and in this regard \nnoting further the importance of digital literacy skills and the role of equitable, \ninclusive, affordable, quality and reliable access to digital connectivity in boosting \nemployability, enabling individuals to lift themselves out of poverty and away from \ndisadvantages, \n \nStressing that technological changes and breakthroughs are expanding at a rapid \npace and having an impact on the world of work and that, in this regard, the \ndevelopment of human resources needs to keep pace and be supported by proactive

are increasingly \naffecting all spheres of human life and resources, including and beyond education, \nwork and health, and that, if managed wisely, those developments can be an important \ninstrument in achieving progress on the 2030 Agenda and generating better \nlivelihoods for all, \n \nNoting that rapid technological change can lead to both highly skilled \nemployment opportunities as well as disruptions in labour markets, which can have \nadverse distributional effects, including rising inequality among and within countries, \n \nNoting also that technological advancements should be harnessed to improve \nconditions for human capital in support of the overarching goal of leaving no one \nbehind, and that appropriate measures should be taken in this regard, \n \nRecognizing that the lack of digital infrastructure, connectivity and skills, \nincluding lack of electricity, broadband Internet connection, availability, affordability \nand use of information and communications technologies, education, expertise and \nhuman capacity, remains a fundamental challenge in many developing countries, in \nparticular the least developed countries, which can contribute to digital divides \nincluding different levels of readiness to make use of and benefit from safe, secure \nand trustworthy artificial intelligence, stressing the need to bridge the digital divide \nwithin and between States and to leapfrog to frontier technologies, \n \nRecognizing also that the commitments in the Global Digital Compact that are \nrelevant to human resources development, particularly those related to digital literacy, \nskills and capacities, require enhancing cooperation and ensuring the provision of the \n\nA/RES/79/224 \nHuman resources development\n \n24-24324\n4/10 \n \nmeans of implementation to developing countries, tailored to their needs and \npriorities, to support their implementation including scaling up international \ncooperation and

creation, \n \nRecognizing the evidence of an uneven recovery and the adverse impacts, \nparticularly on development, of the world financial and economic challenges that \ncontinue to diminish the ability of many countries, especially developing countries, \nto cope with and address human resources development challenges and to formulate \nand implement effective strategies for poverty eradication and sustainable \ndevelopment, \n \nAcknowledging the important synergies between international migration and \ndevelopment and the need to deal with the challenges and opportunities that migration \npresents to countries of origin, transit and destination, recognizing that migration \nbrings benefits as well as challenges to the global community, recognizing also the \nrole that migrants returning to their country of origin can play through the utilization \nof their skills, and stressing that the brain drain continues to be a severe problem in \nmany developing and transitioning countries, undermining efforts in the area of \nhuman resources development, \n \nRecognizing the emergence of new types of employment, and the need to extend \nsocial protection rights and benefits that are accessible and portable to workers whose \nconditions of employment are non-standard, as appropriate and in accordance with \nnational circumstances, \n \nRecognizing also the need to align science, technological knowledge and \ninnovation systems with national development objectives, fully integrated with \nnational human resources development, labour needs and strategies for the \neradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, and supported by appropriate \ninstitutional and policy frameworks, which can lead to positive transformations in \npeople\u2019s lives, \n \nNoting that science, technological knowledge and innovation policies should \ntake into account the specific features of the economy in developing countries, \nincluding the size of the traditional sector, Indigenous knowledge, the limited access \nto skilled labour and capital, weak infrastructure and inadequate institutional \nframeworks, in order to generate solutions that address the specific challenges of \nthose countries and to foster synergies between modern science and technology, and \nIndigenous and local knowledge, \n \nReaffirming that gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls \nare of fundamental importance for achieving sustained economic growth, poverty \neradication and sustainable development, in accordance with the relevant General \nAssembly resolutions and United Nations conferences, and that investing in the \ndevelopment of women and girls has a multiplier effect, in particular on productivity, \nefficiency and sustained economic growth, in all sectors of the economy, especially \nin key areas such as agriculture, industry and services, including health, \n\nHuman resources development \nA/RES/79/224\n \n5/10\n24-24324 \n \n \nRecognizing that inclusive and equitable quality education is the key to \npromoting the development of human potential, equality and understanding among \npeoples, as well as

young people, women and girls, rural \ninhabitants and persons with disabilities, and those in vulnerable situations, \n \nStressing that climate change is a significant development challenge and that \nimproving educational and institutional capacities to tackle climate change is linked to \nhuman resources development efforts to ensure that populations can lead healthy and \nprosperous lives, including investing in teacher training, full and productive \nemployment and decent work for all and retention, and ensuring that all learners \nacquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, \n \nStressing also that Governments have the primary responsibility for defining \nand implementing appropriate policies for human resources development, and the \nneed for continued support from the international community for the national efforts \nof developing countries, \n \nReiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind, reaffirming the \nrecognition that
