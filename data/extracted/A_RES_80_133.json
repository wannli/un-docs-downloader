Notes that, according to World Bank estimates, at least 300 billion United \nStates dollars in investments are needed annually to promote sustainable food systems \nand that many developing countries, particularly low-income countries, are grappling \nwith multiple crises, including extreme weather disasters, constrained fiscal \nconditions, and escalating interest rates, making it challenging to finance emergency \nresponses while simultaneously investing in sustainable food systems, and in this \nregard calls upon Member States to promote a concerted effort to jointly mobilize \npublic and private capital, to achieve high-performing food systems on mutually \nagreed terms; \n \n24. Urges Member States, relevant United Nations organizations and other \nstakeholders to strengthen efforts to improve the development of sustainable \nagricultural technologies and their transfer and dissemination on mutually agreed \nterms to developing countries, especially the least developed countries, in particular \nat the bilateral and regional levels, and encourages international, regional and national \nefforts to strengthen capacity and foster the utilization of local know-how in \ndeveloping countries, especially that of smallholder and family farmers, in particular \nrural women and youth, in order to enhance agricultural productivity and the \nnutritional quality of agricultural products, promote sustainable practices in \npre\u2011harvest and post-harvest agricultural activities and enhance food security and \nnutrition-related programmes and policies that take into consideration the specific \nneeds of women, young children and youth, with particular attention to securing the \nprohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, strengthening progress \ntowards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals; \n \n25. Recognizes that recovery efforts from the coronavirus disease (COVID\u201119) \npandemic present an opportunity to promote sustainability and increase resilience of \nagriculture and food systems to the impact of the pandemic and future crises, \nincluding through the use of technology and innovation in all its forms, including \ndigital services that can increase access to financial services for small-scale producers \nand family farmers, that are gender-responsive, including in rural areas, to address \nmobility restrictions and bank closures, agricultural extension services, weather and \nclimate services, and online platforms that can enable producers to sell directly to \n\nAgricultural technology for sustainable development \nA/RES/80/133\n \n11/12\n25-20748 \n \nconsumers, leading to increased profits, improved supply chain efficiency, reduced \nwastage and better financial inclusion, leveraging artificial intelligence in supporting \nsustainable agriculture, which can help to improve the overall harvest quality and \naccuracy, and calls upon all relevant stakeholders to continue to develop policies, \ninvestments and partnerships that help to realize the potential of technologies to \ntransform agriculture and food systems, while tackling the persistent digital divides, \nincluding the gender digital divide, in order to build back better and achieve the \nSustainable Development Goals; \n \n26. Calls upon Member States and relevant United Nations organizations and \nother stakeholders to mainstream gender perspectives into agricultural policies and \nprojects and to focus on closing the gender gap by, inter alia, encouraging gender-\nbalanced investments and innovation in small-scale agricultural production and \ndistribution, and a gender-responsive value chain supported by integrated and \nmultisectoral policies, in order to improve women\u2019s productive capacity and incomes, \nstrengthen their resilience and achieve equitable access to all forms of financing, \nmarkets and networks, labour-saving technologies and agricultural technology \ninformation and know-how, equipment, decision-making forums and associated \nagricultural resources to ensure that agriculture, food security and nutrition-related \nprogrammes and policies take into consideration the specific needs of women and the \nbarriers that women face in accessing agricultural inputs and resources; \n \n27.

Remains concerned that agricultural innovations and technologies often \nbypass ageing farmers, and in particular ageing women farmers, as many do not \npossess the financial resources or the skills to adopt new practices, and in this regard \nstresses the need to strengthen the capacity of ageing farmers through continued \naccess to financial and infrastructure services and training for improved farming \ntechniques and technologies; \n \n29. Acknowledges that agricultural and technological innovations can be \nsupported by financial innovations and financial support, such as de-risking strategies \nand blended finance options, and that blended finance mechanisms are new \ninstitutional models that link public and private financing and patient capital with \nequity investments and promote schemes that more effectively distribute investments \nto small-scale enterprises and producers; \n \n30. Encourages Member States, civil society and public and private \ninstitutions to develop partnerships to support financial and market services, \nincluding training, capacity-building, quality infrastructure and extension and rural \nadvisory services, and calls for further efforts by all stakeholders to include \nsmallholder and family farmers, in particular rural women and youth, in planning and \nin taking decisions about making appropriate sustainable agricultural technologies \nand practices accessible and affordable to them, and strengthen the links between \ncommunity-based initiatives and financial institutions, including through the \npromotion of financing tools that foster agricultural sustainability; \n \n31.
