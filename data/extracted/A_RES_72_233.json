countries,  \n \nDeeply concerned that poverty acts as a serious impediment to the achievement \nof gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and that the \nfeminization of poverty persists, stressing the importance of giving women equal \nrights with men to economic resources, including access to ownership and control \nover land and other forms of property, credit, inheritance, natural resources and \nappropriate new technology, reaffirming that women play a critical role in \ndevelopment, contribute to structural transformation and are key contributors to the \neconomy and to combating poverty and inequalities and that their full, effective and \nequal participation in decision-making and the economy is vital in order to achieve \nsustainable development and significantly enhance economic growth and \nproductivity, recognizing that the economic and social losses due to a lack of progress \nin achieving gender equality and women\u2019s and girls\u2019 empowerment are significant \nand that it is therefore critical that our policies and actions are not just gender-\nresponsive but actively seek to advance the goal of gender equality and women\u2019s and \ngirls\u2019 empowerment, and reaffirming that gender equality and the empowerment of \nall women and girls will make a crucial contribution to progress in realizing the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development and are critical factors in the eradication of \npoverty,  \n \nRecognizing that, after the latest global financial crisis, the global economy is \nstill facing difficult macroeconomic conditions, low commodity prices, subdued trade \ngrowth and volatile capital flows, that, notwithstanding the impact of the financial \ncrisis, financial flows and developing countries\u2019 share in world trade have continued \nto increase, that these advances have contributed towards a substantial reduction in \nthe number of people living in extreme poverty, and that, despite these gains, many \ncountries, particularly developing countries, still face considerable challenges and \nsome have fallen further behind,  \n \nUnderlining that the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of \nPoverty (2008\u20132017) coincided with the 2007\u20132008 shocks in food and energy prices \nand the onset of the global financial and economic crisis that led to the great recession, \nas well as witnessed major natural disasters and an escalation of conflicts that erased \nyears of development progress in some regions, in which policy lessons from the \nresponses to these crises and disasters will be important for maintaining the \nmomentum generated by the implementation of the Decade towards poverty \neradication and ensuring that markets work better for people living in poverty,  \n \nReaffirming that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, \nthat its adverse impacts undermine the ability of all countries to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment, that increases in global temperature, sea level rise, ocean acidification \nand other climate change impacts are seriously affecting coastal areas and low-lying \ncoastal countries, including many least developed countries and small island \ndeveloping States, and that the survival of many societies and of the biological \nsupport systems of the planet is at risk, which further threatens food security and \nefforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and thus requires \nurgent action to maintain, preserve and sustain the development gains achieved in the \npast decades,  \n \nWelcoming the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017\u20132030,15 and \nrecognizing that an estimated 1.6 billion people \u2014 25 per cent of the global \npopulation

prosecute those involved in \ncorrupt activities and recover and return stolen assets to their country of origin, as \nappropriate, encouraging the international community to develop good practices on \nasset return, expressing support to the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative of the United \nNations and the World Bank and other international initiatives that support the \nrecovery of stolen assets, urging that regional conventions against corruption be \nupdated and ratified, and striving to eliminate safe havens that create incentives for \nthe transfer abroad of stolen assets and illicit financial flows,  \n \nCommitted to working to strengthen regulatory frameworks at all levels to \nfurther increase the transparency and accountability of financial institutions and the \ncorporate sector, as well as public administrations, and to strengthening international \ncooperation and national institutions to combat money-laundering and the financing \nof terrorism, \n \nReaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including \nextreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an \nindispensable requirement for sustainable development, particularly in Africa, in the \nleast developed countries, in small island developing States and in some middle-\nincome countries, and underlining the importance of accelerating sustainable, \ninclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development, including full, \nproductive employment and decent work for all, with a view to reducing inequalities \nwithin and among countries,  \n \nRecognizing the importance of supporting countries in their efforts to eradicate \npoverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, and to promote \nthe

affected by disasters and outbreaks,  \n \nRecognizing the centrality of mobilizing financial and non-financial resources \nfor development at the national and international levels and the effective use of those \nresources, as well as the importance of policy coherence and a coordinated approach \nthat involves participation at all levels by all actors to promote an enabling \nenvironment for sustainable development, and of reinvigorating the global \npartnership for sustainable development in support of the achievement of the \ninternationally agreed development goals, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment, which builds upon the unfinished business of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals,  \n \nUnderscoring that, for all countries, public policies and the mobilization

challenge \nand an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, as well as an \noverarching objective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, of which the \nAddis Ababa Action Agenda is an integral part;  \n \n6. \nAlso reaffirms that each country must take primary responsibility for its \nown economic and social development and that the role of national policies and \ndevelopment strategies for the achievement of sustainable development and poverty \neradication cannot be overemphasized, and recognizes that increased effective \nnational efforts should be complemented by concrete, effective and supportive \ninternational programmes, measures and policies aimed at expanding the \ndevelopment opportunities of developing countries, while taking into account \nnational conditions and ensuring respect for national ownership strategies and \nsovereignty;  \n \n7. \nUnderlines the importance of drawing lessons from the implementation of \nthe Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008\u20132017) and \nthe Millennium Development Goals, in particular with respect to strengthening \nnational statistical capacity and monitoring systems to ensure access to data which \nare of high quality, accessible, timely, reliable and disaggregated by income, sex, age, \nrace, ethnicity, migration status, disability and geographic location and other

coherent strategies at \nall levels, in accordance with the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences \nand summits in the economic, social and related fields, and calls upon donor countries \nin a position to do so to support the effective national efforts of developing countries \nin this regard through predictable financial resources and technical assistance on \nbilateral and multilateral bases;  \n \n10. Also calls upon the international community, including Member States, to \ncontinue their ambitious efforts to strive for more inclusive, equitable, balanced, \nstable and development-oriented sustainable socioeconomic approaches to \novercoming poverty, and, in view of the negative impact of inequality, including \ngender inequality, on poverty, emphasizes the importance of structural transformation \nthat leads to inclusive and sustainable industrialization for employment creation and \npoverty reduction, investing in sustainable agriculture and quality, reliable, \nsustainable and resilient infrastructure to support economic development and human \nwell-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all, enhancing \ninterconnectivity and achieving access to energy, and improving access to financial \nservices, as well as promoting decent rural employment, improving access to quality \neducation, promoting quality health care, including through the acceleration of the \ntransition towards equitable access to universal health coverage, advancing gender \nequality and the empowerment of all women and girls, expanding social protection \ncoverage, climate change mitigation and adaptation and combating inequality and \nsocial exclusion;  \n \n11. \nWelcomes the remarkable progress made since 1990, which has lifted \n1 billion people out of extreme poverty, and the unprecedented decrease in the \npercentage of people living on less than 1.90 United States dollars a day23 since the \nbeginning of the Second Decade;  \n \n12. Remains deeply concerned that, while the prevalence of extreme poverty \ncontinues its decades-long descent, progress has been uneven, 1.6 billion people still \nlive in multidimensional poverty, the total number of persons living in extreme \npoverty remains unacceptably high and the non-income dimensions of poverty and \ndeprivation, such as access to quality education or basic health services, and relative \npoverty remain major concerns;  \n \n13. Recognizes the urgent need to address poverty in all its forms and \ndimensions, including extreme poverty, hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, \nwhich will lead to rich payoffs across the Sustainable Development Goals, and \nencourages the international community to enhance international cooperation and to \ndevote resources to developing rural and urban areas and sustainable agriculture and \nfisheries and to supporting smallholder farmers, especially women farmers, herders \nand fishers in developing countries, particularly in the least developed countries;  \n \n14. Stresses the resolve to eradicate extreme poverty for all people \neverywhere, measured since mid-2015 as living on less than 1.90 dollars a day, and \nthe efforts to reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all \nages living in poverty in all its forms and dimensions, according to national \ndefinitions;  \n \n15.

Emphasizes the importance of an outcome from the Second Decade, and \nthat, while the centrality of employment and decent jobs to the eradication of poverty \nis well recognized, employment growth has not been sufficient to absorb the growing \nlabour force, especially in those countries and regions with large youth populations;  \n \n17. Notes with concern the continuing high levels of unemployment and \nunderemployment, inter alia, among young people, including young women in \nparticular, recognizes that decent work for all remains one of the best routes out of \npoverty, and in this regard invites donor countries, multilateral organizations and \nother development partners to continue to assist Member States, in particular \ndeveloping countries, in adopting policies consistent with the Global Jobs Pact \nadopted by the International Labour Conference at its ninety-eighth session as a \ngeneral framework within which each country can formulate policy packages specific \nto its situation and national priorities in order to promote a job-intensive recovery and \nsustainable development;  \n \n18.
