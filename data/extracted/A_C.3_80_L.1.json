Background information on those items may \nbe found in the annotations to the agenda (see A/80/100 and A/80/100/Add.1). \n \n \n \nProgramme of work \n \n2. \nThe draft programme of work (see annex) has been prepared bearing in mind \nparagraph (b) of rule 99 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, Assembly \ndecision 79/540 on the programme of work of the Third Committee for the eightieth \nsession, the provisional agenda of the eightieth session (A/80/150) and relevant \nresolutions and decisions adopted by the Assembly on the rationalization of its work \nand that of the Committee, as well as past experience in the utilization of conference \nservices. The modalities on the arrangements for the work of the Third Committee at \nthe eightieth session have been revised pursuant to the proposal submitted by the \nBureau, taking into account the continued limitations arising from the liquidity crisis. \nThese arrangements are exceptional and will not constitute a precedent for the \nprogramme of work of the eighty-first or any future session, irrespective of meeting \nentitlements or liquidity constraints. The Bureau remains committed to exploring all \noptions thoroughly and to restore the traditional format of general discussions on \nindividual items or clusters, alongside interactive dialogues, in its recommendation \nfor the programme of work of the eighty-first session. \n \n \n \nQuestion time and interactive dialogues \n \n3. \nIn accordance with the established practice of the Committee and pursuant to \nparagraphs 3 (c) and (d) of the annex to General Assembly resolution 58/316 on \nfurther measures for the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly, \nimmediately following the introduction of reports, interactive dialogues or a \n\u201cquestion time\u201d will be held with heads of departments and offices, representatives \nof the Secretary-General, special rapporteurs and other special mechanisms as part of \nthe formal proceedings of the Committee. Delegations are invited to participate \nactively in the dialogues with questions and unscripted comments, which are limited \n\nA/C.3/80/L.1 \n \n25-14215\n2/10 \n \nto two to three minutes or less for single dialogues and six to nine minutes or less for \ncombined dialogues.  \n \n \n \nGeneral debate \n \n4. \nAlso pursuant to the proposal submitted by the Bureau, on an exceptional basis, \nthe general discussion of each agenda item or cluster of agenda items will be replaced \nby a single general debate to be held prior to the start of the interactive dialogues. \nThis arrangement will not establish a precedent for future sessions. \n \n \n \nStatements by delegations \n \n5. \nThe list of speakers for the general debate on any or all agenda items allocated \nto the Committee will be opened on Tuesday, 16 September 2025. \n6. \nStatements made during the general debate under any or all agenda items will \nbe limited to 10 minutes for individual delegations and to 12 minutes for statements \nmade on behalf of a group of delegations. A digital timer will be projected on the \nscreen so that speakers can keep track of their speaking time, with microphones \nswitched off automatically after the allotted time. Pursuant to General Assembly \nresolution 72/313, delegations are encouraged to adhere to the \u201call protocol observed\u201d \nprinciple and to refrain from listing standard protocol expressions during their \nstatements. In the same resolution, the Assembly recommended that speakers should \nbe mindful of the speed of statement delivery, bearing in mind the need for accuracy \nof interpretation. As per past practice, the Committee will maintain a \u201crolling\u201d list of \nspeakers for the general debate, which means that delegations should be ready to \ndeliver their statements earlier, if necessary. \n7. \nIn accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, delegations should \nexercise their right of reply at the end of the day whenever two meetings have been \nscheduled for the consideration of the relevant agenda item on that day, or at the \nconclusion of the consideration of the item, if that is sooner. The first statement should \nbe limited to five minutes and the second, if any, to three minutes. Also in accordance \nwith previous decisions of the General Assembly and the practice of the Committee, \nexplanations of vote and points of order should be limited to three minutes. \n \n \n \nList of documents \n \n8. \nAttention is drawn to the addendum to the present note (to be issued as \nA/C.3/80/L.1/Add.1), which will contain a list of the documentation submitted under \neach agenda item expected to be allocated to the Committee. The list of documents, \nwith any updates, will be available on iGov.  \n \n \n \nConference facilities and meeting arrangements \n \n9. \nUnless otherwise specified, formal meetings of the Committee will be held from \n10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 to 6 p.m. in Conference Room 1 (Conference Building). \nThe General Assembly has stressed that a punctual start of meetings is critical to the \nefficient utilization of services allocated to the intergovernmental bodies of the United \nNations. In accordance with past practice, it is proposed that rule 108 of the rules of \nprocedure of the Assembly be waived with respect to the quorum needed to declare a \nmeeting open. \n \n \n \nDeadlines and sponsorship of draft resolutions and proposals \n \n10. Sponsors are responsible for ensuring accurate and timely submission of their \nproposal, in accordance with the submission guidelines and prior to the Committee-\n\nA/C.3/80/L.1\n \n3/10\n25-14215 \n \napproved deadline. Adherence to the deadlines is critical to ensuring the successful \nconclusion of the work of the Committee.  \n11. \nThe initiation and sponsorship of draft proposals will be undertaken \nelectronically through the eSponsorship application without prejudice to the \npossibility offered to delegations of co-sponsoring a proposal at the time of the \nCommittee\u2019s action on the latter. To maximize the efficiency of the Committee, \nhowever, all delegations wishing to co-sponsor a proposal are encouraged to do so \nelectronically through the eSponsorship application rather than during the formal \nproceedings of the Committee. \n \n \n \nIntroduction of draft resolutions \n \n12. In line with efforts to further enhance the efficiency of the Committee, main \nsponsors of proposals are urged to limit the introduction of their proposals, which \nmay be made solely at the time of their consideration by the Committee, to statements \nnot exceeding three minutes. Main sponsors are requested not to make a formal \nintroductory statement on a draft resolution upon its issuance as an \u201cL\u201d document. \n \n \n \nReport of the Economic and Social Council \n \n13. In paragraph 4 (c) of the annex to General Assembly resolution 58/316, the \nAssembly decided that the item entitled \u201cReport of the Economic and Social Council\u201d \nshould be considered in its entirety in plenary meeting. Subsequently, it was clarified \nthat, in implementing that decision, the relevant parts of chapter I of the report of the \nCouncil that related to agenda items allocated to the Main Committees would be \nconsidered by the Committee concerned, for final action by the Assembly (see \nA/59/250/Add.1, para. 4). \n \n \n \nReport of the Human Rights Council \n \n14. In its resolution 65/281, entitled \u201cReview of the Human Rights Council\u201d, the \nGeneral Assembly decided to continue its practice of allocating the item entitled \n\u201cReport of the Human Rights Council\u201d to the plenary of the Assembly and to the \nThird Committee, in accordance with its decision 65/503 A, with the understanding \nthat the President of the Council will present the report in her or his capacity as \nPresident to the plenary of the Assembly and to the Committee and that the Committee \nwill hold an interactive dialogue with the President of the Council following the \npresentation of the report of the Council to the Committee. \n \n \n \nConclusion of the work of the Committee \n \n15. Bearing in mind the number of meetings allocated to the Committee, a target \ndate of 21 November 2025 has been set for the conclusion of its work. The Committee \nwill, however, endeavour to conclude its work earlier, if possible. \n \n \n\nA/C.3/80/L.1 \n \n25-14215\n4/10 \n \nAnnex \n \n \n Draft programme of work of the Third Committee \n \n
