resolutions related to the eradication of poverty,  \n \nReaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including \nextreme poverty, which is disproportionately high in rural areas, is the greatest global \nchallenge facing the world today and is an indispensable requirement for sustainable \ndevelopment, particularly in Africa, in the least developed countries, in landlocked \ndeveloping countries, in small island developing States and in some middle-income \ncountries, noting with concern that, as of 2024, approximately 839 million people still \nlive in extreme poverty compounded by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic, the precarious recovery and the continued global crisis of food, finance \nand challenge of energy access, and underlining the importance of accelerating \nsustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, recovery and sustainable \ndevelopment, including full, productive employment and decent work for all, with a \nview to reducing inequalities within and among countries,  \n \nNoting that the share of the rural poor in the total population of those living in \npoverty has remained disproportionately high, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and \nSouth Asia, which highlights the setbacks and challenges in fighting rural poverty and \nthe need for accelerated action towards the eradication of poverty, and recognizing \n__________________ \n \n1  Adopted under the UNFCCC in FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21. \n \n2  United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1771, No. 30822. \n \n3  Resolution 71/256, annex. \n\nA/C.2/80/L.32\n \n3/9\n25-16860 \n \nthat addressing rural poverty is fundamental for the achievement of Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 1 of the 2030 Agenda, as well as most of the other Goals, with 70 \nper cent of the targets requiring action in rural areas,  \n \nEmphasizing that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on sustainable \ndevelopment and disruption of the normal functioning of open markets, global supply \nchain connectivity and the flow of essential goods have increased the number of \npeople living in poverty around the world, hindered the fight against poverty and \nadded urgency to the call to galvanize action and delivery for the eradication of \npoverty, in all its forms and dimensions, particularly in rural areas, where most of the \nextreme poor live, and in this regard welcoming the Sustainable Development Goals \nMoments, held since 2020, placing an emphasis on poverty and inequality, on climate \nchange and a healthy planet and on achieving gender equality and the empowerment \nof all women and girls,  \n \nEmphasizing also that the rural poor might be less prepared to deal with the \neffects of and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple crises and could \nhave less access to adequate sanitation, food and nutrition, water, healthcare services, \neducation, the Internet, information and communications technology, social \nprotection, financial services and public infrastructure, taking note of the efforts of \nthe President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session to launch the \nAlliance for Poverty Eradication, which is timely and meaningful and continues to \nserve as a platform for the exchange of ideas, policies and best practices on poverty \neradication, and stressing the importance of addressing poverty, including rural \npoverty issues, \n \nCommending the efforts and remarkable progress achieved by developing \ncountries in eradicating rural poverty, while noting with concern that key gaps still \nremain, such as: a lack of adequate data; inadequate investment in agricultural and \nrural development; lower and inadequate human capital formation relevant for rural \nlivelihoods; inadequate income sources, including limited access to productive \nresources and scarce non-farm income-generating opportunities; a lack of productive \ncapacity and agricultural transformation; persistent gender inequality; insufficient \nbasic infrastructure, such as roads, water and electricity, basic health, Internet and \ndigital technologies, education and social protection services; the lack of public \npolicies that support those efforts, as well as the lack of or poor adaptive capacity and \nresilience to cope with the adverse effects of climate change and disasters, especially \nweather-related hazards including the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon; and a lack of effective \nrural institutions and of sufficient resources,  \n \nRecognizing the leading role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations, together with other United Nations entities, including the \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development, the International Labour \nOrganization and the United Nations Development Programme, in the global efforts \nto reduce poverty, including rural poverty, while addressing other interlinked \nchallenges such as eliminating hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, \nand increasing the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises,  \n \nNoting with appreciation the aspirations, embedded in Agenda 2063 of the \nAfrican Union, to lift huge sections of the population out of poverty, improve incomes \nand catalyse economic and social transformation, and recognizing the importance of \nthe international community\u2019s involvement and cooperation with African countries to \nachieve such goals, especially in the rural areas of the African continent,  \n \nNoting that, while considerable progress has been made over the past decade \nacross all areas of development, the pace of progress observed in recent years is \ninsufficient and uneven to fully meet the Sustainable Development Goals and targets \n\nA/C.2/80/L.32 \n \n25-16860\n4/9 \n \nby 2030, especially in the area of rural poverty eradication, and that it is projected \nthat there will still be over 620 million people living in extreme poverty in 2030,  \n \nRecognizing that poverty is a serious impediment to the achievement of gender \nequality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including those living in rural \nareas, and that the feminization of poverty persists, emphasizing that the eradication \nof poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is an \nindispensable requirement for sustainable development, expressing its concern that \nrural women and girls fare far worse on most development indicators, acknowledging \nthe mutually reinforcing links between the achievement of gender equality and the \nempowerment of all women and girls and the eradication of poverty, and stressing the \nimportance of support for countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms \nand dimensions,  \n \nNoting that, without targeted interventions tackling the structural causes of rural \npoverty, the objectives of the 2030 Agenda will remain unattainable,  \n \nEmphasizing that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda depends crucially on \nthe transformation of rural areas, where most of the poor and hungry live, and that, in \norder to eradicate rural poverty, investment should be encouraged in those sectors that \nhave a bigger impact, such as education, health, agriculture and employment, \nincluding school feeding programmes, social protection and infrastructure, while \nnoting the financing gap between resources dedicated to the education sector and the \namount necessary to reach Sustainable Development Goal 4, and that several trillion \nUnited States dollars in substantial investments could be needed to end hunger and \nsome forms of malnutrition and to increase the affordability of healthy diets, and that \nthe investments that are needed for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and loss \nand damage also remain underfunded,  \n \nNoting with great concern that extreme weather events, and slow-onset \nprocesses, such as increasing temperature, desertification and loss of biodiversity, \ndisproportionately affect the poor and people in vulnerable situations, many of whom \nreside in rural areas in low- and middle-income countries and depend on agriculture \nand natural resources for their livelihoods,  \n \nRecalling the proclamation of 2019\u20132028 as the United Nations Decade of \nFamily Farming, to raise the profile of the role of family farming 4 in contributing to \nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and reaffirming the importance of the United \nNations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016\u20132025), which was extended to 2030, in \nthe promotion of activities towards the eradication of rural poverty, \n \nRecognizing the interlinkages and integrated nature of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, and reiterating that the eradication of rural poverty and hunger \nis crucial for the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including \nthose contained in the 2030 Agenda, and that rural development should be pursued \nthrough an integrated approach that encompasses economic, social and environmental \ndimensions, takes into account a gender perspective and consists of mutually \nreinforcing policies and programmes, and that should be balanced, targeted, situation-\nspecific and locally owned, include local synergies and initiatives and be responsive \nto the needs of rural populations,  \n \nRecalling that more than three quarters of the extreme poor lived in rural areas \nin 2022 and worked in agriculture and that the extreme poverty rate in rural areas is \nthree times higher than in urban areas, and recognizing that devoting resources to the \ndevelopment of rural areas and sustainable agriculture and supporting smallholder \n__________________ \n \n4  Resolution 72/239. \n\nA/C.2/80/L.32\n \n5/9\n25-16860 \n \nfarmers, especially women farmers, is key to ending poverty in all its forms and \ndimensions, by, inter alia, improving the welfare of farmers,  \n \nTaking into consideration the increasing number of young people who decide to \nleave rural areas for more urbanized ones and the challenges that this trend poses to \nthe livelihood of rural families,  \n \nEmphasizing the importance of enhancing global support for national work on \nrural development policies and strategies, including on commodity production as well \nas increased public and private investments to upgrade productive capacity, and that \ntackling rural poverty requires integrated, cross-sectoral, multi-stakeholder and \ncontext-specific interventions, with a strong emphasis on sustainable food and \nagricultural systems for food security, and nutrition, economic growth, revitalization \nand development, and social protection in rural areas,  \n \n1. \nTakes \nnote \nof \nthe \nreport \nof \nthe \nSecretary-General 5  and \nthe \nrecommendations contained therein;  \n \n2. \nReaffirms that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including \nextreme poverty, for all people everywhere, is the greatest global challenge and an \nindispensable requirement for sustainable development, as well as an overarching \nobjective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 6 of which the Addis \nAbaba Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment7 is an integral part, supporting and complementing it;  \n \n3. \nExpresses its deep concern that the progress in reducing poverty remains \nuneven, with 1.1 billion people still living in multidimensional poverty, 84 per cent \nof whom live in rural areas, and that this number continues to be significant and \nunacceptably high, whereas the levels of inequality in income, wealth and \nopportunities remain high or are increasing in a number of countries, and the \nnon-income dimensions of poverty and deprivation, such as access to inclusive and \nequitable quality education or basic health services, and relative poverty remain major \nconcerns, and stresses the importance of national and global efforts to create the \nconditions for achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions, economic, \nsocial and environmental, sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, \nshared prosperity and decent work for all in society, taking into account different \nlevels of national development capacities;  \n \n4. \nRecognizes the importance of promoting socioeconomic development in \nrural areas as an effective strategy and important means at the global level for the \neradication of poverty, including extreme poverty, and therefore underlines the \nimportance of shaping a rural poverty eradication pattern with the concerted efforts \nof the whole of society to promote socioeconomic development in rural areas and \ncreate sound policy frameworks at the local, national, regional and international levels \nbased on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies to support accelerated \ninvestment in poverty eradication action;  \n \n5. \nEmphasizes that economic growth continues to leave rural dwellers \nbehind, that rural areas host a disproportionate share of people living in \nmultidimensional poverty, and recommends that countries promote dedicated and \ncoordinated social, economic, agricultural and rural development in their national \npolicies, including by adopting rural-focused poverty eradication strategies in \nalignment with the 2030 Agenda, social policies aimed at improving human capital in \nrural areas and ensuring access to adequate social protection coverage, agricultural \n__________________ \n \n5  A/80/282. \n \n6  Resolution 70/1. \n \n7  Resolution 69/313, annex. \n\nA/C.2/80/L.32 \n \n25-16860\n6/9 \n \npolicies aimed at boosting agricultural productivity, and rural development policies \naimed at improving access to rural infrastructure and basic services of high quality \nand at boosting non-farm employment opportunities;  \n \n6. \nRecognizes the critical role and contribution of rural women, including \nsmallholders and women farmers, fishers, Indigenous women and their traditional \nknowledge and women in local communities, in enhancing agricultural and rural \ndevelopment, improving food security and nutrition and eradicating rural poverty, and \ntherefore highlights the importance of promoting their economic empowerment, their \nfull access to land ownership and decent work and economic opportunities and their \nparticipation in decision-making;  \n \n7. \nStresses the importance of establishing and implementing targeted policies \nand measures to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme \npoverty, by formulating rural development strategies with clear poverty eradication \ngoals, strengthening national statistical capacity and monitoring systems, including \ninnovative use of telephone surveys and high-resolution data facilitated by remote \nsensing, and implementing nationally appropriate social protection systems and \nmeasures for all, and taking concrete actions to prevent the return to poverty, \nespecially when recent years have witnessed a sharp setback in poverty reduction, \nwith a view to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions, economic, \nsocial and environmental, and building the resilience of the poor and those in \nvulnerable situations, and encourages experience-sharing and international \ncooperation among different countries in these regards; \n \n8. \nEncourages all countries and other relevant stakeholders to promote \ninclusive economic transformation in rural areas that increases productivity and \ncontributes to bridging the present rural-urban divide while ensuring productive \nemployment and decent work; access to reliable and appropriate social protection \nsystems, inclusive and equitable quality education and skills training, healthcare \nservices, quality, resilient and sustainable infrastructure, roads and telecommunications, \nand financial inclusion and support; preparedness planning for crises and early \nwarning; cooperation on digital, information and communications technology, \nscience, technology and innovation, especially in the area of e-commerce, financial \ntechnology (fintech); affordable and reliable Internet connectivity and digital \ninfrastructure investment and construction; and functioning of food and agriculture \nsupply chains, to achieve momentum under the 2030 Agenda for an inclusive, \nsustainable and resilient recovery for global development, putting people at the centre \nof the response, protecting our planet and achieving prosperity, with no one left \nbehind, in line with the 2030 Agenda;  \n \n9. \nRecognizes that eradicating poverty in rural areas cannot be separated from \nthe sustainable transformation and strengthening of food systems, improving \nagricultural productivity, strengthening the resilience of micro-, small and medium-\nsized enterprises in the agrifood sector, building sustainable linkages between micro- , \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, larger-scale business partners and support \ninstitutions to help micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises to increase their \ncompetitiveness through economies of scale, use of shared services such as industrial \nparks, and access to training, expertise and knowledge, and that ensuring fair markets \nthat enable the participation of smallholder and family farmers in food systems, \nparticularly in value chains where small-scale producers have a comparative \nadvantage, will continue to be important, and in this regard takes note with \nappreciation of the United Nations Food Systems Summit, held in 2021, which \nrecognized the transformative effects of sustainable food systems as a driver for the \nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030; \n\nA/C.2/80/L.32\n \n7/9\n25-16860 \n \n \n10. Underscores that promoting a universal, rules-based, open, transparent, \npredictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system \nunder the World Trade Organization is essential for building sustainable, inclusive \nand resilient food systems, and thus stresses the importance of keeping trade channels \nand markets open, equitable, transparent, non-discriminatory and predictable for the \nmovement of food, fertilizer and other agricultural inputs and outputs and access to \nenergy, and emphasizes the urgent need to combat protectionism in all its forms and \nto correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions that are inconsistent with \nWorld Trade Organization rules in world agricultural markets;  \n \n11. \nNotes with great concern that the poorest population spends a larger share \nof income on food, which means extreme food price volatility can have devastating \nimpacts, and is a driver of increased poverty, particularly in rural areas;  \n \n12. Calls upon all countries to promote agricultural and rural development in \ntheir national policies and renew their efforts to promote innovative approaches, \nincluding agroecology, among other approaches, to enhance capacity for food \nproduction, distribution and storage, cooperate in the relevant areas of science, \nresearch, technology and innovation, as appropriate and consistent with national \npolicies and frameworks, to strengthen sustainable agrifood systems that enhance \nfood security and nutrition, including sustainable productivity growth, significantly \nreducing food loss and waste, and strengthen policies that support small-scale \nproducers in engaging in agrifood system value chains;  \n \n13. Recognizes the importance of employment and education for pro-poor \ngrowth in rural areas and the collaboration among government agencies, the private \nsector, civil society and other actors to design and implement national skills \ndevelopment strategies responsive to local labour market needs, and encourages the \nUnited Nations system and development partners to assist countries, upon their \nrequest, in mainstreaming employment into investment policy and poverty reduction \nstrategies, including those focused on rural area development, and fostering rapid \nagricultural productivity growth, especially in developing countries, by increasing \ninvestment in agricultural and related rural off-farm activities and strengthening \ncapacity-building for agricultural producers; \n \n14. Also recognizes the essential role of inclusive and sustainable industrial \ndevelopment, which can diversify income opportunities as part of a comprehensive \nstrategy of structural economic transformation in eradicating poverty in all its forms \nand dimensions, especially in rural areas, supporting inclusive, sustained and \nsustainable economic growth, and thus in contributing to achieving sustainable \ndevelopment in developing countries, and calls upon international industrial \ncooperation to advance inclusive and sustainable industrialization and innovation and \nhelp developing countries to improve industrial production capacity;  \n \n15. Further recognizes the importance of exploring the potential of other new \neconomic activities in rural areas, which could involve tertiary industry or span \ndifferent industries, by leveraging rich natural resources, featured production \ntechniques and unique traditional cultures, and encourages the transformation of local \nadvantages to featured industries to create more decent jobs and foster sustained \nproductivity of and long-lasting development in rural areas; \n \n16. Recognizes the need to design, implement and pursue gender-responsive \neconomic and social policies aimed at, inter alia, eradicating poverty, including in \nrural areas, and combating the feminization of poverty, ensuring the full and equal \nparticipation of rural women in the development, implementation and follow-up of \ndevelopment policies and programmes and poverty eradication strategies, supporting \nincreased rural employment and decent work and the redistribution of unpaid \n\nA/C.2/80/L.32 \n \n25-16860\n8/9 \n \ndomestic and care work as well as care systems, and promoting the full, equal and \nmeaningful participation and leadership of women at all levels and sectors of the rural \neconomy and in diverse on-farm and off-farm economic activities, including \nsustainable agricultural and fisheries production;  \n \n17. Encourages Member States, international organizations, the private sector \nand other partners to develop programmes to foster the creation of decent work in \nrural areas and increase the investment in agricultural and related off-farm activities, \nespecially for young people, including through economic diversification and effective \nemployment matching mechanisms in rural areas, development of value chain across \nall stages, the promotion of sustainable agrifood systems and a balanced territorial \napproach, along a continuum that includes intermediate settlements and cities nested \namid agricultural zones, with varying levels of agglomeration, as a key to reducing \nrural poverty and persistent inequalities between urban, peri-urban and rural areas; \n \n18. Emphasizes that, globally, 1.4 billion people, primarily in rural areas in \ndeveloping countries, do not have access to formal financial products and services, \nand encourages further efforts of the international community to offer affordable ways \nto access finance, including through financial education and training on the effective \nuse of financial instruments, for the financially excluded in rural areas;  \n \n19. Also emphasizes the need to increase investment, including through \nenhanced international cooperation, in quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient rural \ninfrastructure, especially in roads, water, sanitation, electricity and Internet \nconnectivity, and to provide an inclusive and sustainable digital transformation;  \n \n20. Expresses its commitment to raising public awareness to promote the \neradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, in \nall countries, to mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of all stakeholders, \nespecially the rural residents living in extreme poverty, to fight against poverty, to \npromoting their active participation in the design and implementation of programmes \nand policies that affect them, and to providing quality education for the rural poor, \nwith the aim of achieving the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals;  \n \n21. Reiterates the need for enhanced and expanded access by developing \ncountries to appropriate technologies that are pro-poor and raise productivity, and \nunderlines the need for measures to increase investment in agriculture, including \nmodern technologies, as well as in natural resources management and capacity-\nbuilding of developing countries;  \n \n22. Stresses that the achievement of sustainable development and the \neradication of poverty also hinge on the ability and readiness of countries to \neffectively mobilize domestic resources, attract foreign direct investment, fulfil \nofficial development assistance commitments and use official development assistance \neffectively, and facilitate the transfer of technology to developing countries, and \nfurther stresses that the resolution of unsustainable debt situations is critical for \nheavily indebted poor countries, while remittances have become a significant source \nof income and finance for receiving economies and their contribution to the \nachievement of sustainable development;  \n \n23. Recognizes the importance of addressing the diverse needs of and \nchallenges faced by countries in special situations, in particular African countries, the \nleast developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island \ndeveloping States, as well as the specific challenges facing many middle-income \ncountries, and therefore requests the United Nations development system, the \ninternational financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders to \nensure that these diverse and specific development needs are appropriately considered \nand addressed, in a tailored fashion, in their relevant strategies and policies, with a \n\nA/C.2/80/L.32\n \n9/9\n25-16860 \n \nview to promoting a coherent and comprehensive approach towards individual \ncountries;  \n \n24. Realizes that bridging the digital divides will require strong commitment \nby all relevant stakeholders at the national and international levels, reiterates the \nimportance of investing in infrastructure for greater access to affordable technological \ndevices and services for rural populations, which includes leveraging technology-\nenabled financial services and financial technologies to promote financial inclusion, \nand encourages efforts by all relevant stakeholders, especially United Nations \nagencies, funds and programmes, in the spirit of win-win cooperation, to assist \ndeveloping countries in overcoming the digital divides and promoting the use of \ninformation and communications technologies to foster economic and social \ndevelopment, particularly in rural areas, with the aim of building a shared future for \nhumankind;  \n \n25. Calls for measures by relevant United Nations bodies, in accordance with \ntheir respective mandates, and other stakeholders to make good use of their \nexperience and advantages to further help developing countries with the aim of \nimproving rural development planning, including poverty eradication and \nmultisectoral development activities covering economic and social aspects, including \na gender perspective;  \n \n26. Reiterates the urgent need to accelerate the pace of rural poverty \neradication, and requests the Secretary-General, in close collaboration with the \nsecretariat of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, as well as \nother relevant international organizations, to submit to the General Assembly at its \neighty-first session a report on the status of the implementation of and follow-up to \nthe present resolution in order to identify the progress achieved, gaps and challenges \nfaced in rural poverty eradication, especially in developing countries, and to list rural \npoverty eradication as a priority for an annual Sustainable Development Goals \nMoment to highlight inspiring action on the Goals, in the context of the general debate \nof the Assembly;  \n \n27.
