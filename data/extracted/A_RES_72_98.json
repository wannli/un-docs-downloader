\nUnited Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of the Territories, \n \nWelcoming the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme \u201cImplementation of the \nThird International Decade

up-to-date \ninformation regarding the decolonization process, \n \nConscious of the different viewpoints of the political parties on the future status \nof the Territory, and noting the results of
