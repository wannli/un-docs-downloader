This was further promulgated in \nthe first decennial United Nations conference on small island developing States in \nBarbados in 1994 and was subsequently reiterated at the second conference in \nMauritius in 2005 and the third conference in Samoa in 2014. \n2. \nAfter three decades and three programmes of action, small island developing \nStates remain a special case for sustainable development, given their unique \nvulnerabilities. We note the remarkable successes and progress that they have made \nover the years, and welcome in this regard the ownership, leadership and considerable \nefforts that have been demonstrated by small island developing States, along with the \nsupport provided by the international community. \n3. \nDuring this period, small island developing States have and continue to provide \nstable and democratic governance for their citizenry and have strived to provide \nproductive economies and safe societies throughout unrelenting turbulent global \ntimes. Small island developing States were heavily affected by two \u201conce-in-a-\ngeneration\u201d crises that struck in 2008 and 2020, while grappling with even more \nintense and frequent disasters and natural hazards. In addition, they have assumed \nleadership roles in areas such as finance, climate change and plastics, and are stewards \nof the ocean, including managing 19.1 per cent of the world\u2019s exclusive economic \nzones and the resources they hold. Small island developing States have paved the way \nfor many of the most progressive movements in these areas in policy development \nand the establishment of concrete actions in the multilateral arena.  \n4. \nWe remain concerned that small island developing States are facing the \nunrelenting and compounding impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, \ndisasters and natural hazards, health and other social-related challenges and economic \nvulnerabilities, as well as the progressive deterioration in their ability to withstand \nexternal shocks and enhance their resilience. Successive global crises, along with the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, have further exacerbated and negatively \ncompounded the sustainable development of small island developing States. \n5. \nSmall island developing States are inherently and uniquely vulnerable to \nexogenous shocks owing to, inter alia, their small size, geographical remoteness, \nhighly dispersed populations, the limited scale and undiversified nature of their \neconomies, high dependence on external markets, and extreme exposure to disasters \nand natural hazards and the effects of climate change. Recognizing vulnerability does \nnot mean that small island developing States exhibit weakness or lack potential for \ndevelopment. Rather, it means recognizing that they are disproportionately impacted \nin terms of physical destruction and non-economic and economic losses to a far \ngreater scale than elsewhere. \n6. \nSmall island developing States are particularly vulnerable to adverse impacts of \nclimate change, including, inter alia, erratic precipitation, increasingly frequent and \nextreme weather phenomena, more frequent and severe tropical cyclones, floods and \ndrought, diminishing freshwater resources, desertification, coastal erosion, land \ndegradation and sea level rise, which represent the gravest of threats to the survival \nand viability of their people, natural ecosystems and overall sustainable development. \n\nThe Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing \nStates: A Renewed Declaration for Resilient Prosperity \nA/RES/78/317\n \n3/21\n24-13495 \n \nWe take note of the concerns expressed by small island developing States that the \nimpacts of climate change could have possible implications on small island \ndeveloping States, including humanitarian, economic, social, cultural, ecological and, \nas exacerbated by other factors, security consequences.  \n7. \nIn order for small island developing States to achieve sustainable development \nand resilient prosperity, we must assist small island developing States to diversify \ntheir economies and strengthen State and productive capacities. At the same time, the \ninternational financial architecture should go further to fully address the unique \ndevelopment circumstances of small island developing States and make accessing \nconcessional finance easier for them, which could mitigate their fiscal constraints and \nreduce the risk of indebtedness, especially for highly indebted small island \ndeveloping States, and prevent the reversal of hard-earned development gains. \nTherefore, the special case of small island developing States must continue to be \nrecognized by the international community and must take into account these new and \nemerging challenges.  \n8. \nWe recognize small island developing States\u2019 need for access to affordable, \nreliable, sustainable and modern energy, particularly renewable energy. Small island \ndeveloping States are facing significant barriers related to accessing finance, cost of \ncapital, market readiness and upskilling and reskilling workforces needed for just, \ninclusive and resilient energy transitions.  \n9. \nWe reaffirm the importance of freedom, peace and security, respect for all \nhuman rights, including the right to development and the right to an adequate standard \nof living, including the right to food, the rule of law, gender equality, women\u2019s \nempowerment, reducing inequalities and the overall commitment to just and \ndemocratic societies for development.  \n10. We recognize that gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment and the full \nrealization of human rights for women and girls have a transformative and multiplier \neffect on sustainable development and are a driver of economic growth in small island \ndeveloping States. Women can be powerful agents of change.  \n11. \nSmall island developing States aspire to a resilient form of prosperity that is \nreflected in sustainable development for all in their countries, where economic growth \nand well-being are sustained and their economies are robust, diversified, adaptable \nand able to withstand shocks, ensuring social equity and promoting environmental \nsustainability.  \n12. The next 10 years are critical for small island developing States. A new context \nis emerging wherein the economic, social and environmental as well as geopolitical \nthreats to the development of small island developing States are so great that they can \nonly be ameliorated by a reinvigorated enabling environment that gives meaningful \neffect to their sustainable development. Without the full support of the international \ncommunity, small island developing States will endure potentially far-reaching \nconsequences.  \n13. We reaffirm the continued applicability of the Programme of Action for the \nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (Barbados Programme \nof Action)1 adopted in 1994, the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation \nof the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island \n__________________ \n \n1  Report of the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates, Bridgetown, Barbados, 25 April\u20136 May 1994 (United Nations publication, Sales \nNo. E.94.I.18 and corrigenda), chap. I, resolution 1, annex II. \n\nA/RES/78/317 \nThe Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing \nStates: A Renewed Declaration for Resilient Prosperity\n \n24-13495\n4/21 \n \nDeveloping States (Mauritius Strategy)2 of 2005 and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities \nof Action (SAMOA) Pathway 3  of 2014 as blueprints setting out the sustainable \ndevelopment priorities of small island developing States.  \n14. We recommit to the full and timely implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development,4 the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International \nConference on Financing for Development 5  and the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change 6 and the Paris Agreement, 7 as well as the Sendai \nFramework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030,8 the New Urban Agenda,9 the \nKunming-Montreal \nGlobal \nBiodiversity \nFramework \nand \nother \nrelevant \nintergovernmentally agreed development outcomes, frameworks and instruments.  \n15. We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and \nDevelopment, 10  including, inter alia, the principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities, as set out in principle 7 thereof.  \n16. We, the Heads of State and Government and high-level representatives, having \nmet in St. John\u2019s from 27 to 30 May 2024, at the fourth International Conference on \nSmall Island Developing States, with the participation of civil society, the private \nsector, youth, academia and other relevant stakeholders, firmly reaffirm our \ncommitment to support small island developing States on their pathway to achieving \nsustainable development and resilient prosperity, where the progress of today does \nnot compromise the possibilities of tomorrow. Through targeted, results-focused \ninterventions and investments, we will support small island developing States as they \nexercise full ownership of their new agenda and seek to establish partnerships as \nequals, upholding values of equity, national ownership, mutual trust, transparency and \naccountability, and cooperation and promoting benefits across priority areas in their \nnew 10-year agenda.  \n \n \n \nII. \nWhat do small island developing States want? \n \n \n \nA. \nBuild resilient economies \n \n17. Enhancing inter-island connectivity and linking economies of small island \ndeveloping States to regional markets and global supply chains, including by \nintegrating them into existing and emerging maritime and multimodal transport and \neconomic corridors, and encouraging sustainable transport initiatives to support small \nisland developing States remains key.  \n18. We underscore that small island developing States face substantial structural \nchallenges in building the necessary ecosystem, institutions and capacity for \npromoting and using science, technology, innovation and digitalization to drive \neconomic growth and sustainable development.  \n__________________ \n \n2  Report of the International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action \nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, Port Louis, Mauritius, \n10\u2013 14 January 2005 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.05.II.A.4 and corrigendum), \nchap.

Small island developing States face significant challenges in data collection, \nanalysis, technical and institutional capacity, which hinders evidence-informed \npolicymaking, monitoring progress and accessing development financing, and we \nemphasize that capacity-building for stronger data governance and management will \nallow small island developing States to support better data collection, protection, \ntransparency and data sharing.  \n20. We welcome and call for support for the efforts of small island developing States \nin establishing a Small Island Developing States Centre of Excellence in Antigua and \nBarbuda that will be launched at the fourth International Conference on Small Island \nDeveloping States, which will include, inter alia, a small island developing States \ndata hub, a technology and innovation mechanism and an Island Investment Forum.  \n21. Acknowledging that small island developing States are highly dependent on \nimports, with limited export capacity, and face current account deficits and limited \nfiscal space, compounded by limited access to concessional financing, small island \ndeveloping States seek the support of the international community to:  \n \n(a) \nDevelop and expand their productive capacity by: \n \n(i) \nUndertaking national productive capacities gap assessments;  \n \n(ii) Implementing holistic productive capacities development programmes;  \n \n(iii) Investing in higher productivity sectors, including in advanced \ntechnologies and digital economy to provide better paying jobs for people in \nsmall island developing States and reduce brain drain and labour mobility;  \n \n(b) \nIncrease trade and investment by: \n \n(i) \nDesigning prioritized trade and investment strategies to consolidate \nmarket opportunities in existing sectors and markets and identify opportunities \nfor economic diversification to reduce vulnerability;  \n \n(ii) Enabling market access in goods and services for small island developing \nStates by considering trade rules, as appropriate, that take into account the \nspecial circumstances of small island developing States, and encouraging the \nfull utilization of preferential market access by improving the application of \ntrade rules and their transparency for small island developing States, in \ncompliance with World Trade Organization commitments; \n \n(iii) Strengthening local, national and regional institutions as well as the \nregulatory and domestic policy environment and trade facilitation bodies;  \n \n(iv) Enabling \nbusiness \nenvironments \nfor \nprivate \nsector \ninvestment, \nentrepreneurship, especially micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, \ncooperatives and enterprise development;  \n \n(v) \nStrengthening capacity for resource mobilization, investment flows \nmonitoring, and firm-level data collection, analysis and use; \n \n(vi) Supporting the establishment of the biennial Island Investment Forum in \nthe Small Island Developing States Centre of Excellence as a dedicated platform \nfor promoting sustainable economic development in small island developing \nStates by promoting investment opportunities, knowledge exchange and \ncollaborative initiatives, addressing the unique challenges faced by small island \ndeveloping States and contributing to their long-term resilience and prosperity; \n \n(vii) Reviewing and reforming old-generation investment treaties that are in \nforce for small island developing States, where desired, with the aim of \nsafeguarding policy space to pursue sustainable development objectives;  \n\nA/RES/78/317 \nThe Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing \nStates: A Renewed Declaration for Resilient Prosperity\n \n24-13495\n6/21 \n \n \n(c) \nPromote resilient and sustainable tourism by: \n \n(i) \nMinimizing pollution and waste, enhancing environmental awareness, \nconserving and protecting the environment, respecting wildlife, biodiversity, \necosystems and cultural diversity;  \n \n(ii) De-risking investments, strengthening cross-sector collaboration between \ntourism and other sectors, and modernizing the sector and related up- and \ndownstream services;  \n \n(iii) Raising awareness of the importance of resilient and sustainable tourism, \nincluding through Global Tourism Resilience Day;11 \n \n(iv) Developing creative and innovative employment solutions, including for \ninformal workers, to provide resilience to the workforce, taking into account \nnational circumstances; \n \n(v) \nEnhancing entrepreneurship, education and training in cultural and \nheritage management and preservation, and in specific domains of the creative \nindustries;  \n \n(vi) Promoting and investing in the resilience of cultural heritage, traditions \nand customs, assets and infrastructure;  \n \n(d) \nPromote sustainable ocean-based economies by: \n \n(i) \nAssisting in the pursuit of opportunities in sustainable fisheries, \naquaculture, mariculture, marine and coastal tourism, ocean-based renewable \nenergy, and mineral and other related resources, sustainable shipping and \nmaritime transport and ports;  \n \n(ii) Establishing public-private sector partnerships and appropriate capital \nmarket instruments and providing technical assistance to stock exchanges and \nsecurity market regulators to enhance bankability and feasibility of projects;  \n \n(iii) Creating and supporting an enabling policy environment to maximize \ndiaspora remittances, investment, skills and experience for research, innovation, \neconomic development and diversification to shift towards environmentally \nsustainable practices and technologies.  \n \n \n \nB. \nFoster safe, healthy and prosperous societies \n \n22. We underline the need to promote peaceful, prosperous, inclusive societies and \nsafe communities for achieving sustainable development, and to build effective, \naccountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Good governance, rule of law, \nhuman rights, fundamental freedoms, equal access to fair justice systems, and \nmeasures to combat corruption and curb illicit financial flows will be integral to our \nefforts.  \n23. We remain concerned that poverty, including extreme poverty, unemployment, \ninequality and exclusion continue to disproportionately affect people in vulnerable \nsituations, particularly women, children, youth, persons with disabilities and older \npersons, and reduces the potential productive capacities in small island developing \nStates. These challenges are compounded by youth unemployment, loss of skilled and \nsemi-skilled labour, through labour mobility, and gender inequality, including unpaid \ncare and domestic work.  \n24. The inadequacy of the health and social protection systems of small island \ndeveloping States and the prevalence of communicable and non-communicable \n__________________ \n \n11  See resolution 77/269. \n\nThe Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing \nStates: A Renewed Declaration for Resilient Prosperity \nA/RES/78/317\n \n7/21\n24-13495 \n \ndiseases in small island developing States pose a threat to sustainable development \nand economic productivity, disproportionately affecting the poorest and those in \nvulnerable situations. \n25. Acknowledging the efforts of small island developing States to improve health \nand social protection systems, boost State capacity in the public sector, and reduce \npoverty, unemployment, inequality and exclusion, small island developing States seek \nthe support of the international community to:  \n \n(a) \nStrengthen health systems by: \n \n(i) \nPromoting and ensuring equitable and timely access to affordable and \nquality health-care services in order to achieve universal health coverage, \nleaving no one behind, noting that any external financing should be aligned with \nnational and regional priorities;

We acknowledge that the widespread, rapid and adverse impacts of climate \nchange continue to pose increasing risks to small island developing States and their \nefforts to achieve sustainable development, while representing the greatest threats to \nthe survival and viability of their people and natural ecosystems. Even with limiting \nglobal warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, small island \ndeveloping States will continue to incur severe loss and damage.  \n\nThe Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing \nStates: A Renewed Declaration for Resilient Prosperity \nA/RES/78/317\n \n11/21\n24-13495 \n \n28. Small island developing States are gravely concerned that global emissions are \nnot in line with modelled global mitigation pathways consistent with the temperature \ngoal of the Paris Agreement, and that there is a rapidly narrowing window out to 2030 \nto raise ambition and implement existing commitments in order to keep warming to \n1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels within reach, which is crucial to the \nsustainable development of small island developing States.  \n29. Small island developing States have extraordinary marine and terrestrial \nbiodiversity that, in many cases, is fundamental to their livelihoods, culture and \nidentity, but their vulnerabilities are drastically limiting the resources and means by \nwhich they can protect their ecosystems and the natural environment. The ocean and \nits resources are under considerable stress from anthropogenic sources, impacting \nsmall island developing States, which are especially dependent on their maritime \nresources for their food security and livelihoods.  \n30.
