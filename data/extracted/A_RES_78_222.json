responsibility to protect the \nSyrian population and to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all persons \nwithin its territory and subject to its jurisdiction,  \n \nDeploring the fact that March 2023 marked 12 years since the peaceful uprising \nand its brutal repression that led to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, which \nhas had and continues to have a devastating impact on civilians, including through \ngrave violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations of \ninternational humanitarian law,  \n \nStrongly condemning the grave human rights

chlorine gas, and \nsulfur mustard, which are prohibited under international law, and acts of violence by \nthe Syrian regime that foment sectarian tensions within the Syrian population, \n \nWelcoming the work of the Investigation and Identification Team of the \nOrganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, noting its findings in its three \nreports to date, including most recently its report of January 2023 which found \nreasonable grounds to believe that the chemical weapons attack in Douma on 7 April \n2018 was perpetrated by the Syrian Arab Republic and found that Russian forces were \nco-located at the base in the Syrian Arab Republic from which the Syrian regime \nlaunched the attack on Douma, and anticipating the publication of its reports into \nfurther chemical weapons attacks, including those perpetrated in Mari\u2018 on \n1 September 2015,  \n \nCondemning in the strongest possible terms the repeated use of chemical \nweapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, including the instances independently \nattributed by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United \nNations Joint Investigative Mechanism and the Investigation and Identification Team \nof the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, noting that the Joint \nInvestigative Mechanism determined that the Syrian Arab Armed Forces had been \nresponsible for attacks that released toxic substances in 2014 and 2015 and that \nIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Da\u2019esh) had used sulfur \nmustard in 2015 and 2016, and further concluded in October 2017 that the Syrian \nArab Air Force had been responsible for the use of chemical weapons on 4 April 2017 \nin Khan Shaykhun, and noting also that the Investigation and Identification Team \nconcluded in April 2020 that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian \nAir Force had carried out three chemical weapons attacks in Ltamenah in March 2017 \nand further concluded in April 2021 that there were reasonable grounds to believe the \nSyrian Air Force had carried out a chemical weapons attack in Saraqib in February \n2018 and further concluded in January 2023 that there were reasonable grounds to \nbelieve the Syrian Arab Air Force had carried out a chemical weapons attack in \nDouma on 7 April 2018 and found that Russian forces were co-located at the base in \nthe Syrian Arab Republic from which the Syrian regime launched the attack on \nDouma, \n \nNoting with grave concern that the Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Human Rights, in a report of June 2022, has identified 306,887 \ncivilians by full name, together with an established date of death and location, who \nwere killed in the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic between March 2011 and \nMarch 2022 and that, of those identified, 26,727 were women and 27,126 were \nchildren, recalling also that the list compiled by the Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Human Rights indicates a minimum verifiable number and is \ncertainly an undercount of the actual number of killings,  \n \nRecalling its demand that all parties, especially the Syrian regime, take all \nappropriate steps to protect civilians, including members of ethnic and religious \ncommunities, \n \nReiterating that the only sustainable solution to the current crisis in the Syrian \nArab Republic is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, under the \nauspices of the United Nations, that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian \npeople in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) of 18 December 2015, \nwith a view to establishing credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governance, with the \nfull, equal and

12 July 2022 and 2672 (2023) of 9 January 2023 \nhave not yet been extended, noting the statement of 13 July by the Syrian Arab \nRepublic that acknowledged the need for cross-border humanitarian assistance, and \ntaking further note of the decisions by the Syrian Arab Republic to consent to the use \nof the Bab al-Hawa crossing for six months, and the Bab al-Salamah and Ra\u2018i \ncrossings for an additional three months, by the United Nations and its specialized \nagencies for the purpose of delivering humanitarian assistance, but remaining \nconcerned by the limited timeframe, which is insufficient, and emphasizing the need \nfor all actors to ensure such access is sustained and unhindered as requested by \nhumanitarian agencies, and for United Nations humanitarian operations in the country \nto remain guided by the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality \nand independence, \n \nReiterating the urgent need to strengthen efforts to address the humanitarian

resolutions 2532 (2020) of 1 July 2020 and 2565 (2021) of \n26 February 2021, while noting with extreme concern the recent rise in hostilities in \ndifferent parts of the country, and reaffirming that Member States must ensure that \nany measures taken to counter terrorism comply with all their obligations under \ninternational law, in particular international human rights law, international refugee \nlaw and international humanitarian law, while continuing to support legitimate \ncounter-terrorism operations against Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also \nknown as

conflict, and continue to be among the worst affected and on multiple \ngrounds, including given that many women have become the main or sole \nbreadwinners for their families, a situation that may be exacerbated by the enforced \ndisappearance of their loved ones, while facing increased caring responsibilities and \nalarming levels of violence, \n \nNoting with deep concern the culture of persistent and pervasive impunity from \nwithin the Syrian regime for the most serious violations of international law and \nviolations and abuses of human rights law committed during the present conflict, \nsome of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity, which has \nprovided a fertile ground for further violations and abuses,  \n \nEmphasizing the importance of

\nA/RES/78/222\n \n5/16\n23-25991 \n \n \nExpressing grave concern at the continued indiscriminate use of force by the \nSyrian regime against civilians, which continues to cause immense human suffering \nand fomented the spread of violent extremism and violent extremist groups and which \ndemonstrates the continuing failure of the Syrian regime to protect the population and \nimplement the relevant resolutions and decisions of United Nations bodies and has \ncreated a safe haven and operating environment for perpetrators of war crimes and \ncrimes against humanity, \n \nExpressing grave concern also at the remaining presence of violent extremism \nand violent extremist groups, terrorists and terrorist groups, and strongly condemning \nall violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian \nlaw committed in the Syrian Arab Republic by any party to the conflict, in particular \nIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as

the primary responsibility to take all feasible measures to account for persons \nreported missing as a result of hostilities and to put in place appropriate channels \nenabling response and

comply \nwith the deconfliction mechanism, \n \nEmphasizing that the humanitarian cross-border mechanism remains an \nessential and life-saving channel to address the humanitarian needs of a significant \nportion of the population of the Syrian Arab Republic, which cannot be reached \nthrough existing operations within the Syrian Arab Republic, and emphasizing the \nimportance of

Arab Republic remains displaced from their homes, including 5.3 million \nrefugees living in neighbouring countries and more than 6.8 million internally \ndisplaced persons inside the country, of whom

\nDeplores and condemns in the strongest terms the continued armed \nviolence by the Syrian regime against the Syrian people since the beginning of the \npeaceful protests in 2011, and demands that
