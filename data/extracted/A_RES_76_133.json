appropriate social protection systems and measures and in which it was \nacknowledged that social protection floors can provide a basis from which to address \npoverty, vulnerability and homelessness, and are therefore essential to end the \nsituation of marginalization of persons experiencing and at risk of homelessness and \nhelp them to integrate into society,  \n \nRecognizing that addressing homelessness through affordable housing and other \ntargeted policies and social protection systems for all assists Member States in \nrealizing the right to adequate housing as part of their

homelessness,  \n \nNoting with concern that homelessness among adolescents and youth is a major \nconcern in many countries, and that youth living in poverty experience additional \ndeprivations to their standard of living, including lack of access to decent jobs, quality \neducation and training and health, putting them at greater risk of bearing the negative \neconomic consequences of shocks such as pandemics, \n \nMindful of the particular challenges faced by homeless women and girls, \nincluding gender-based violence and lack of access to adequate hygienic equipment \nand health

lack of physical housing, but is often \na disaffiliation process interrelated with poverty, lack of full and productive \nemployment, decent work and access to infrastructure, as well as other socioeconomic \nissues that may constitute a loss of family, community and a sense of belonging, and, \n\nA/RES/76/133 \nInclusive policies and programmes to address homelessness, \nincluding in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\n \n21-19157\n4/7 \n \ndepending on national context, can be described as a condition where a person or \nhousehold lacks safe habitable space, which may compromise their ability to enjoy \nsocial relations, and includes people living on the streets, in other open spaces or in \nbuildings not intended for human habitation, people living in temporary \naccommodation or shelters for people experiencing homelessness, and, in accordance \nwith national legislation, may include, among others, people living in severely \ninadequate accommodation without security of tenure and access to basic services,  \n \nNoting with concern that people, inter alia, women and girls, experiencing or at \nrisk of homelessness are already in vulnerable situations and disproportionately \naffected by serious health concerns, which further increase their vulnerability to \nglobal pandemics such as COVID-19, recognizing that this is influenced by a lack of \nhousing and housing inadequacy, nutritious food, a lack of access to safe drinking \nwater and sanitation and health-care services, as well as inequalities and poverty, \nparticularly in the wake of lockdowns,  \n \nStressing the urgent need to build on COVID-19 recovery efforts and to \naccelerate action at all levels and by all stakeholders to fulfil the vision and goals of \nthe 2030 Agenda, and emphasizing the need for concerted action pursuant to all \nrelevant major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and \nrelated fields and their

million persons forcefully evicted every year; \n \n2. \nCalls upon Member States to ensure the promotion and protection of all \nhuman rights, in accordance with their obligations under international

homelessness and other \npeople in vulnerable situations, is crucial for the advancement of global sustainable \ndevelopment;  \n \n4. \nUrges Member States to consider people experiencing
