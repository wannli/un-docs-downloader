Stresses the need to promote meaningful regional integration to encompass \ncooperation among countries in a broader range of areas than just trade and trade \nfacilitation, including investment, research and development and policies aimed at \naccelerating regional industrial development and regional connectivity, that this \napproach is aimed at fostering structural change and economic growth in landlocked \ndeveloping countries as a goal, and also as a means of collectively linking regions to \nglobal markets, that this would enhance competitiveness and help to maximize \nbenefits from globalization and that documentation and the sharing and dissemination \nof best practices are important to allow cooperating partners to benefit from each \nother\u2019s experience;  \n \n26. Recognizes that the economies of many landlocked developing countries \nare still reliant on a few export commodities, which often have low value addition, \nstresses the need for renewed and strengthened partnerships for development to \n\nFollow-up to the second United Nations Conference \non Landlocked Developing Countries \nA/RES/72/232\n \n7/10 \n17-23309 \n \nsupport landlocked developing countries in diversifying their economic base and \nenhancing value addition to their exports by entering and moving up global value \nchains through the development of their productive capacities, including through \nprivate sector involvement, and the development of small and medium-sized \nenterprises, with a view to increasing the competitiveness of the products of \nlandlocked developing countries in export markets, and welcomes the establishment \nof the Technology Facilitation Mechanism in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda;  \n \n27. Underlines that, in order for landlocked developing countries to fully \nutilize their export and trade potential, it is important to undertake measures, \nconsistent with relevant international rules and obligations, that promote structural \neconomic transformation capable of reducing the negative impact of their \ngeographical disadvantages and external shocks, creating jobs and ultimately leading \nto the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions and inclusive and \nsustainable growth and development, stresses that each landlocked developing \ncountry has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and \nthat the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be \noveremphasized, and in this regard stresses that the national development efforts of \nlandlocked developing countries need to be supported by an enabling international \neconomic environment;  \n \n28. Emphasizes that infrastructure, industry and innovation are strongly \nconnected, share the common goal of achieving inclusive and sustainable economic \ndevelopment and contribute to poverty eradication, and recognizes that inclusive and \nsustainable industrialization is integral to the structural transformation of the \neconomies of all countries, including the landlocked developing countries; \n \n29.
