\n\nA/RES/78/4 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on universal \nhealth coverage\n \n23-20107\n2/18 \n \n \n2. \nReaffirm and renew our political commitment to accelerate the \nimplementation of the 2019 political declaration of the high-level meeting of the \nGeneral Assembly on universal health coverage, which reaffirms that health is a \nprecondition for and an outcome and indicator of the social, economic and \nenvironmental dimensions of sustainable development and the implementation of the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and continues to inspire our action and \nenhance our efforts to achieve universal health coverage by 2030, including financial \nrisk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, \neffective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all;  \n \n3. \nReaffirm General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, \nentitled \u201cTransforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d, \nstressing the need for a comprehensive and people-centred approach, with a view to \nleaving no one behind, reaching the furthest behind first, and the importance of health \nacross all the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \nwhich are integrated and indivisible;  \n \n4. \nReaffirm General Assembly resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the \nAddis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment, which reaffirmed strong political commitment to address the challenge \nof financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels for sustainable \ndevelopment in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity;  \n \n5. \nReaffirm the political declarations adopted at the high-level meetings of \nthe General Assembly on HIV and AIDS, on tackling antimicrobial resistance, on \nending tuberculosis, on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, \nand on improving global road safety as well as General Assembly resolutions on the \ncontrol and elimination of malaria;  \n \n6. \nAcknowledge the importance of coordination across health-related \nprocesses taking place during the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, \nparticularly the high-level meetings on universal health coverage, tuberculosis and \npandemic prevention, preparedness and response, while also looking forward to the \nconvening of the high-level meetings on antimicrobial resistance in 2024 and \nnon-communicable diseases in 2025;  \n \n7. \nRecall World Health Assembly resolution 76.4 of 30 May 2023, entitled \n\u201cPreparation for the high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on \nuniversal health coverage\u201d;  \n \n8. \nRecognize that universal health coverage is fundamental for achieving the \nSustainable Development Goals related not only to health and well-being, but also to \neradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, ending \nhunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, ensuring inclusive and \nequitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities, achieving \ngender equality and empowering all women and girls, promoting sustained, inclusive \nand sustainable economic growth and decent work for all, reducing inequalities within \nand among countries, ensuring just, peaceful and inclusive societies and to building \nand fostering partnerships, while reaching the goals and targets included throughout \nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is critical for the attainment of healthy \nlives and well-being for all, with a focus on health outcomes throughout the life \ncourse;  \n \n9. \nReaffirm the importance of national ownership and the primary role and \nresponsibility of governments at all levels to determine their own path towards \nachieving universal health coverage, in accordance with national contexts and \npriorities, and underscore the importance of political leadership for universal health \ncoverage beyond the health sector in order to pursue whole-of-government and \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on universal \nhealth coverage \nA/RES/78/4\n \n3/18\n23-20107 \n \nwhole-of-society approaches, as well as health-in-all-policies approaches, equity-\nbased approaches and life-course approaches;  \n \n10. Recognize that health is an investment in human capital and social and \neconomic development, towards the full realization of human potential, and \nsignificantly contributes to the promotion and protection of human rights and dignity \nas well as the empowerment of all people;  \n \n11. \nRecognize that universal health coverage implies that all people have \naccess, without discrimination, to nationally determined sets of the needed promotive, \npreventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative essential health services and \nessential, safe, affordable, effective and quality medicines and vaccines, diagnostics \nand health technologies, including assistive technologies, while ensuring that the use \nof these services does not expose the users to financial hardship, with a special \nemphasis on the poor, vulnerable and marginalized segments of the population;  \n \n12. Recognize that health inequities and inequalities within and among \ncountries, as well as social and economic injustices, continue to be pervasive and \nshould be tackled through political commitment, concerted action, global solidarity \nand international cooperation in order to address social, economic, environmental and \nother determinants of health, and further recognize that reported averages of global, \nregional and national progress on universal health coverage may mask inequalities;  \n \n13. Recognize the interrelatedness between poverty and other social and \neconomic determinants of health and the realization of the right of everyone to the \nenjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, without \nfinancial hardship, and, in particular, the fact that ill health can be both a cause and a \nconsequence of poverty;  \n \n14. Recognize the fundamental importance of equity, social justice and social \nprotection mechanisms as well as the elimination of the root causes of discrimination \nand stigma in health-care settings to ensure universal and equitable access to quality \nhealth services without financial hardship for all people, particularly for those who \nare vulnerable or in vulnerable situations;  \n \n15. Recognize the consequence of the adverse impact of climate change, \nnatural disasters, extreme weather events as well as other environmental determinants \nof health, such as clean air, safe drinking water, sanitation, safe, sufficient and \nnutritious food and secure shelter, for health and in this regard underscore the need to \nfoster health in climate change adaptation efforts, underlining that resilient and \npeople-centred health systems are necessary to protect the health of all people, in \nparticular those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations, particularly those \nliving in small island developing States;  \n \n16. Recognize that food security and food safety, adequate nutrition and \nsustainable, resilient and diverse nutrition-sensitive food systems promote healthier \npopulations and are important elements to address malnutrition in all its forms, while \nreaffirming that health, water and sanitation systems must be strengthened \nsimultaneously to end malnutrition;  \n \n17. Recognize the importance of the prevention, treatment and control of \nnon-communicable diseases and the promotion of mental health and well-being in \ncontributing to a better quality of life, and the importance of addressing risk factors \nthrough promoting healthy diets and lifestyles, including regular physical activity, to \nprevent and reduce overweight and obesity;  \n \n18. Express deep concern that the level of progress and investment to date \nremain insufficient to meet target 3.8 of the Sustainable Development Goals, and that \nat the current pace of progress towards universal health coverage up to one third of \n\nA/RES/78/4 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on universal \nhealth coverage\n \n23-20107\n4/18 \n \nthe world\u2019s population will remain underserved by 2030, and in this regard note with \nregret that:  \n \n(a) \nThe expansion of service coverage has slowed compared to pre-2015 \ngains, with minimal or no progress made since 2019;  \n \n(b) \nTrends in financial protection are worsening, with the incidence of \ncatastrophic out-of-pocket spending on health having increased from 12.6 per cent in \n2015 to 13.5 per cent in 2019 and 4.4 per cent of the global population in 2019 were \npushed or further pushed into extreme poverty due to out-of-pocket payments for \nhealth;  \n \n(c) \nThere is a global shortfall of 523 million people in achieving the \ncommitment made in the political declaration of 2019 to progressively provide \n1 billion additional people by 2023 with quality essential health services and quality, \nsafe, effective, affordable and essential medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and health \ntechnologies;  \n \n19. Acknowledge that despite major health gains over the past decades, there \nhas not been enough progress in implementing measures to address the health needs \nof all, in part due to the disruption of essential health services during the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic, noting that:  \n \n(a) \nNon-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, \nchronic respiratory diseases and diabetes, are collectively responsible for 74 per cent \nof all deaths worldwide, with 86 per cent of the 17 million people who died \nprematurely, or before reaching 70 years of age, occurring in low- and middle-income \ncountries, and cancer accounting for approximately 10 million deaths globally in \n2020;  \n \n(b) \nMore than 1 billion people live with a mental health disorder and those \nwith severe mental health conditions die on average 10 to 20 years earlier than the \ngeneral population, with suicide accounting for more than 1 in 100 deaths annually, \nnumbering approximately 703,000 deaths annually;  \n \n(c) \nHarmful use of alcohol and substance abuse contribute to 3 million deaths \na year, and more than 8.7 million deaths a year are linked to tobacco use, with 80 per \ncent of 1.3 billion tobacco users globally living in low- and middle-income countries;  \n \n(d) \nGlobally, at least 2.2 billion people have a near or distance vision \nimpairment, at least 1 billion of which could have been prevented or have yet to be \naddressed, with 90 per cent of those with unaddressed vision impairment or blindness \nliving in low- and middle-income countries;  \n \n(e) \nProgress on communicable diseases remains off track, with an estimated \n1.3 million new HIV infections in 2022; an estimated 1.6 million deaths from \ntuberculosis and a rise in the tuberculosis incidence rate by 3.6 per cent between 2020 \nand 2021; 247 million malaria cases globally; 1.65 billion people still requiring \ntreatment and care for neglected tropical diseases; and viral hepatitis among the \nleading causes of mortality worldwide with 3 million new hepatitis infections and \nover 1.1 million deaths from hepatitis-related illnesses every year;  \n \n(f) \nProgress in reducing maternal mortality has stagnated in recent years, with \nalmost 800 maternal deaths every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy \nand childbirth, a global maternal mortality ratio of 223 per 100,000 live births, and \nalmost 95 per cent of these deaths occurring in low and lower-middle-income \ncountries;  \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on universal \nhealth coverage \nA/RES/78/4\n \n5/18\n23-20107 \n \n \n(g) \nFive million children, almost half of whom were newborns, died before \nreaching their fifth birthday in 2021, mostly due to preventable or treatable causes, \nwith around 45 per cent linked to undernutrition;  \n \n(h) \n25 million children under the age of 5 years missed out on routine \nimmunization in 2021, a 5 per cent decline from 2019 and the largest sustained decline \nin childhood vaccinations in approximately 30 years;  \n \n(i) \nThere are nearly 1.3 million preventable deaths and an estimated 50 \nmillion injuries each year as a result of road traffic crashes;  \n \n(j) \nAnnually, approximately 4.95 million deaths are associated with bacterial \nantimicrobial resistance and 1.27 million deaths are directly caused by bacterial \nantimicrobial resistance, with one in five of these deaths occurring in children under \nthe age of 5, often from previously treatable infections;  \n \n(k) \nAlmost 2 million people continue to die every year from preventable \noccupational diseases and injuries;  \n \n(l) \nEvery year, environmental factors contribute to around 13 million deaths, \nwith ambient and indoor air pollution causing at least 7 million preventable deaths, \nin which ambient air pollution in both cities and rural areas was estimated to have \ncaused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2019;  \n \n(m) Globally, an estimated 2.4 billion people are currently living with a health \ncondition that may benefit from rehabilitation and that rehabilitation needs are largely \nunmet globally and that in many countries more than 50 per cent of people do not \nreceive the rehabilitation services they require;  \n \n20. Recognize the increasing gap between life expectancy and healthy life \nexpectancy for older persons and note that despite the progress achieved at the global \nlevel, many health systems continue to be inadequately prepared to identify and \nrespond to the growing needs of the rapidly ageing population, including the \nincreased prevalence of non-communicable diseases;  \n \n21. Express concern that over 1.5 million people aged 10\u201324 years died in \n2021, with the leading causes of death from injuries, including road traffic injuries, \ndrowning, interpersonal violence, self-harm, and maternal conditions such as \ncomplications from pregnancy and childbirth, and recognize that comprehensive \naction to ensure their physical, mental and social well-being is needed;  \n \n22. Express concern that persons with disabilities often experience health \ninequities, including due to lack of knowledge, negative attitudes and discriminatory \npractices within the health workforce, with many likely to die 20 years earlier than \nthose without disabilities, and experience higher health costs and gaps in service \navailability, including for primary care, long-term care, assistive technologies and \nspecialized services;  \n \n23. Recognize that migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons often \nface barriers that limit their access to essential health services, including high costs, \nlanguage and cultural differences, discrimination, administrative hurdles, and in this \nregard note the need to accelerate efforts, at all levels, to integrate public health \nconsiderations into migration policies and incorporate the health needs of migrants in \nnational and local health-care services, policies and plans in ways which are \ntransparent, equitable, non-discriminatory, people-centred, race- and gender-\nresponsive, disability-inclusive and child-sensitive, and which leave no one behind;  \n \n24. Note \nwith \nconcern \nthat \nIndigenous \nPeoples \noften \nexperience \ndisproportionately poorer health outcomes and may face considerable barriers to \naccessing primary health care and essential health services;  \n\nA/RES/78/4 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on universal \nhealth coverage\n \n23-20107\n6/18 \n \n \n25. Express concern that the unmet health-care needs, in particular among \npoor households that cannot afford the cost of health services, can result in increased \nmorbidity and mortality due to lack of or delayed access;  \n \n26. Note that the high prices of some health products, and inequitable access \nto such products within and among countries, as well as financial hardships associated \nwith high prices of health products, continue to impede progress towards achieving \nuniversal health coverage;  \n \n27. Note with deep concern that the COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted \nthe provision of essential health services in countries, with 92 per cent of countries \nreporting disruptions during the height of the pandemic resulting in millions of excess \ndeaths globally, and has reinforced and created new obstacles to the full \nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, increased extreme \npoverty, widened inequalities and had a disproportionate impact on people in \nvulnerable situations;  \n \n28. Note with serious concern the severe shortcomings the COVID-19 \npandemic has revealed at the national, regional and global levels in preparedness for, \ntimely and effective prevention and detection of, and response to potential health \nemergencies, including in the capacity and resilience of health systems, and express \nregret for the severe impact of the pandemic, while recognizing the link between \npandemic prevention, preparedness and response and universal health coverage;  \n \n29. Express deep concern about the uneven access of developing countries, \nparticularly African countries, to safe, quality, efficacious, effective, accessible and \naffordable vaccines against COVID-19, and emphasize the need to enhance the \ncapacities of developing countries to achieve universal health coverage and have \nequitable access to vaccines and health technologies and means to respond to and \nrecover from the COVID-19 and other pandemics, as well as reaffirming the need to \nstrengthen the support for national, regional and multilateral initiatives that aim to \naccelerate the development and production of and equitable access to COVID-19 \ndiagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, and take note of the Declaration on the Right \nto Development;  \n \n30. Recognize the fundamental role of primary health care in achieving \nuniversal health coverage and other Sustainable Development Goals and targets, as \nwas declared in the Declaration of Alma-Ata and the Declaration of Astana, and \nfurther recognize that primary health care, including community-based primary health \ncare, brings people into first contact with the health system and is the most inclusive, \neffective and efficient approach to enhance people\u2019s physical and mental health, as \nwell as social well-being, noting that primary health care and health services should \nbe high-quality, safe, comprehensive, integrated, accessible, available and affordable \nfor everyone and everywhere, including those who live in remote geographical \nregions or in areas difficult to access, noting the work of the World Health \nOrganization on the operational framework for primary health care;  \n \n31. Note that 90 per cent of essential interventions for universal health \ncoverage can be delivered using a primary health-care approach, including at the local \ncommunity levels, and that an estimated 75 per cent of the projected health gains from \nthe Sustainable Development Goals could be achieved through primary health care, \nincluding saving over 60 million lives and increasing average life expectancy by 3.7 \nyears by 2030;  \n \n32. Recognize the importance of community-based health services as a critical \ncomponent of primary health care and as a means of ensuring universal and equitable \naccess to health for all which can be instrumental in achieving universal health \ncoverage, particularly when delivered in low-resource areas;  \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on universal \nhealth coverage \nA/RES/78/4\n \n7/18\n23-20107 \n \n \n33. Recognize also that primary health care can contribute to raising health \nliteracy and public awareness and to addressing health-related misinformation, \ndisinformation and hate narratives, including during public health emergencies, and \nin preventing, preparing for and responding to infectious disease outbreaks and, in \nthis regard, acknowledge the potential role of community-led initiatives and \ncommunity engagement in building trust in health systems;  \n \n34. Recognize the importance of water, sanitation, hygiene, waste \nmanagement and electricity services in health-care facilities for health promotion, \ndisease prevention and the safety of both patients and health workers, and therefore \nexpress serious concern that 22 per cent of health-care facilities lack basic water \nservices, half lack basic hand hygiene facilities at point of care and at toilets, 10 per \ncent have no sanitation service, one in four facilities does not practice waste \nsegregation, and that close to 1 billion people in low- and lower-middle income \ncountries are served by health-care facilities with unreliable or no electricity supply; \n \n35. Note the negative effects on health caused by the overall lack of access to \nsafe water, hygiene and sanitation services, including for menstrual health and \nhygiene management and maternal health services, which contribute to the \nempowerment of women and girls and the enjoyment of their human rights; \n \n36. Recognize that there are significant gaps in the financing of health systems \nacross the world, particularly in the allocation of public and external funds on health, \nand that such financing can be more efficient, considering that:  \n \n(a) \nOn average, in low- and middle-income countries more than one third of \nnational health expenditure is covered by out-of-pocket expenses, leading to high \nlevels of financial hardship, and government spending accounts for less than 40 per \ncent of funding for primary health care;  \n \n(b) \nExternal funding represents just 0.2 per cent of global health expenditure \nbut plays an important role in health spending in developing countries, accounting for \nabout 30 per cent of national health expenditure on average in low-income countries;  \n \n(c) \nAn estimated 20 to 40 per cent of health resources are being wasted \nthrough inefficiencies, which significantly affects the ability of health systems to \ndeliver quality services and improve public health;  \n \n37. Recognize that fighting corruption at all levels and in all its forms is a \npriority and that corruption is a serious barrier to effective resource mobilization and \nallocation and diverts resources away from activities that are vital for poverty \neradication and sustainable development, which may undermine efforts to achieve \nuniversal health coverage;  \n \n38. Express deep concern at the continued global shortfall of health workers \nand the projected global shortfall of more than 10 million health workers by 2030, \nprimarily in low- and middle-income countries, while noting that regions with the \nhighest burden of disease continue to have the lowest health workforce densities to \ndeliver essential health services, and that disparities at national level persist between \nrural, remote and hard-to-reach areas compared to urban areas, and further note that \nhealth worker migration accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic with \napproximately 15 per cent of health workers working outside their country of birth or \nfirst professional certification, recognizing the need to strengthen the World Health \nOrganization Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health \nPersonnel;  \n \n39. Recognize the need to invest in training, developing, recruiting and \nretaining a skilled health workforce, as fundamental to strong and resilient health \nsystems, while stressing the need to improve working conditions and management of \n\nA/RES/78/4 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on universal \nhealth coverage\n \n23-20107\n8/18 \n \nthe health workforce to ensure the safety of health workers, inter alia from all forms \nof violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, and harassment in the \nworkplace and the lack of adequate infection controls and protections, as well as \nstress, burnout and other impacts on mental health;  \n \n40. Further recognize that globally, women comprise approximately 70 per \ncent of the health workforce, and in some health professions more than 90 per cent, \nface a 24 per cent pay gap compared to men across the health and care sector, and \ncontinue to face significant barriers in accessing leadership and decision-making \nroles, occupying just an estimated 25 per cent of leadership roles;  \n \n41. Recognize that a coherent approach to strengthen the global health \narchitecture as well as health system resilience and universal health coverage are \ncentral for effective and sustainable prevention, preparedness and response to \npandemics and other public health emergencies, and recognize also the value of a One \nHealth approach that fosters cooperation between the human health, animal health \nand plant health, as well as environmental and other relevant sectors and that \nstrengthening early warning and response systems contributes to health system \nresilience;  \n \n42. Note that the increasing number of complex emergencies is hindering the \nachievement of universal health coverage and that coherent and inclusive approaches \nto safeguard universal health coverage in emergencies are essential, including through \ninternational cooperation, ensuring the continuum and provision of essential health \nservices and public health functions, in line with humanitarian principles;  \n \n43. Recognize that humanitarian emergencies have a devastating impact on \nhealth systems, leaving people, especially people in vulnerable situations, without \nfull access to health-care services and exposing them to preventable diseases and \nother health risks;  \n \n44. Recognize the role of Governments to strengthen legislative and \nregulatory frameworks and institutions to support equitable access to quality service \ndelivery for the achievement of universal health coverage, including through \nengagement with their respective communities and stakeholders;  \n \n45. Recognize that people\u2019s engagement, particularly of women and girls, \nfamilies and communities, and the inclusion of all relevant stakeholders are core \ncomponents of health system governance that empower all people in improving and \nprotecting their own health, giving due regard to addressing and managing conflicts \nof interest and undue influence, contributing to the achievement of universal health \ncoverage for all, with a focus on health outcomes.  \n \nWe commit to scale up our efforts and further implement the political \ndeclaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage of 2019 and to \nachieve the health-related Sustainable Development Goals and targets through the \nfollowing actions:  \n \n46. Strengthen national efforts, international cooperation and global solidarity \nat the highest political level to accelerate the achievement of universal health \ncoverage by 2030, with primary health care as a cornerstone, to ensure healthy lives \nand promote well-being for all throughout the life course, and in this regard \nre-emphasize our resolve:  \n \n(a) \nTo progressively address the global shortfall of 523 million people without \naccess to quality essential health services and safe, effective, quality, affordable \nessential medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and health technologies, in order to provide \ncoverage for 1 billion additional people by 2025, with a view to covering all people \nby 2030;  \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on universal \nhealth coverage \nA/RES/78/4\n \n9/18\n23-20107 \n \n \n(b) \nTo reverse the trend of rising catastrophic out-of-pocket health \nexpenditure by providing measures to ensure financial risk protection and eliminate \nimpoverishment due to health-related expenses by 2030, with special emphasis on the \npoor as well as those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations;  \n \n47. Increase and sustain political leadership at the national level for the \nachievement of universal health coverage by strengthening legislative and regulatory \nframeworks, promoting policy coherence and ensuring sustainable and adequate \nfinancing to implement high-impact policies to protect and promote people\u2019s health, \nincluding by providing financial risk protection, and comprehensively addressing \nsocial, economic, environmental and other determinants of health by working across \nall sectors through health-in-all-policies approach, and by engaging stakeholders in \nan appropriate, coordinated, comprehensive and integrated, whole-of-government \nand whole-of-society approach, and to promote social participation;  \n \n48. Ensure that no one is left behind, with an endeavour to reach the furthest \nbehind first, and address the physical and mental health needs of all, while respecting \nand promoting human rights and the dignity of the person and the principles of \nequality and non-discrimination, as well as empowering those who are vulnerable or \nin vulnerable situations, including women, children, youth, persons with disabilities, \npeople living with HIV/AIDS, older persons, people of African descent, Indigenous \nPeoples, refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants, and those living in \npoverty and extreme poverty in both urban and rural areas, people living in slums, \ninformal settlements or inadequate housing;  \n \n49. Strengthen national health plans and policies based on a primary health-\ncare approach to support the provision of a comprehensive, evidence-based, \nnationally determined and costed package of health services with financial protection \nfor all, to promote and enable access to the full range of integrated, quality, safe, \neffective, affordable and essential health services, medicines, vaccines, diagnostics \nand health technologies needed for health and well-being throughout the life course;  \n \n50. Strengthen referral systems between primary and other levels of care to \nensure their effectiveness;  \n \n51. Implement the most effective, high-impact, quality-assured, people-\ncentred, gender-, race- and age-responsive and disability-inclusive and evidence-\nbased interventions to meet the health needs of all throughout the life course, and in \nparticular those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations, ensuring universal \naccess to nationally determined sets of integrated quality health services at all levels \nof care for promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative care in a \ntimely manner;  \n \n52. Continue to explore ways to integrate, as appropriate, safe and evidence-\nbased traditional and complementary medicine services within national and local \nhealth systems, particularly at the level of primary health care, according to national \ncontext and priorities, while ensuring safety and quality of care, and in this regard \nrecognize the important role and capacities of the World Health Organization and \nother relevant actors to support Member States with relevant evidence-based \nguidance;  \n \n53. Scale up efforts to build and strengthen quality, people-centred, \nsustainable and resilient health systems and enhance their performance by improving \npatient safety built on a foundation of strong primary health care and coherent \nnational, regional and local policies and strategies for quality and safe health services, \nnoting that universal health coverage can only be achieved if the services and medical \nproducts are safe, effective and affordable and are delivered in a timely, equitable, \nefficient and integrated manner;  \n\nA/RES/78/4 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on universal \nhealth coverage\n \n23-20107\n10/18 \n \n \n54.
