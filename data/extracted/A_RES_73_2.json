\n4. \nRecognize that action to realize the commitments made for the prevention and \ncontrol of non-communicable diseases is inadequate and that the level of progress and \ninvestment to date is insufficient to meet target 3.4 of the Sustainable Development \nGoals and that the world has yet to fulfil its promise of implementing, at all levels, \nmeasures to reduce the risk of premature death and disability from non-communicable \ndiseases; \n5. \nAcknowledge the progress achieved by some countries in the implementation of \ntheir commitments made in 2011 and 2014 for the prevention and control of four \nmajor non-communicable diseases, namely, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer \nand chronic respiratory diseases, by reducing their main common risk factors, namely, \ntobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity, and by \naddressing the underlying social, economic and environmental determinants of \nnon-communicable diseases and the impact of economic, commercial and market \nfactors, as well as by improving disease management to reduce morbidity, disability \nand mortality; \n6. \nRecognize that many countries still face significant challenges in the \nimplementation of their commitments, and remain deeply concerned that the burden \nof non-communicable diseases continues to rise disproportionately in developing \ncountries and that every year 15 million people between the ages of 30 and 69 die \nfrom non-communicable diseases and that 86 per cent of these premature deaths occur \nin developing countries;
