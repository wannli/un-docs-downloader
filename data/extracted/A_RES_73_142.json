by, for \nand with persons with disabilities, and of the note by the Secretariat that provides an \noverview of the flagship report,16 \n \nRecognizing that persons with disabilities make up an estimated 15 per cent of \nthe world\u2019s population, or 1 billion people, of whom an estimated 80 per cent live in \ndeveloping countries, and that persons with disabilities are disproportionately \naffected by poverty, \n \nAcknowledging the Secretary-General\u2019s decision to conduct an institutional \nreview of the current United Nations approach to mainstreaming disability across its \noperations, which would inform the preparation of an internal policy and action plan \nto strengthen the ability of the United Nations system to mainstream disabilities, in \nline with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development, \n \nGravely concerned that persons with disabilities, including women, children, \nyouth, persons with albinism, indigenous peoples and older persons, continue to be \nsubject to multiple, aggravated and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting \nthat, while progress has already been made by Governments, the international \ncommunity and the United Nations system in mainstreaming disability, in particular \nthe rights of persons with disabilities, as an integral part of the development agenda, \nmajor challenges remain, \n \nConcerned that women and girls with disabilities are often among the most \nvulnerable and marginalized in society and are at a greater risk of experiencing all \nforms of violence, and recognizing the need for national development strategies and \nefforts to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls with \ndisabilities, the elimination of all forms of violence and the realization of their human \nrights, \n \nRecognizing that persons with disabilities are often disproportionately affected \nin situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies \nand the occurrence of natural disasters and in their aftermath, and that they may \nrequire specific protection and safety measures, recognizing also the need to support \nfurther participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in the development of \nsuch measures and decision-making processes relating thereto, in order to ensure \ndisability-inclusive risk reduction and humanitarian action, and recognizing further \nthe special coping mechanisms developed by persons with disabilities to withstand \nthe effects of conflict and natural disasters, \n \nRecognizing also the contribution of families towards ensuring the full \nenjoyment by persons with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms \non

full and equal enjoyment of the rights of persons with \ndisabilities and to ensure a safe and supportive family environment for persons with \ndisabilities, \n \nRecognizing further the collective responsibility of Governments to uphold the \nprinciples of human dignity, equality, non-discrimination and equity at the global \nlevel, and in this sense stressing the duty of Member States to achieve the full \napplication and implementation of the international normative framework on persons \nwith disabilities and human rights and development, \n__________________ \n \n16 A/73/220. \n\nA/RES/73/142 \nInclusive development for and with persons with disabilities\n \n18-22177\n4/10 \n \n \nConcerned that access to health-care services remains a challenge for persons \nwith disabilities, who are more than three times as likely as persons without \ndisabilities to be unable to obtain health care when they need it, owing to, inter alia, \na lack of financial resources and inaccessible public transport and facilities, \n \nRecognizing that eliminating discrimination, ensuring equal access to social \nprotection floors and safety nets and enhancing responsive support and services to \npersons with disabilities are critical to promoting inclusive development for all, \n \nRecognizing also that, while considerable progress has been made, the \nmainstreaming of disabilities, including the rights of persons with disabilities, \nremains a global challenge, and recognizing that further efforts are needed to \nstrengthen the normative and operational links to effectively integrate the rights, \nparticipation, perspectives and needs of persons with disabilities into development \npolicies and programmes, and, in particular, into the implementation of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development, \n \nNoting the need for Member States, the United Nations system and other \nstakeholders to further strengthen the normative framework on disability, including \nthe rights of persons with disabilities, in line with the pledge of \u201cleaving no one \nbehind\u201d of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to consider disability \nas a global issue, cutting across the pillars of the United Nations, \n \nStressing its resolve to build inclusive societies and, in this regard, the \nimportance of mainstreaming the rights, participation, perspectives, needs and well-\nbeing of persons with disabilities into all relevant strategies and programmes for \nsustainable development, and reaffirming the valued existing and potential \ncontributions made by persons with disabilities to the overall well-being and diversity \nof their communities, \n \nRecognizing the rights of persons with disabilities with respect to full, \nmeaningful and effective participation and inclusion in society, and therefore \nrecognizing also that persons with disabilities should have the opportunity to be \nactively involved in all aspects of public, political, economic, cultural, social and \nfamily life, on an equal basis with all others, including in decision-making processes \nabout policies and programmes, including national and international development \nprogrammes, with a view to ensuring that such policies and programmes are inclusive \nof and accessible to persons with disabilities, \n \nUnderlining the need for urgent action by all stakeholders towards the adoption \nand implementation of more ambitious disability-inclusive national development \nplans, strategies and actions, backed by increased international cooperation and \nsupport, \n \nStressing the need for capacity development efforts aimed at empowering \npersons with disabilities and their representative organizations to ensure equal access \nto quality education, full and productive employment and decent work on an equal \nbasis and without discrimination to persons with disabilities, including by promoting \naccess to inclusive education systems, skills development, volunteering opportunities \nand vocational and entrepreneurial training in order to enable persons with disabilities \nto attain and maintain maximum independence, \n \nRecognizing the importance of promoting accessibility, mobility and road safety \nfor persons with disabilities in the context of cities and other human settlements, and \nthat accessibility is a means of achieving inclusive societies and development, \n \nRecognizing also the growing contribution of sport to the realization of \ndevelopment and peace, and stressing that major international sporting events, such \nas the international Paralympic Games, should be organized in the spirit of peace, \n\nInclusive development for and with persons with disabilities \nA/RES/73/142\n \n5/10\n18-22177 \n \nmutual understanding, friendship and tolerance, where persons with disabilities have \nan opportunity to organize, develop and participate in disability-specific sporting and \nrecreational activities, on an equal basis with others, and where the spirit of fair play \nprevails, violence is banned and ethical principles are upheld, \n \nConcerned that the continuing lack of reliable statistics, data and information \non the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels \ncontributes to their exclusion in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving \ndevelopment planning and implementation that is inclusive of persons with \ndisabilities, recognizing that high-quality, timely, accessible, reliable and \ndisaggregated data are critical to measuring progress and ensuring that no one is left \nbehind, and further noting the need for enhancing capacity-building support to \ndeveloping countries, including the least developed countries and small island \ndeveloping States, to increase significantly the availability of such data, \n \nStressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons \nwith disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics, 17  and their \nupdates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to \ndisaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, \nand underlining the need for internationally comparable data, such as but not limited \nto the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund Module on Child Functioning and the tools \nand materials produced by the Washington Group on Disability Statistics, to assess \nprogress on development policies that are inclusive of persons with disabilities, \n \nConcerned that the lack of high-quality data required to provide viable baselines \nand measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals for persons with \ndisabilities poses a significant challenge to effectively monitor the implementation of \nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for persons with disabilities, and in \nthis regard welcoming the call for the disaggregation of data by disability in the 2030 \nAgenda, which recognizes the need to significantly increase the availability of high-\nquality, accessible, timely and reliable data to measure progress in the implementation \nof the Goals for persons with disabilities, \n \n1. \nTakes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General, \nentitled
