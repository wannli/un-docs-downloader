The ocean and its ecosystems are \nadversely affected by climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Action is not \nadvancing at the speed or scale required to meet Goal 14 and realize the 2030 Agenda. \nA healthy, productive and resilient ocean is essential for a sustainable ocean-based \neconomy, food security and nutrition, and underpins deep cultural and social \nconnections. We must act with urgency to face this challenge with bold, ambitious, \njust and transformative action, and ensure that all people, including women and girls, \npersons with disabilities, youth, people in vulnerable situations, Indigenous Peoples \nand local communities, are fully and meaningfully empowered and included in ocean-\nrelated decision-making as appropriate. \n4. \nWe emphasize that our actions to implement Goal 14 should be in accordance \nwith, reinforce and not duplicate or undermine existing legal instruments, \narrangements, processes, mechanisms or entities. We affirm the need to enhance the \nconservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its resources by implementing \ninternational law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \nSea,4 which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of \nthe oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of \u201cThe future we want\u201d. 5 \n5. \nWe welcome our decision to take ambitious action to protect, conserve, \nsustainably use and restore the ocean and its ecosystems as included in the Pact for \nthe Future.6 \n \nConserving the ocean and its ecosystems \n6. \nWe stress that the ocean plays an essential role in mitigating the adverse effects \nof climate change, including through ocean-based adaptation and resilience. We are \ndeeply concerned that the ability of the ocean and its ecosystems to act as a climate \nregulator and to support adaptation has been weakened. The ocean and its ecosystems \nare adversely impacted by ocean acidification and climate change, including ocean \nwarming and the slowdown of ocean circulation, compounded by marine pollution, \nbiodiversity loss, eutrophication and deoxygenation. \n7. \nWe underline the importance of interlinkages between the ocean, climate and \nbiodiversity and call for enhanced and coordinated global action to minimize the \nimpact of climate change and ocean acidification on the health of the ocean, its species \nand its ecosystems as well as coastal communities, including those who rely on the \nocean for their food and livelihoods. \n_______________ \n \n1 Resolution 70/1. \n \n2 Resolution 76/296, annex. \n \n3 Resolution 71/312, annex. \n \n4 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1833, No. 31363. \n \n5 Resolution 66/288, annex. \n \n6 Resolution 79/1. \n\nOur ocean, our future: united for urgent action \nA/RES/79/314\n \n3/9\n25-10885 \n \n8. \nWe emphasize the particular importance of implementing the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change7 and the Paris Agreement,8 including the \ngoal to limit the temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius above \npre\u2011industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to \n1.5 degrees Celsius, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and \nimpacts of climate change and help to ensure the health, productivity, sustainable use \nand resilience of the ocean and thus our future. We recall that article 2.2 of the Paris \nAgreement states that it will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of \ndifferent national circumstances. We also emphasize the need to adapt to the \nunavoidable effects of climate change. We welcome the decisions adopted during the \ntwenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, in particular the Sharm el-Sheikh \nImplementation Plan, the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to \nthe Convention, in particular the UAE Consensus and its first global stocktake of the \nParis Agreement, and the twenty-ninth session of the Conference of the Parties to the \nConvention, in particular the decision on the new collective quantified goal on climate \nfinance. We welcome the convening of the ocean and climate change dialogue through \nthe United Nations climate change conferences. \n9. \nWe affirm the importance of full and effective implementation of the Convention \non Biological Diversity9 and its Protocols, as well as the Kunming-Montreal Global \nBiodiversity Framework,10 including its ocean-related goals and targets, as well as its \nmission to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 and to place the global \ncommunity on a path towards realizing the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity, and \nrecognize the role of conserving, restoring and sustainably using the ocean, seas and \nmarine resources in achieving these objectives.  \n10. As adopted at the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the \nConvention on Biological Diversity and agreed upon as global targets in the \nKunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, we will ensure and enable that \nby 2030 at least 30 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas, and of marine and \ncoastal areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem \nfunctions and services, are effectively conserved and managed through ecologically \nrepresentative, well-connected and equitably governed systems of protected areas and \nother effective area-based conservation measures, and at least 30 per cent of areas of \ndegraded ecosystems are under effective restoration. In this regard, we will take \neffective legal, policy, administrative and capacity-building measures at all levels, as \nappropriate, to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of benefits that arise from the \nutilization of genetic resources and from digital sequence information on genetic \nresources, as well as traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources. These \nefforts should be in line with the Convention on Biological Diversity and should \nrecognize and respect the integral role and rights of Indigenous Peoples, as established \nin the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,11 and local \ncommunities, including over their Indigenous and traditional territories where \napplicable, in line with section C of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity \nFramework.  \n_______________ \n \n7 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1771, No. 30822. \n \n8 Adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \nFCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21. \n \n9 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1760, No. 30619. \n \n10 United Nations Environment Programme, document CBD/COP/15/17, decision 15/4, annex. \n \n11 Resolution 61/295, annex. \n\nA/RES/79/314 \nOur ocean, our future: united for urgent action\n \n25-10885\n4/9 \n \n11. \nWe affirm our commitment to continued cooperation to address climate change-\nrelated sea level rise and its effects, and acknowledge the ongoing work of the General \nAssembly to address sea level rise, including through the convening of the high-level \nmeeting on sea level rise, held in New York on 25 September 2024, and take note of \nthe request by the General Assembly for the President of the General Assembly to \norganize a one-day high level plenary meeting of the Assembly at its eighty-first \nsession. We recognize that climate change-related sea level rise disproportionately \nimpacts small island developing States, least developed countries and coastal \ncommunities, especially in developing countries, and acknowledge the urgent need \nfor greater international cooperation and collective action to enhance their adaptive \ncapacities and build resilience while mitigating climate change. We are determined to \nstrengthen international cooperation to support those who are particularly vulnerable \nto the adverse effects of climate change. \n12. We commend the leadership of small island developing States in highlighting \nand aiming to address sea level rise, and recall the endorsement of the 2021 Pacific \nIslands Forum Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the Face of Climate \nChange-related Sea Level Rise, the 2023 Pacific Islands Forum Declaration on the \nContinuity of Statehood and the Protection of Persons in the Face of Climate Change-\nrelated Sea Level Rise, the 2021 Alliance of Small Island States Leaders\u2019 Declaration \nand the 2024 Alliance of Small Island States Leaders\u2019 Declaration on Sea Level Rise \nand Statehood. \n13. We note the work of the International Law Commission on the topic \u201cSea-level \nrise in relation to international law\u201d and encourage States to share their views on the \nvarious aspects of this topic.  \n14. We recall the 2024 advisory opinion of the International Tribunal for the Law of \nthe Sea on the request for an advisory opinion submitted by the Commission of Small \nIsland States on Climate Change and International Law. \n15. We remain concerned by the high and rapidly increasing levels of plastic \npollution, including in the marine environment, and its negative impacts on the \nenvironment and ecosystems and the environmental, social and economic dimensions \nof sustainable development. We recognize the importance of addressing this global \nchallenge, and thus reaffirm our commitment to develop an international legally \nbinding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, which \ncould include both binding and voluntary approaches, based on a comprehensive \napproach that addresses the full life cycle of plastic, taking into account, among other \nthings, the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 12 as \nwell as national circumstances and capabilities, in line with the mandate set out in \nUnited Nations Environment Assembly resolution 5/14 of 2 March 2022.13 \n16. We reaffirm our shared commitment to accelerating action to prevent, \nsignificantly reduce and control marine pollution of all kinds. We support the work of \nthe International Maritime Organization in addressing ship-sourced pollution, \nunderwater radiated noise from ships and dumping in the marine environment. We \nencourage all competent international organizations, in particular the Food and \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, to address the issue of abandoned, \nlost or otherwise discarded fishing gear and its impact on habitats and marine species.  \n17. We reaffirm the need to adopt a source-to-sea approach and strengthen \nintegrated coastal zone and ocean management, marine spatial planning, climate \n_______________ \n \n12 Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Rio de Janeiro, \n3\u20134 June 1992, vol.

We commit to nature-\nbased solutions and ecosystem-based approaches to protect, conserve and restore \ncoastal ecosystems that act as natural buffers, such as mangroves, seagrasses, kelp \nforests, salt marshes and coral reefs, while promoting sustainable livelihoods and \nconserving biodiversity. We stress the importance of scaled-up and accelerated \nimplementation of the Early Warnings for All initiative to ensure that coastal \ncommunities vulnerable to hazardous weather, water or climate events have equitable \naccess to timely, accurate and actionable information and technology.  \n18. We reiterate the need to increase scientific knowledge on deep sea ecosystems \nand recognize the work of the International Seabed Authority in the promotion and \nencouragement of marine scientific research in the Area. Noting the mandate of the \nInternational Seabed Authority, we welcome the progress of the work of the Authority \ntowards the development of robust rules, regulations and procedures for exploitation \nof mineral resources in the Area, and reiterate the importance of the ongoing \nelaboration and standardization by the Authority, pursuant to article 145 of the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, of rules, regulations and procedures to \nensure the effective protection of the marine environment, for, inter alia, the \nprotection and conservation of the natural resources of the Area and for the prevention \nof damage to the flora and fauna of the marine environment from harmful effects that \nmay arise from activities in the Area. \n \nPromoting sustainable ocean-based economies \n19. We recognize the tremendous opportunities offered by sustainable ocean-based \neconomies for States, especially developing countries and particularly small island \ndeveloping States and least developed countries, to eradicate poverty and hunger and \nachieve economic growth and social development, while safeguarding the health, \nresilience and productivity of marine and coastal ecosystems for present and future \ngenerations. We recognize that international trade and environmental policies should \nbe mutually supportive and World Trade Organization-consistent. In this regard, we \nreaffirm our commitment to supporting the implementation, as appropriate, of the \nAntigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States: A Renewed \nDeclaration for Resilient Prosperity14 and the Doha Programme of Action for the \nLeast Developed Countries.15 \n20. We recognize the fundamental role of management tools, such as sustainable \nocean plans, in achieving sustainable ocean-based economies and the sustainable \nmanagement of ocean areas under national jurisdiction. In this regard, we \nacknowledge the voluntary commitments of some coastal States to ensure that 100 \nper cent of ocean areas under national jurisdictions are sustainably managed by 2030. \n21. We are deeply troubled by the continuously degrading accumulated trends at the \nglobal level in the status of marine fish stocks due to unsustainable practices, \nchallenges from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, overcapacity and \noverfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, loss of biodiversity, pollution and \naquatic ecosystems degradation, while noting variability between and within regions. \nWe therefore call for decisive and collective action to ensure sustainable fisheries and \naquaculture systems, including by, inter alia, enhancing transparency, the use of \ntechnology, enhancing science- and knowledge-based management, promoting, \nscaling up and replicating successes, and working together to end illegal, unreported \nand unregulated fishing. As a key pillar of the ocean economy, fisheries and \n_______________ \n \n14 Resolution 78/317, annex. \n \n15 Resolution 76/258, annex. \n\nA/RES/79/314 \nOur ocean, our future: united for urgent action\n \n25-10885\n6/9 \n \naquaculture provide livelihoods, economic opportunities, food security and nutrition \nto millions worldwide. We emphasize the urgent need to improve sustainability of \nfisheries and aquaculture to combat malnutrition and poverty, particularly for people \nin vulnerable situations, while ensuring the long-term health of marine ecosystems. \n22. We encourage all States to promote participatory management schemes for \nsmall-scale fisheries in accordance with national laws, regulations and practices, and \nin line with the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-scale Fisheries \nin the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication. \n23. We highlight the importance of efforts in regional fisheries management \norganizations to establish sound management measures for sustainable fisheries and \nto contribute to global efforts to end illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. We \nencourage States, individually and through regional fisheries management \norganizations and arrangements, to strengthen or establish rules and regulations on \nand promote the use of the best available technology, including, where appropriate, \nelectronic monitoring systems to ensure effective monitoring, control and \nsurveillance as well as compliance with relevant conservation and management \nmeasures. \n24. We encourage World Trade Organization members to deposit their instruments \nof acceptance of the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies to enable its entry into force \nand implementation. We invite members to advance and conclude negotiations as soon \nas possible and by the Fourteenth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade \nOrganization on additional provisions on fisheries subsidies that contribute to \novercapacity and overfishing to achieve a comprehensive fisheries subsidies \nagreement, and recognize that appropriate and effective special and differential \ntreatment for developing country members and least developed country members \nshould be an integral part of these negotiations. \n25. We recognize the critical role of maritime transport, maritime routes and marine \ninfrastructure in the global economy, trade, food and energy security, as well as the \nsignificant challenges of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in this sector. We take \nnote of the adoption by the International Maritime Organization of the 2023 Strategy \non Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships and its ambition to reach net-\nzero emissions from international shipping by or around, i.e. close to, 2050. \n \nAccelerating action \n26. We note the adoption of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological \nDiversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction16 and call upon States and regional \neconomic integration organizations that have not done so to consider signing and \nratifying, approving or accepting the Agreement. We emphasize the importance of the \nearly entry into force and effective implementation of the Agreement.  \n27. We call upon States to promote awareness and education campaigns at the local, \nnational, regional and international levels to inform the public about the importance \nof maintaining a healthy ocean and resilient marine ecosystems. We commit to \nensuring that people, especially children and youth, are empowered with the relevant \nknowledge and skills, through promoting and supporting quality education and \nlifelong learning for ocean literacy.  \n28. We emphasize the critical need for national ocean accounting and mapping of \ncoastal and marine ecosystems, and of the ocean floor, as appropriate, to inform policy \n_______________ \n \n16 A/CONF.232/2023/4. \n\nOur ocean, our future: united for urgent action \nA/RES/79/314\n \n7/9\n25-10885 \n \ndecisions, development planning, integrated coastal zone management, and \nconservation planning. \n29. We encourage cooperation to strengthen regional initiatives, regional seas \nconventions and action plans, the United Nations Environment Programme Regional \nSeas Programme and, where appropriate, establish coordination mechanisms for the \nintegrated management and sustainable development of coastal and marine areas, \nfostering biodiversity and ecological corridors and promoting conservation, \nrestoration and the sustainable use of marine resources at the local, national and \nregional levels. \n30. Ocean action must be based on the best available science and knowledge, \nincluding, where available, traditional knowledge, knowledge of Indigenous Peoples \nand local knowledge systems, while recognizing and respecting the rights of \nIndigenous Peoples, as established in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \nIndigenous Peoples, and local communities, in conserving, restoring and sustainably \nusing the ocean, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. To that end \nwe: \n \n(a) \nAffirm the value of strengthening sharing of knowledge and expertise, \nincluding, where there is free, prior and informed consent, the knowledges, \ninnovations, practices and technologies of Indigenous Peoples and local communities, \ntraditional knowledge and local knowledge systems;  \n \n(b) \nSupport new scientific research to address the multiple challenges facing \nthe ocean, including climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, food security and \nnutrition, water management, energy transitions and disaster risk; \n \n(c) \nCommit to further improving the scientific understanding of the ocean and \nsupporting sustainable science- and knowledge-based measures, exchanges and \ncollaboration to accelerate action, including through the Regular Process for Global \nReporting and Assessment of the State of the Marine Environment, including \nSocioeconomic Aspects, and its World Ocean Assessments, the United Nations \nDecades of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and on Ecosystem \nRestoration (2021\u20132030), and relevant assessments concerning ocean science and \nknowledge, such as those prepared under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and \nEcosystem Services;  \n \n(d) \nSupport a strong science-policy interface to provide timely, credible and \nsalient scientific and socioeconomic information to inform policies and actions. We \nnote the opportunity to promote the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of \nthe ocean by engaging decision-makers and fostering scientific inclusiveness through \nscientific research, and also note the proposal for an International Platform for Ocean \nSustainability; \n \n(e) \nSupport the use of diverse and multilingual scientific knowledge from a \nvariety of sources, from different regions and in different languages; \n \n(f) \nCommit to strengthening coordinated international, regional, subregional \nand national scientific observation and data collection efforts, including, as \nappropriate, through the development of integrated information management, tools \nsuch as digital representation of the ocean, infrastructure and systems that provide \naccess to reliable, timely and high-quality marine data;  \n \n(g) \nSupport enhancing cooperation, including South-South and triangular \ncooperation, to strengthen mechanisms for collaboration, peer learning, knowledge-\nsharing and exchange of best practices within marine scientific research, and to \n\nA/RES/79/314 \nOur ocean, our future: united for urgent action\n \n25-10885\n8/9 \n \nsupport developing countries in addressing their constraints in access to technology, \nand analysing and using reliable data and statistics; \n \n(h) \nRecognize the contributions of effective area-based management tools, \nsuch as effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-\nconnected marine protected areas and other effective area-based conservation \nmeasures, including through traditional marine tenure and community-based resource \nmanagement, to support the health and resilience of the ocean and coastal ecosystems, \ntheir species and the coastal communities that depend on them, and the need, where \napplicable, to invest in maintaining or enhancing their contributions;  \n \n(i) \nRecognize the important role of the sustainable blue bioeconomy in \nconserving, restoring and sustainably using the ocean. \n31. We recognize that Goal 14 is one of the least funded Sustainable Development \nGoals and that accelerating ocean action globally requires significant and accessible \nfinance and the fulfilment of existing commitments and obligations under relevant \nintergovernmental agreements. It also requires adequate and scaled-up means of \nimplementation for developing countries, in particular small island developing States \nand least developed countries, to address the funding gap of Goal 14. In this regard, \nwe: \n \n(a) \nLook forward to the convening of the Fourth International Conference on \nFinancing for Development, to be held in Seville, Spain, from 30 June to 3 July 2025; \n \n(b) \nCall for greater mobilization of resources from all sources and support the \nuse of suitable financial instruments to accelerate ocean action and ensure the health \nand resilience of the ocean, noting that the utilization of instruments would differ \nbased on different national contexts; \n \n(c) \nStrive to strengthen the provision of scaled-up resources in developing \ncountries, especially small island developing States and least developed countries, \nincluding public, grant-based and concessional finance and non\u2011debt instruments, as \nwell as other types of concessional finance, including from multilateral development \nbanks in line with their mandates, and reiterate the central role of national policies, \ndomestic resources and development strategies; \n \n(d) \nPromote the sustainable ocean-based economy, including as an attractive \ninvestment opportunity through instruments such as blue bonds, blue loans and \npayment for ecosystem services, and encourage the active and meaningful \ninvolvement of the private sector, including banks, insurers and investors in the \ntransition to sustainable ocean-based economies; \n \n(e) \nRecognize the importance of increasing scientific knowledge and \ndevelopment of research capacity of developing countries, in particular small island \ndeveloping States and least developed countries, including through technology \ntransfer on mutually agreed terms and capacity-building, to allow them to invest in \nconservation and restoration efforts and to sustainably use our ocean, seas and marine \nresources for sustainable development;  \n \n(f) \nUnderline the need to support coastal communities, in particular small-\nscale and artisanal fisheries and sustainable aquaculture producers, women and girls, \nyouth, Indigenous Peoples and local communities, in developing and implementing \nlocally driven adaptation measures, and stress the importance of enhancing their \ncapacity to effectively engage, advocate and manage marine resources in a sustainable \nmanner. \n32. We value the voluntary commitments made to implement Goal 14, including at \nUnited Nations Ocean Conferences, and encourage partnerships to expand initiatives \n\nOur ocean, our future: united for urgent action \nA/RES/79/314\n \n9/9\n25-10885 \n \nand increase their impact. We acknowledge the inclusive nature of voluntary \ncommitments and encourage appropriate review and follow-up on the progress on \nvoluntary commitments.  \n33. We emphasize the importance of multilateral ocean governance and the \nintegration of ocean-related issues into relevant multilateral efforts and forums, in \nline with their respective mandates, to ensure that ocean sustainability is effectively \nintegrated and adequately addressed in the relevant discussions and agendas, \nparticularly those directly linked to ocean health. \n34. Conscious of the numerous challenges the ocean faces, we will remain ambitious \nand engaged, and look forward to future United Nations Ocean Conferences.  \n \n",
