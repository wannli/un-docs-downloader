currently exist, especially in the Middle East, \nin this context noting with deep disappointment the non-fulfilment of the agreement \nat the 2010 Review Conference on practical steps to fully

Nuclear Weapons on this issue,  \n \nDeeply disappointed at the continued absence of progress towards multilateral \nnuclear disarmament at the Conference on Disarmament, which has been unable for \nthe past 21 years to agree upon and implement a programme of work, and \ndisappointed that the Disarmament Commission has not produced a substantive \noutcome on nuclear disarmament since 1999,  \n \nDeeply regretting the lack of any substantive outcome of the 2015 Review \nConference,  \n \nDisappointed that the 2015 Review Conference missed an opportunity to \nstrengthen the Treaty on the
