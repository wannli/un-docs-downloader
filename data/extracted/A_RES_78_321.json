International Year of Glaciers\u2019 Preservation and to proclaim \n21 March of each year the World Day for Glaciers, to be observed starting in 2025,  \n \nRecalling also its resolution 77/326 of 25 August 2023 on the International \nDecade of Sciences for Sustainable Development, 2024\u20132033,  \n \nRecalling further its resolution 77/172 of 14 December 2022 on sustainable \nmountain development, in which it proclaimed the period 2023\u20132027 as Five Years \nof Action for the Development of Mountain Regions,  \n \nRecalling its resolution 72/73 of 5 December 2017, in which it proclaimed the \nUnited Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development,  \n \nRecognizing that the need for a worldwide inventory of existing perennial ice \nand snow masses was first considered during the International Hydrological Decade, \ndeclared by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization for \nthe period 1965\u20131974,  \n \nNoting that glaciers and ice sheets are a critical component of the hydrological \ncycle and that the current accelerated melting and retreat of glaciers and melting of \nice sheets have severe impacts on the climate, global sea level, the environment, the \nmaintenance of human well-being and health and sustainable development,  \n \nRecognizing the important role of the cryosphere, including glaciers, snow, ice \nand permafrost, in maintaining ecosystems that provide essential services, which are \ncritical foundations for sustainable development and human well-being, especially \nfor the most vulnerable populations,  \n\nA/RES/78/321 \nDecade of Action for Cryospheric Sciences, 2025\u20132034 \n \n24-14709\n2/3 \n \n \nRecognizing also the importance of initiatives related to the Earth\u2019s

2018\u20132028, \n \nNoting with concern the findings contained in the Sixth Assessment Report of \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and its special reports entitled Global \nWarming of 1.5\u00b0C and The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate,  \n \nNoting with concern also the findings of the 2022 report of the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Union for \nConservation of Nature entitled World Heritage Glaciers: Sentinels of Climate \nChange regarding the accelerated melting of glaciers in world heritage sites, with \nglaciers in a third of those sites projected to disappear by 2050,  \n \nNoting with concern further the findings of the report of the World \nMeteorological Organization entitled State of the Global Climate 2023 regarding the \nprofound changes seen in the cryosphere, illustrating the global scale of climate \nchange,  \n \nRecalling that many United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization world heritage sites, biosphere reserves and global geoparks include \nglaciers, and being aware of the need to assess how these sites designated by the \nOrganization, including local communities, face the loss of glaciers and biodiversity, \nand how scientific data and local knowledge can contribute to a better understanding \nof climate change impact on mountain glaciers and ecosystems,  \n \nAcknowledging the efforts of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization and the World Meteorological Organization in facilitating the \nimplementation of the International Year of Glaciers\u2019 Preservation and coordinating \nrelevant activities,  \n \nTaking note of the invitation, expressed in its resolution 77/158, to \nGovernments, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, major groups, \nother relevant stakeholders and donors to voluntarily contribute to the trust fund in \nsupport of activities for glaciers\u2019 preservation to be coordinated by the Secretary-\nGeneral, in partnership with relevant agencies of the United Nations system, \nincluding the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and \nthe World Meteorological Organization, to support countries in addressing issues \nrelated to accelerated melting of glaciers and its consequences, \n \nWelcoming the initiative of Tajikistan to convene an international conference \ndedicated to glaciers\u2019 preservation in Tajikistan in 2025 and to assume the costs of \nthe conference, and acknowledging its contribution towards the advancement of the \nDecade of Action for Cryospheric Sciences,  \n \nLooking forward to the 2026 United Nations Water Conference to Accelerate the \nImplementation of
