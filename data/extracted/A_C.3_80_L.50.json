persons to seek protection and assistance in other \ncountries as refugees or migrants, and noting the need for reflection on effective \nstrategies to ensure adequate protection and assistance for internally displaced \npersons in this regard, including the need for comprehensive and disaggregated data \nand other measures aimed at preventing and reducing such displacements, \n \nReaffirming
