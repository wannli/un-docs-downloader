Reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of \nresponsible behaviours \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nReaffirming the applicability of international law, including the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, to activities in outer space and the right of all States to explore and \nuse outer space without discrimination of any kind, on a basis of equality and in \naccordance with such law, \n \nRecalling its resolutions 68/50 of 5 December 2013 and 74/32 of 12 December \n2019, \n \nEmphasizing the importance of maintaining outer space as a peaceful, safe, \nstable, secure and sustainable environment for the benefit of all and the significant \ncontribution of outer space activities to social, economic, scientific and technological \ndevelopment, as well as to international peace and security, \n \nReaffirming the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the \nExploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies,1 \nand the obligations for States parties to the Treaty to explore and use outer space for \nthe benefit and in the interests of all countries, and to be guided by the principle of \ncooperation and mutual assistance, \n \nWelcoming the recent adoption by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer \nSpace at its sixty-second session of the Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability \nof Outer Space Activities,2 the implementation of which may have a positive effect \non international peace and security, \n__________________ \n \n1  United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 610, No. 8843. \n \n2  Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-fourth Session, Supplement No. 20 (A/74/20), \nannex II. \n\nA/RES/75/36 \nReducing space threats through norms, rules \nand principles of responsible behaviours\n \n20-16810\n2/3 \n \n \nUrging all States, when developing, planning and executing their space \nactivities, to remain committed to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space and \nto refrain from conducting activities contrary to their obligations under international \nlaw, including those that could threaten the ability of all States to freely use and \nexplore outer space, now and in the future, \n \nStressing that the creation of long-lived orbital debris arising from the deliberate \ndestruction of space systems increases the risk of in-orbit collisions and the potential \nfor misunderstanding and miscalculations that could lead to conflict, \n \nReaffirming that the prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a \ngrave danger for international peace and security, \n \nRecalling the primary role of the Conference on Disarmament on questions \nrelating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space in all its aspects, including \nthe weaponization of outer space and threats from capabilities on Earth, and the \nrelevant responsibilities of the First Committee of the General Assembly and the \nDisarmament Commission, \n \nNoting the rapid advances of technologies in space systems, the use of which \ncould have positive or negative effects on international security, and seeking to \nunderstand how States behave in the light of these developments, \n \nRecognizing that efforts to prevent an arms race and to prevent conflict from \nbeginning in or extending into outer space must include consideration of the use of \nall potential technologies and means, whether on Earth or in outer space, \n \nStressing that uses of these technologies and means for purposes inconsistent \nwith the objectives of maintaining international stability and security, including \nagainst signals for operators and users and the terrestrial infrastructure supporting \nspace systems, can lead to the perception of threats and can have destabilizing effects \non peace and security on Earth, and that such threats already exist in outer space and \non Earth, \n \nRecognizing the need for States to seek to avoid and mitigate the potential \nimpact on peace and security arising from accidents, miscommunication or a lack of \ntransparency, which could lead to miscalculations and the escalation of tensions and \ncontribute to an arms race, \n \nCognizant of the challenges of effectively verifying the capabilities of space \nobjects, which can have both civilian and military applications, interpreting their \nbehaviour or determining whether the systems will be used for purposes inconsistent \nwith the objectives of maintaining international security and stability, while \nreaffirming that verification is one of the essential components of all arms control \ninstruments, \n \nNoting the need for all States to work together to reduce threats to space systems \nthrough the further development and implementation of norms, rules and principles \nof responsible behaviours with the aim of maintaining a peaceful, safe, stable, secure \nand sustainable outer space environment, which might, as appropriate and without \nprejudice, contribute to further consideration of legally binding instruments in this \narea, \n \nRecognizing the importance of the full involvement and equal participation of \nwomen and men in discussions on reducing space threats through responsible \nbehaviours and the need to assess the possible differentiated impacts of such threats, \n \n1. \nAffirms that all States must conduct their activities in the exploration and \nuse of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, in conformity with \n\nReducing space threats through norms, rules  \nand principles of responsible behaviours \nA/RES/75/36\n \n3/3\n20-16810 \n \ninternational law, including the Charter of the United Nations, and urges Member \nStates to take this into account when formulating their space policies; \n \n2. \nEncourages those States that have not yet become parties to the \ninternational treaties governing the exploration and use of outer space to give \nconsideration to ratifying or acceding to those treaties in accordance with their \nnational law, as well as incorporating them into their national legislation; \n \n3. \nExpresses the desire that all Member States reach a common understanding \nof how best to act to reduce threats to space systems in order to maintain outer space \nas a peaceful, safe, stable and sustainable environment, free from an arms race and \nconflict, for the benefit of all, and consider establishing channels of direct \ncommunication for the management of perceptions of threat; \n \n4. \nInvites States members and observers of the Conference on Disarmament \nand the Disarmament Commission to inform those bodies of their national space \nsecurity policies, strategies or doctrines, on a voluntary basis, in accordance with and \nin support of the mandates of those bodies; \n \n5. \nEncourages Member States to study existing and potential threats and \nsecurity risks to space systems, including those arising from actions, activities or \nsystems in outer space or on Earth, characterize actions and activities that could be \nconsidered responsible, irresponsible or threatening and their potential impact on \ninternational security, and share their ideas on the further development and \nimplementation of norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours and on the \nreduction of the risks of
