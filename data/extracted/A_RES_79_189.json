activities that constitute trafficking \nin human organs and includes provisions to prevent and combat this crime, to protect \nits victims and to promote cooperation among parties in the fight against this crime, \nwhich usually has a transnational scope,  \n \nWelcoming the statement issued by the World Medical Association on measures \nfor the prevention and fight against transplant-related crimes, adopted by the seventy-\nfirst World Medical Association General Assembly, in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, in October \n2020, acknowledging that healthcare professionals may play a key role in preventing \nand combating trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal and trafficking \nin human organs, and calling upon policymakers, health authorities and healthcare \nprofessionals to take appropriate measures to counter it,  \n \nAffirming that trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal and \ntrafficking in human organs constitute two distinct crimes that abuse or impair the \nenjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and have significant negative \nhealth implications, and stressing that it is essential to place the protection of all \nhuman rights at the centre of measures to prevent and end such trafficking, \n \nRecognizing that, although trafficking in human organs and trafficking in \npersons for the purpose of organ removal are distinct crimes, both are related to the \nshortage of human organs available for transplantation and to social and economic \ndifficulties that put persons in vulnerable situations, and that prevention of and \nresponse to both crimes must be undertaken in an effective and coordinated manner, \n \nConsidering that the whole process of donation and transplantation of human \norgans should be an established part of national health services provided to the public, \nthat the process should take place under conditions aimed at the protection of human \nrights of donors and recipients of organs and that healthcare systems should be \ninstrumental in ensuring such conditions, \n \nConsidering also that the commercial trade in human organs is prohibited in \nalmost all Member States and that both trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ \nremoval and trafficking in human organs have a profound impact on the health both \nof those who sell their organs and of victims of trafficking in persons for the purpose \nof organ removal, as well as on recipients of organs obtained in such circumstances, \nand that both crimes might represent a threat to public health and may, in some cases, \naffect the integrity and the functioning of healthcare systems,  \n \nAlarmed at the exploitation by criminal groups that take advantage of human \nneeds, poverty and destitution and of other people in vulnerable situations for the \npurpose of trafficking in human organs and trafficking in persons for the purpose of \norgan removal,  \n \nNoting the need to protect the living donors and recipients, who are usually the \nmost vulnerable members of society, from exploitation by traffickers in human \norgans, including by providing them with relevant information on the crimes of \ntrafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal and trafficking in human \norgans, and the health impacts and recovery process, as well as the need to investigate, \nprosecute and punish all actors that knowingly engage in these crimes and to provide \nassistance to victims,  \n \nEmphasizing the importance of respecting and protecting the rights of victims \nof trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal and, when recognized in \nnational legislation, addressing the vulnerability of victims of trafficking in human \norgans, and

vulnerabilities and cause more individuals to become vulnerable \nto trafficking in persons for organ removal,  \n \nConvinced of the need to strengthen local, regional and international \ncooperation for the effective prevention and combating of trafficking in persons for \nthe purpose of organ removal and trafficking in human organs wherever they occur, \nand determined to prevent the provision of safe haven to those who participate in or \nprofit from transnational organized crime and to prosecute such persons for the crimes \nthat they commit,  \n \nConsidering that measures to address
