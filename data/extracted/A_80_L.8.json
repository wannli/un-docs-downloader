We urge States Parties to those instruments to implement them effectively, \nincluding through the Mechanism for the Review of the Implementation of the United \nNations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto.  \n5. \nWe also reaffirm the importance of universal ratification and implementation of \nother relevant international instruments that address trafficking in persons, including \nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child 7 and its optional protocols relevant to \ntrafficking in persons.8  \n6. \nWe recall the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, 9 the \nGlobal Compact on Refugees,10 and take note of Committee on the Elimination of \nDiscrimination against Women general recommendation No. 38 (2020) on trafficking \nin women and girls in the context of global migration. 11  \n7. \nWe also reaffirm our recognition of the definition of trafficking in persons as set \nforth in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, \nEspecially Women and Children, as referenced in the Global Plan of Action and the \nsubsequent Political Declarations. \n8. \nWe reiterate our strong condemnation of trafficking in persons, which \nconstitutes a serious crime and a grave offence to human dignity and physical \nintegrity, a violation and abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms and a \nchallenge to sustainable development, and we note that respect for human rights is an \nimportant basis of comprehensive anti-trafficking strategies. Combating trafficking \nin persons requires the implementation of a comprehensive approach that includes \npartnerships, international cooperation and measures to prevent trafficking, to \nidentify and protect the victims, as well as a criminal justice response, including the \ninvestigation, prosecution and punishment of traffickers.

We reiterate our commitment to promote education and awareness-raising \ncampaigns to prevent trafficking in persons, and we welcome the designation of \n30 July as the World Day against Trafficking in Persons. 12  \n11. \nWe express our serious concern over the significant and enduring trafficking of \nwomen and children, recognize that trafficking in persons disproportionately affects \nthem. We note with concern potential cases of trafficking in women for the \nexploitation of surrogacy. We express grave concern about the increase in child \ntrafficking, primarily for forced labour, forced marriage, sexual exploitation, and \ninvolvement in criminal activities. We note the specific vulnerabilities of children, \nincluding children and youth with disabilities and unaccompanied children, to various \nforms of exploitation, including in the context of travel, tourism and sports, and the \nneed to address them, as well as the cultural practices that justify or tolerate their \ndemand. We call upon Member States to enact or update national laws and establish \ncomprehensive policies, programmes and other measures, as appropriate, that provide \nfor the protection of trafficked women and children from revictimization and \nappropriate assistance and protection in the best interests of the child.  \n12. We express solidarity with and compassion for victims and survivors, we call \nfor full respect of their human rights and recognizing their role as agents of change \nin the global fight against trafficking in persons. We acknowledge the need to actively \ninvolve them, incorporating their perspective and experience in all efforts to prevent \nand combat trafficking in persons, including in designing, implementing, monitoring \nand evaluating such efforts. We will provide victim-centred and trauma-informed \ncare, assistance and services for their recovery and rehabilitation, access to health, \nincluding sexual and reproductive health-care services and mental health and \npsychosocial support services, and seek to enhance the provision of safe shelter, legal \naid, long-term support, reintegration and timely family reunification, including \nprotection and assistance, working also with civil society and other relevant partners. \nWe will ensure that victims are treated with respect and dignity and are not \ninappropriately penalized or adversely affected by any actions taken by government \nauthorities and communities, including criminal, civil, administrative and \nimmigration penalties, for acts that they commit as a direct consequence of their \ntrafficking situation, through the implementation of both the principle of \nnon-prosecution and non-punishment of victims of trafficking subject to national \nlaws, rules and regulations.  \n13. We commit to undertake appropriate measures to facilitate access to justice and \nprotections for victims of trafficking in persons that should not be conditional on their \nparticipation in criminal proceedings, taking into account national legislation, and we \nwill seek to ensure that laws and policies are in place to alleviate reliance on victims\u2019 \ntestimonies. We also commit to take steps to ensure that effective remedies are \navailable, including for damage suffered, as well as for victims who have been \nunjustly penalized for illegal acts committed in connection with their victimization. \nWe further commit to enable a victim-centred, age- and gender-sensitive approach to \ncare and assistance of victims that takes into consideration disability and trauma and \nthat addresses the specific needs of women, youth and children.  \n14. We affirm our commitment to protect the privacy and identity and ensure the \nsafety of victims of trafficking in persons before, during and after criminal proceedings, \nincluding when the victim\u2019s testimony is necessary in legal proceedings, and to \nprotect immediate family members and witnesses, as appropriate, from retaliation by \n__________________ \n \n12  See resolution 68/192.  \n\nA/80/L.8 \n \n25-17125\n4/8 \n \ntraffickers, by ensuring their safety, in accordance with articles 24 and 25 of the \nUnited Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, as applicable. \n15. We reaffirm our commitment to continue our efforts to criminalize trafficking \nin persons in all its forms, to hold traffickers accountable for their crimes through \nprosecutions, and to strengthen cooperation and coordination among Member States \nin countries of origin, transit and destination in order to disrupt and dismantle criminal \nnetworks involved in such crimes, inter alia through the enhancement of information-\nsharing, including through the secure communications channels of the International \nCriminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), where appropriate, as well as through \nmutual legal assistance and extradition, with full respect for domestic law, in \ncombating crimes that might be connected with trafficking in persons, such as money-\nlaundering, corruption, illicit financial flows, the smuggling of migrants, the \ntrafficking in illicit drugs, illicit arms trafficking, cybercrime and all forms of \norganized crime and related illicit finance.  \n16. We commit to enhancing the capacity of law enforcement and criminal justice \nsystems, including the capacity of criminal justice practitioners, to identify, \ninvestigate and prosecute cases of trafficking in persons, including when connected \nto other trafficking-related crimes, and analyse financial flows to detect and dismantle \nthose criminal networks and their financial structures, in collaboration with financial \ninstitutions. We also commit to developing and strengthening national referral \nmechanisms and to use available technology to increase victim referrals and services \nand to identify, seize and forfeit proceeds of crime of those criminal networks. We \nemphasize the importance of regular and specialized professional training for officials \nand practitioners who are involved in preventing, identifying and responding to \ntrafficking in persons, as a key component of an effective and victim-centred \napproach. \n17. We also commit to investigate and prosecute trafficking in persons, and to take \nall appropriate measures to collect, preserve and store evidence of human trafficking, \nincluding when committed for the purpose of, particularly, sexual exploitation. We \nrecognize that trafficking-related crimes often encompass other criminal acts and call \nfor the adoption of prosecutorial policies that ensure accountability for the full range \nof harm suffered by victims. \n18. We are seriously concerned that the scale of global resourcing to prevent and \nfight trafficking in persons does not match the scale of the challenge and in this \nregard:  \n \n(a) \nWe reaffirm our strong support for the United Nations voluntary trust fund \nfor victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, established in \naccordance with the Global Plan of Action, and we invite all stakeholders to \ncontribute to the trust fund, including through the announcement of pledges at the \nquadrennial high-level appraisals of the Global Plan of Action;  \n \n(b) \nWe evince our strong political will and commitment of financial resources \nto effectively address trafficking in persons in all circumstances, acknowledging the \nneed to provide sufficient, reliable, sustainable and predictable resources for national \ntrafficking in persons strategies, especially for developing countries that are \nparticularly affected by mixed and large movements of refugees and migrants, \nincluding countries of origin, transit and destination;  \n \n(c) \nWe will endeavour to provide unearmarked extrabudgetary resources for \nthe offices of the United Nations system which are mandated to combat trafficking in \npersons, consistent with their rules and procedures;  \n\nA/80/L.8\n \n5/8\n25-17125 \n \n \n(d) \nWe stress the need to intensify international and regional cooperation, \nincluding capacity-building, exchange of best practices and know-how and technical \nassistance, especially for developing countries, aimed at strengthening their ability to \nprevent all forms of trafficking, address the special needs of victims, and to strengthen \ntheir criminal justice systems, noting the particular role of the United Nations Office \non Drugs and Crime in this regard;  \n \n(e) \nWe encourage relevant entities and bodies of the United Nations system to \nprovide assistance to Member States for training and capacity-building, upon request, \nincluding gender- and age-sensitive and victim-centred mental health and \npsychosocial support services, that take into consideration disability, for the recovery \nand reintegration of victims; \n \n(f) \nWe reaffirm the significant role of enhanced international cooperation in \npreventing and combating trafficking in persons, including in the area of mutual legal \nassistance and extradition.  \n19. We reiterate, in the strongest terms possible, the importance of strengthening \ncollective action by Member States to end trafficking in persons, including through \nregional, subregional and cross-regional mechanisms, and through partnerships and \ninitiatives with the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders, including, \ninter alia, regional and international organizations, the private sector, the media, \nacademia, parliamentarians and civil society, as well as national human rights \ninstitutions where they exist, in compliance with the Paris Principles. 13 We will \npromote multi-stakeholder partnerships and engage the private sector and civil \nsociety in developing and implementing relevant sustainable initiatives to prevent and \ncombat trafficking in persons, recognizing the important role played by financial \ninstitutions.  \n20. We underline the work of the Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council \non trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and on contemporary forms \nof slavery, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against \nChildren, and other relevant special rapporteurs and representatives, in combating \ntrafficking in persons, and welcome their continued efforts to implement the Global \nPlan of Action and the present Political Declaration.  \n21. We also stress the need to continue to enhance the overall organization and \ncoherence in the global efforts of the United Nations system to respond to trafficking \nin persons, especially in ensuring support to Member States. In this regard, while \nrecalling the mandate of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in \nPersons, we urge the Secretary-General to continue efforts to strengthen coordination \nwithin the United Nations system and to inform Member States thereof through \nexisting reporting channels.  \n22. We recognize the important role played by the Inter-Agency Coordination \nGroup against Trafficking in Persons in the United Nations system, with the United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crime as its coordinator, and recognize with \nappreciation the ongoing efforts of its member entities in this regard. We invite the \nCoordination Group to continue to increase its activities related to the implementation \nof the Global Plan of Action and, to that end, to incorporate aspects of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development relevant to preventing and combating \ntrafficking in persons and to continue to advance the coordination of future activities \nand avoidance of duplication of efforts. We encourage the Coordination Group to \ncontinue to expand its membership to include international intergovernmental entities \nthat have a role in addressing trafficking in persons in all regions.  \n__________________ \n \n13  Resolution 48/134, annex.  \n\nA/80/L.8 \n \n25-17125\n6/8 \n \n23. We reaffirm the central role of the work of the United Nations Office on Drugs \nand Crime in the global fight against trafficking in persons, particularly in providing \ntechnical assistance to Member States, upon their request, to implement the United \nNations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to \nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \nChildren, by making use of existing capacity-building tools, lessons learned from \nMember States and expertise available in other international organizations.  \n24. We reiterate the need for improved data collection and analysis of trafficking in \npersons, disaggregated by sex, age, disability and other relevant factors, including the \nform of exploitation, and using systematic and consistent criteria, to effectively \ncounter trafficking in persons. We thus recognize the importance of improved data \ncollection by national authorities and will enhance international cooperation to this \nend, including through capacity-building, financial support and technical assistance, \nconsistent with our national legislation on data protection, if applicable, and our \nrespective international obligations related to privacy.  \n25. We acknowledge the importance of the biennial Global Report on Trafficking in \nPersons, prepared by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime pursuant to the \nGlobal Plan of Action, and request the Office to continue to collect information on \npatterns, forms and flows of trafficking in persons, at the national, regional and \ninternational levels, in a balanced, reliable and comprehensive manner, to be \npublished in the Global Report, and in ongoing research to estimate the prevalence of \ntrafficking in persons, in close cooperation and collaboration with Member States.  \n26. We underline that the issue of trafficking in persons in situations of armed \nconflict, natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies requires further attention, \nwhile fully respecting the principles of humanitarian assistance. In this regard:  \n \n(a) \nWe recognize that refugees and migrants in large movements face greater \nrisk of trafficking in persons, thus we will work to prevent trafficking among those \naffected by displacement, and provide support with targeted measures to identify \nvictims or those at risk of trafficking in places of first arrival as well as throughout \ntheir journey, through the development of age- and gender-responsive policies and \nprogrammes. We also commit to intensify our efforts to prevent irregular migration \nand create and strengthen pathways for safe, orderly and regular migration to reduce \nthe exposure of people on the move to trafficking in persons, recalling our respective \ncommitments to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration;  \n \n(b) \nWe encourage the training of humanitarian and peacekeeping personnel to \nbe deployed in humanitarian emergencies and peacekeeping operations on responding \nto trafficking in persons, child protection and sexual exploitation and abuse, and \nencourage relevant entities and bodies of the United Nations system to train their \npersonnel, build their technical capacity to assess situations and respond to instances \nof trafficking in persons in these contexts.  \n27. We express our deep concern about the increasing links between armed groups, \nincluding terrorist groups, and trafficking in persons, involving the coercion of \nvictims, in particular of women and girls, into forced marriages, sexual slavery, forced \npregnancy, forced labour, domestic servitude and sexual exploitation, and subjecting \nmen and boys to forced labour or act as combatants.  \n28. We note with concern the increasing misuse of information and communications \ntechnologies, in particular the Internet, to facilitate various aspects of trafficking in \npersons, including the recruitment of individuals through online advertisements for \nonline fraud and scam operations, and with the use of generative artificial \nintelligence, thereby subjecting victims to forced criminality, debt bondage and a \nrange of abusive practices, as well as various forms of exploitations, including online \n\nA/80/L.8\n \n7/8\n25-17125 \n \nchild sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, emphasizing the disproportionate risk \nfaced by persons with disabilities and the need to strengthen digital literacy as a \npreventive measure. We also emphasize the importance of countering such misuse \nwhile respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with our \nobligations under international law. In this regard: \n \n(a) \nWe take note of the adoption of the United Nations Convention against \nCybercrime; Strengthening International Cooperation for Combating Certain Crimes \nCommitted by Means of Information and Communications Technology Systems and \nfor the Sharing of Evidence in Electronic Form of Serious Crimes;14  \n \n(b) \nWe call for the strengthening of law enforcement digital expertise and \ncapacity to conduct proportionate, lawful, accountable and necessary investigations \nin cyberspace, including the dark web, and seize associated electronic evidence. We \nencourage the appropriate use by law enforcement of technology-based solutions that \naddress the global scope of trafficking in persons;  \n \n(c) \nWe express deep concern about the growing misuse of artificial \nintelligence or machine-learning technologies to generate, disseminate hate speech \nfor the purpose of trafficking in persons, including on social media platforms, \nthrough, inter alia, the use of artificial content, including images, videos and other \nforms of media, while also recognizing the potential of such technologies to detect \nand mitigate harmful content when developed and deployed safely; \n \n(d) \nWe further encourage the appropriate use of technology and innovative \ntools by practitioners and central authorities to increase international and, where \nrelevant, cross-border cooperation in criminal matters, recognizing the need for the \nethical use of technology consistent with human rights obligations; \n \n(e) \nWe call for effective partnerships among the public sector, civil society, \nacademia and the private sector, including technology companies, to enhance \ninnovation, cooperation and the use of technology, including artificial intelligence, to \ncombat trafficking in persons. We emphasize the particularly important role played \nby Internet service and access providers, and call upon them to fulfil their \nresponsibilities and promptly detect, report and remove sexual exploitation and abuse \nmaterials related to trafficking in persons, while we commit to taking legislative and \nother measures to facilitate these actions. \n29. We reaffirm that the crime of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ \nremoval constitutes a form of exploitation and an offence against the human dignity \nof the victims that needs a multidisciplinary approach, based on respect for all human \nrights. We condemn the involvement of criminal groups and unethical medical \npersonnel in trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal, and we call for \nbetter coordination and collaboration between criminal justice actors and medical \nprofessionals. We commit to adopting ethical and transparent regulations governing \norgan donations, strengthening legislative frameworks, including the criminalization \nof these practices and provisions to ensure the accountability of the perpetrators, and \nto resourcing such efforts. \n30. We also reaffirm the importance of preventing and combating trafficking in \npersons in supply chains, including by deterring and penalizing fraudulent and abusive \nrecruitment practices. We encourage Member States, multilateral organizations and the \nprivate sector to adopt ethical and transparent practices in their procurement and supply \nchains, and strongly urge them to regularly disclose and provide relevant information. \nWe are mindful of the need to ensure that all actors in global supply chains, including \nintermediaries, who profit from the labour of trafficking victims are to be held \n__________________ \n \n14  Resolution 79/243, annex. \n\nA/80/L.8 \n \n25-17125\n8/8 \n \naccountable, including through sufficiently stringent sanctions and appropriate policy \nand legislation. In this regard, we recall the United Nations Guiding Principles on \nBusiness and Human Rights. 15 We stress the need to establish firewalls between \nimmigration checks and labour inspections, to implement labour standards and to \nimprove government procurement practices to promote decent work. We emphasize \nthe importance of awareness and education campaigns, in partnership with civil \nsociety and the media, to combat acceptance of forced labour. We also urge the \nSecretary-General to ensure that all United Nations procurement does not contain \ngoods and services produced by victims of human trafficking.  \n31. We acknowledge that the gaps between the Global Plan of Action and its \nimplementation by Member States should be closed, and recognize that arrangements \nare needed to ensure the systematic follow-up to and review of all of the commitments \nwe are making at the present high-level meeting, including in the quadrennial high-\nlevel meetings of the General Assembly to appraise progress achieved in the \nimplementation of the Global Plan of Action. We will also promote the development \nof clearer analysis of successful counter-trafficking responses, and assessment and \nevaluation frameworks that include consideration of how laws, policies or practical \nmeasures affect victims of trafficking in persons. \n \n__________________ \n \n15  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations \u201cProtect, \nRespect and Remedy\u201d Framework (A/HRC/17/31, annex). \n",
