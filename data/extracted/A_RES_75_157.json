as well \nas the right to life and human dignity, \n \nAlarmed by the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic is deepening pre-existing \ninequalities that perpetuate all multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, as \nwell as racism, stigmatization and xenophobia, and sexual and gender-based violence, \nincluding domestic violence, and put women and girls at particular risk, compounding \nand further exposing vulnerabilities in the social, political and economic spheres \nwhich are in turn amplifying the impacts of the pandemic on the full and equal \nenjoyment of human rights, and which

health and other essential workers with the necessary \nprotection and support, \n \nConcerned that the increased demand for paid and unpaid care work, which is \nmore often undertaken by women than by men, the unequal sharing of unpaid care and \ndomestic work between women and men and job losses by women, combined with the \ndecreasing accessibility and affordability of childcare, are deepening the already \nexisting gender inequalities in the division of labour and could further exacerbate the \ngender pay gap, the pension gap as well as the care gap, and noting with concern in \nthis regard the increased and unequal share of unpaid care and domestic work placed \non girls, including adolescent girls, which needs to be addressed, \n \nConcerned also by the high incidence of informal and non-standard forms of \nemployment where women are disproportionately represented as this can restrict \nwomen\u2019s universal access to social protection when entitlements are tied closely to \nformal employment, which can perpetuate women\u2019s lack of income or force women \nto continue working thus exacerbating the risk of exposure to COVID-19, \n \nRecognizing that civil society, including non-governmental organizations and \nwomen\u2019s and community-based organizations, youth-led and girl-led organizations, \nand all other stakeholders such as volunteers and national human rights institutions \nwhere they exist, and women peacebuilders in situations of armed conflict and \npost-conflict often provide the front-line contributions of the response to the

pandemic, including in budgetary responses; \n \n3. \nAlso emphasizes the need to develop economic recovery plans that drive \nchange towards inclusive societies by, inter alia, targeting all women and girls, \nespecially those who face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and \nviolence, underlining that economic response, including poverty eradication \nmeasures, social assistance and protection, and fiscal and stimulus packages, must be \nequally accessible to all, be gender-responsive and specifically address the care sector \nand the issues of informal and non-standard forms of employment, and recognize and \ntake measures to reduce and redistribute women\u2019s and girls\u2019 disproportionate share of \nunpaid care and domestic work, and consider focusing on actions

organizations and women\u2019s and community-based \norganizations, youth-led and girl-led organizations, and all other stakeholders such as \nvolunteers and national human rights institutions where they exist, and women \npeacebuilders in situations of armed conflict and post-conflict in protecting the human \nrights and fundamental freedoms of all women and girls during the response to and
