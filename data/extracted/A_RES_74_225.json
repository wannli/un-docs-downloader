countries, \nespecially in rural areas, rely on traditional biomass, coal and kerosene for cooking \nand heating, with disproportionate health and workload impacts on women, children \nand people in vulnerable situations, including an estimated 4 million premature deaths \nannually, that, while the global population without access to electricity fell below \n1 billion, close to 840 million people are still without access to electricity, that \nreliability and affordability remain challenges in many countries, even as the number \nof household connections increases, that Africa accounts for more than half of both \naccess figures and that, even when energy services are available, millions of poor \npeople are unable to pay for them, \n \nNoting with concern that energy represents less than 1 per cent of overall United \nNations expenditure on the Sustainable Development Goals, despite its critical \nimportance also in achieving other goals,  \n \nEmphasizing the critical socioeconomic benefits of affordable, reliable, \nsustainable and modern energy and the need to reframe the understanding of energy \nfrom a technical unit to a requirement for basic social services, including health care, \neconomic development and poverty eradication,  \n \nHighlighting the importance of the empowerment of developing countries to \nachieve universal access through the rapid expansion of affordable, reliable, \nsustainable and modern energy worldwide,  \n \nHighlighting also the significant efforts made in developing countries that \ncontributed to an increase in the global electrification rate to 89 per cent in 2017, and \nstressing the need to further close the electrification gap in many difficult-to-reach \npopulations, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa,  \n \nRecognizing that each country has primary responsibility for its own economic \nand social development and that this will include the mobilization of financial \nresources, as well as capacity-building and the transfer of environmentally sound \ntechnologies to developing countries on mutually agreed terms, including \nconcessional and preferential terms,  \n \nWelcoming the
