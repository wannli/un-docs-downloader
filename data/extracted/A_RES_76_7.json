We urge States parties to those instruments to implement them fully and \neffectively, and welcome the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime to establish a mechanism \nfor the review of the implementation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto. \n4. \nWe also reaffirm our recognition that \u201ctrafficking in persons\u201d means the \nrecruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of \nthe threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of \ndeception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or \nreceiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control \nover another person, for the purpose of exploitation, which includes, at a minimum, \nthe exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, \nforced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the \nremoval of organs, as set forth in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish \nTrafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. \n5. \nWe reiterate that trafficking in persons is a serious crime and a grave offence to \nhuman dignity and physical integrity, a violation and abuse of human rights and a \nchallenge to sustainable development and we note that respect for human rights is an \nimportant basis of comprehensive anti-trafficking strategies. \n6. \nWe reaffirm the importance of universal ratification and implementation of other \nrelevant international instruments that address trafficking in persons, including the \nConvention on the Rights of the Child 5  and its optional protocols relevant to \ntrafficking in persons.6 \n7. \nWe recall the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration 7 and the \nGlobal Compact on Refugees,8 and take note of Committee on the Elimination of \nDiscrimination against Women general recommendation No. 38 (2020) on trafficking \nin women and girls in the context of global migration. 9 \n8. \nWe reiterate our commitment to prevent trafficking in persons, including \nthrough targeted education and awareness-raising campaigns. We welcome the \ndesignation of 30 July as the World Day against Trafficking in Persons. 10 We commit \nto fulfil our obligations and intensify our efforts to prevent and address, with a view \nto eliminating, the demand that fosters trafficking in persons, especially of women \nand girls, for all forms of exploitation, and in this regard to put in place or enhance \npreventive measures, including legislative and punitive measures to deter exploiters, \n__________________ \n \n3  United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2225, No. 39574. \n \n4  Ibid., vol. 2237, No. 39574. \n \n5  Ibid., vol. 1577, No. 27531. \n \n6  Ibid., vols. 2171 and 2173, No. 27531. \n \n7  Resolution 73/195, annex. \n \n8  Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-third Session, Supplement No. 12 (A/73/12 \n(Part I) and A/73/12 (Part II)), part II. \n \n9  CEDAW/C/GC/38. \n \n10  See resolution 68/192. \n\n2021 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the \nUnited Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \nin Persons \nA/RES/76/7A/RES/76/7\n \n3/8\n21-17189 \n \nand those who facilitate or profit from the exploitation of trafficking victims, and hold \nthem accountable. \n9. \nWe reaffirm our commitment to address the social, economic, cultural, political \nand other factors that make people vulnerable to trafficking in persons, such as \npoverty, underdevelopment, irregular migration, statelessness, unemployment, \ninequality, gender inequality, sexual and gender-based violence, discrimination, \nincluding gender and racial discrimination, disability, social and financial exclusion, \nmarginalization, stigmatization, corruption, persecution as well as humanitarian \nemergencies, armed conflicts and natural disasters. We also reaffirm the crucial \nimportance of addressing negative social norms that sustain gender inequality and \ndiscrimination, including the culture of tolerance towards violence against women, \nyouth and children, that make them particularly vulnerable to trafficking in persons. \nWe commit to take strong efforts to include more women in leadership positions and \nall decision-making processes.  \n10. We express our serious concern over the significant and enduring trafficking of \nwomen and children, recognize that trafficking in persons disproportionately affects \nthem, and call upon Member States to enact or update national laws and establish \ncomprehensive policies, programmes and other measures that provide for the \nprotection of trafficked women and children from revictimization and appropriate \nassistance and protection in the best interests of the child. We stress the importance \nof coordinating both national and international cooperation to enhance the positive \neffects of all anti-trafficking efforts.  \n11. \nWe express grave concern that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic \nhas exacerbated existing situations of vulnerability to trafficking in persons, including \nin digital contexts, increasing the number of individuals at risk, exposing victims to \nbigger challenges due to either abandonment or increased confinement by traffickers, \nreduced access to assistance, and the restricted or complete lack of ability to either \nwork or return home, making their living conditions unbearable. We recognize the \nneed to place increased priority and urgency on prevention, planning and coordination, \nboth national and international, to mitigate the impact of emerging and ongoing \nchallenges on trafficking responses and that more global efforts are needed to combat \ndiscrimination against people vulnerable to trafficking in persons, particularly \nmigrants, who are more vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking with the outbreak of \nthe pandemic. We note with concern that sexual and gender-based violence increased \nglobally during the pandemic, and commit to intensifying efforts to eliminate all forms \nof violence against all women and girls in public and private spheres, including \ntrafficking in persons for sexual exploitation and abuse and forced labour.  \n12. We express solidarity with and compassion for victims and survivors, call for \nfull respect of their human rights, and, recognizing their role as agents of change in \nthe global fight against trafficking in persons, acknowledge the need to incorporate \ntheir perspective and experience in all efforts to prevent and combat trafficking in \npersons. We aim to actively involve victims of trafficking in persons in designing, \nimplementing, monitoring and evaluating such efforts. We will provide victim-centred \nand trauma-informed care, assistance and services for their recovery and \nrehabilitation, access to health, including sexual and reproductive health-care services \nand mental health and psychosocial support services, and, working with civil society \nand other relevant partners, monitor and regularly assess such assistance, with the \ninput of victims, and seek to enhance the provision of long-term support and \nreintegration, including protection and assistance. We will ensure that victims are \ntreated with respect and dignity and are not inappropriately penalized or adversely \naffected by laws, policies and other actions taken by government authorities and \ncommunities for acts that they commit as a direct consequence of their trafficking \nsituation. \n\nA/RES/76/7 \n2021 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the \nUnited Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \nin Persons\n \n21-17189\n4/8 \n \n13. We commit to undertake appropriate measures to facilitate access to justice and \nprotections for victims of trafficking in persons that should not be conditional on their \nparticipation in criminal proceedings, taking into account national legislation. We will \nseek to ensure that laws and policies are in place to alleviate reliance on victims\u2019 \ntestimonies, including the use of digital evidence, financial records or other evidence, \nas appropriate. Where the victim\u2019s testimony is necessary, we will ensure that \nprotections are in place for the victims, having regard to their specific vulnerabilities. \nWe also commit to take steps to ensure that effective remedies, including for damage \nsuffered, are available. We also commit to intensify our efforts, subject to our national \nlaws, rules and regulations, to implement the principle of non-punishment of victims \nof trafficking, which should apply to unlawful activity that a victim of trafficking in \npersons has been compelled to be involved in as a direct consequence of their \ntrafficking situation and for all types of punishment, including criminal, civil, \nadministrative and immigration offences. We commit to provide appropriate responses \nto trafficking in persons situations, including through proactive and fair identification \nprocedures, and access to effective remedies for victims who have been unjustly \npenalized for illegal acts committed in connection with their victimization. \n14. We affirm our commitment to protect the privacy and identity and ensure the \nsafety of victims of trafficking in persons before, during and after criminal \nproceedings and to protect immediate family members and witnesses, as appropriate, \nfrom retaliation by traffickers by ensuring their safety in accordance with articles 24 \nand 25 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. \n15. We reaffirm our commitment to continue our efforts to criminalize trafficking \nin persons in all its forms, and to strengthen cooperation and coordination among \nMember States in countries of origin, transit and destination in order to disrupt and \ndismantle criminal networks involved in such crimes, including through, inter alia, \nthe enhancement of information-sharing with full respect for domestic law and mutual \nlegal assistance and extradition in combating crimes that might be connected with \ntrafficking in persons, such as money-laundering, corruption, illicit financial flows, \nthe smuggling of migrants, the trafficking in illicit drugs, and all forms of organized \ncrime. We commit to enhancing the capacity of law enforcement and criminal justice \nsystems to identify, investigate and prosecute cases of trafficking in persons, and \nanalyse financial flows to detect those criminal networks in collaboration with \nfinancial institutions. We also commit to developing and strengthening national \nreferral mechanisms and to use available technology to sustain victim referrals and \nservices and to identify, seize and forfeit ill-gotten gains of those criminal networks. \nWe further commit to strengthening the capacity of criminal justice practitioners, \nincluding law enforcement officials, prosecutors, judges and correction and probation \nofficers, and to enable a victim-centred, age- and gender-sensitive approach to care \nand assistance of victims, that takes into consideration disability and trauma and that \naddresses the specific needs of women, youth and children.  \n16. We are seriously concerned that the scale of global resourcing to fight \ntrafficking in persons does not match the scale of the challenge and in this regard: \n \n(a) \nWe reaffirm our strong support for the United Nations voluntary trust fund \nfor victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, established in \naccordance with the Global Plan of Action, aimed at providing victims of trafficking \nin persons with humanitarian, legal and financial aid through established channels of \nassistance, such as governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental \norganizations, and we invite all stakeholders to contribute to the trust fund, including \nthrough the announcement of pledges at the quadrennial high level appraisals of the \nGlobal Plan of Action; \n\n2021 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the \nUnited Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \nin Persons \nA/RES/76/7A/RES/76/7\n \n5/8\n21-17189 \n \n \n(b) \nWe acknowledge the need to provide sufficient, reliable, sustainable and \npredictable resources for national trafficking in persons strategies;  \n \n(c) \nWe stress the need to intensify international cooperation, including \ncapacity-building, exchange of best practices and know-how and technical assistance, \nespecially for least developed and developing countries, including small island \ndeveloping States, aimed at strengthening their ability to prevent all forms of \ntrafficking and address the special needs of victims, including supporting their \ndevelopment programmes and to strengthen their criminal justice systems;  \n \n(d) \nWe encourage relevant entities and bodies of the United Nations system to \nprovide assistance to Member States, upon request, including through training and \ncapacity-building of relevant authorities in the provision of post-trauma counselling, \nand gender- and age-sensitive and victim-centred mental health and psychosocial \nsupport services for the recovery and reintegration of victims; \n \n(e) \nWe acknowledge the need for public-private partnerships to prevent and \ndetect trafficking in persons, recognizing the important role played by financial \ninstitutions, and take note with appreciation of the initiatives of Member States to \ncontribute to the global fight against trafficking in persons.  \n17. We reiterate, in the strongest terms possible, the importance of strengthening \ncollective action by Member States to end trafficking in persons, including through \nregional, subregional and cross-regional mechanisms, and through partnerships and \ninitiatives with the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders, including, \ninter alia, regional and international organizations, the private sector, the media, \nacademia, parliamentarians and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, \nacademic institutions and faith-based organizations, as well as national human rights \ninstitutions, where they exist, with regard to the Paris Principles. 11 We will promote \nmulti-stakeholder partnerships and engage the private sector and civil society, in \ndeveloping and implementing relevant sustainable initiatives to prevent and combat \ntrafficking in persons. We take note of the work of the Special Rapporteur on \ntrafficking in persons, especially women and children, and the Special Rapporteur on \ncontemporary forms of slavery, in combating trafficking in persons, and welcome \ntheir continued efforts to support the implementation of the Global Plan of Action and \nthe present political declaration.  \n18. We also reiterate the need to continue to enhance the overall organization and \ncoherence in the global efforts of the United Nations system to respond to trafficking \nin persons, especially in ensuring support to Member States. In this regard, while \nrecalling that the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons \nwas established to foster coordination and cooperation among relevant United \nNations system entities and other international organizations involved in combating \ntrafficking in persons, with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime as its \ncoordinator, we urge the Secretary-General to continue efforts to strengthen \ncoordination within the United Nations system and to inform Member States thereof \nthrough existing reporting channels. \n19. We recognize the important role played by the Inter-Agency Coordination \nGroup against Trafficking in Persons in the United Nations system, and recognize \nwith appreciation the ongoing efforts of its member entities to respond to trafficking \nin persons. We invite the Coordination Group to continue to increase its activities \nrelated to the implementation of the Global Plan of Action and, to that end, to \nincorporate aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development relevant to \npreventing and combating trafficking in persons and to continue to advance the \ncoordination of future activities and avoidance of duplication of efforts. We \n__________________ \n \n11  Resolution 48/134, annex. \n\nA/RES/76/7 \n2021 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the \nUnited Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \nin Persons\n \n21-17189\n6/8 \n \nencourage the Coordination Group to continue to expand its membership to include \ninternational intergovernmental entities that have a role in addressing trafficking in \npersons in all regions. \n20. We reaffirm the central role of the work of the United Nations Office on Drugs \nand Crime in the global fight against trafficking in persons, particularly in providing \ntechnical assistance to Member States, upon their request, to implement the United \nNations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to \nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \nChildren, by making use of existing capacity-building tools, lessons learned from \nMember States and expertise available in other international organizations. \n21. We will endeavour to provide unearmarked extrabudgetary resources for the \noffices of the United Nations system which are mandated to combat trafficking in \npersons, consistent with their rules and procedures. \n22. We reiterate the need for improved data collection and analysis of trafficking in \npersons, disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant factors, including the form of \nexploitation, and using systematic and consistent criteria, to effectively counter \ntrafficking in persons. We thus recognize the importance of improved data collection \nby national authorities and will enhance international cooperation to this end, \nincluding through capacity-building, financial support and technical assistance. We \nwill do so consistent with our national legislation on data protection, if applicable, \nand our respective international obligations related to privacy. \n23. We acknowledge the importance of the biennial Global Report on Trafficking in \nPersons, prepared by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime pursuant to the \nGlobal Plan of Action, and request the Office to continue to collect information on \npatterns, forms and flows of trafficking in persons, at the national, regional and \ninternational levels, in a balanced, reliable and comprehensive manner, to be \npublished in the Global Report, and in ongoing research to estimate the prevalence of \ntrafficking in persons, in close cooperation and collaboration with Member States. \n24. We evince our strong political will and commitment of financial resources to \neffectively address trafficking in persons in all circumstances, including in situations \nof armed conflict, natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies, while fully \nrespecting the humanitarian principles for humanitarian action. In this regard:  \n \n(a) \nWe recognize that refugees and migrants in large movements face greater \nrisk of trafficking in persons, including forced labour. We will work to prevent \ntrafficking among those affected by displacement, and provide support for victims, \nincluding through targeted measures to identify victims or those at risk of trafficking \nin places of first arrival as well as throughout their journey. We reiterate our \ncommitment to take steps to address the particular situations of vulnerability of \nwomen and children during the journey from point of origin to place of arrival, \nincluding their potential exposure to trafficking in persons, including through the \ndevelopment of age- and gender-responsive policies and programmes; \n \n(b) \nWe commit to intensify our efforts to prevent irregular migration and \ncreate and strengthen pathways for safe, orderly and regular migration to reduce the \nexposure of people on the move to trafficking in persons, and in this regard recall our \nrespective commitments to the Global Compact for Safe Orderly and Regular \nMigration, including discretionary measures such as access to residence or work \npermits, humanitarian visas, family reunification and private sponsorship, as \napplicable; \n \n(c) \nWe encourage the training of humanitarian and peacekeeping personnel to \nbe deployed in humanitarian emergencies and peacekeeping operations on responding \nto trafficking in persons and on gender expertise, child protection and sexual \n\n2021 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the \nUnited Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \nin Persons \nA/RES/76/7A/RES/76/7\n \n7/8\n21-17189 \n \nexploitation and abuse. We encourage relevant entities and bodies of the United \nNations system to train their personnel and to build their technical capacity to assess \nsituations and respond to instances of trafficking in persons in armed conflict and \nhumanitarian emergencies, and to work together to identify, prevent and respond \neffectively to victims.  \n25. We express our deep concern about the increasing links between armed groups, \nincluding terrorist groups, and trafficking in persons, involving the coercion of \nvictims, in particular women and girls, into forced marriages, sexual slavery, forced \npregnancy, forced labour, domestic servitude and sexual exploitation, and subjecting \nmen and boys to forced labour or act as combatants.  \n26. We note with concern the increasing misuse of information and communications \ntechnologies, in particular the Internet, to facilitate various aspects of trafficking in \npersons, including advertising, grooming, recruitment, control, financial transactions \nand various forms of exploitation, including online child sexual exploitation and the \nproduction and distribution of child pornography and other child sexual abuse \nmaterial. We also emphasize the importance of countering such misuse while \nrespecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with our \nobligations under international law. In this regard:  \n \n(a) \nWe call for the strengthening of law enforcement digital expertise and \ncapacity to conduct proportionate, lawful, accountable and necessary investigations \nin cyberspace, including the dark web, and seize associated electronic evidence. We \nencourage the appropriate use by law enforcement of technology-based solutions that \naddress the global scope of trafficking in persons; \n \n(b) \nWe further encourage the appropriate use of technology and innovative \ntools by practitioners and central authorities to increase international and cross-border \ncooperation in criminal matters. We recognize the need for ethical use of technology \nby law enforcement, consistent with human rights obligations; \n \n(c) \nWe call for effective partnerships among the public sector, civil society, \nacademia and the private sector, including technology companies, to enhance \ninnovation, cooperation and the use of technology to combat trafficking in persons.  \n27. We recognize the need for a multidisciplinary approach, based on respect for all \nhuman rights, to combating trafficking in human organs and trafficking in persons for \nthe purpose of organ removal. We reaffirm our commitment to prevent and combat \ntrafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal. We condemn the involvement \nof criminal groups and unethical medical personnel in trafficking in persons for the \npurpose of organ removal. We commit to adopting ethical and transparent regulations \ngoverning organ donations, strengthening legislative frameworks, including by \nreviewing, developing or amending them, as appropriate, to prevent and combat \ntrafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal and trafficking in human \norgans, including the criminalization of these practices and provisions to ensure the \naccountability of the perpetrators, and to resource such efforts, including the ready \nprovision of effective and needs-based victim protection and health services. We call \nfor better coordination and collaboration between criminal justice actors and medical \nprofessionals, and strengthened capacity and skills to proactively identify and \ninvestigate these cases.  \n28. We reaffirm the importance of taking measures to prevent and combat \ntrafficking in persons in supply chains, including deterring and penalizing fraudulent \nand abusive recruitment practices. We encourage Member States, multilateral \norganizations and the private sector to adopt ethical and transparent practices in their \nprocurement and supply chains, and strongly urge them to regularly disclose and \nprovide further access to relevant information on these practices. We are mindful of \n\nA/RES/76/7 \n2021 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the \nUnited Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \nin Persons\n \n21-17189\n8/8 \n \nthe need to ensure that all actors in global supply chains, including intermediaries, \nwho purchase or benefit from the labour of trafficking victims, are to be held \naccountable, including through sufficiently stringent sanctions, through adoption and \nenforcement of appropriate legislation and practices. In this regard, we recall the \nUnited Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 12  We also \nemphasize the need to establish firewalls between immigration checks and labour \ninspections, and/or to ensure that labour inspections are conducted in such a way that \ndoes not put potential victims of trafficking in fear of immigration authorities or \noffences. We stress the importance in implementing labour standards improving \ngovernment procurement practices in efforts to promote decent work and the need to \ndevelop awareness-raising and educational programmes in partnership with civil \nsociety and the media to counter any acceptance of the use of forced labour and \nexploitation in the production of goods. We also urge the Secretary-General to ensure \nthat all United Nations procurement does not contain goods and services produced by \ntrafficked persons. \n29. We acknowledge that the gaps between the Global Plan of Action and its \nimplementation by Member States should be closed, and recognize that arrangements \nare needed to ensure the systematic follow-up to and review of all of the commitments \nwe are making at the present high-level meeting, including in the quadrennial high-\nlevel meetings of the General Assembly to appraise progress achieved in the \nimplementation of the Global Plan of Action. We will also promote the development \nof clearer analysis of successful counter-trafficking responses, and assessment and \nevaluation frameworks that include consideration of how laws, policies or practical \nmeasures affect victims of trafficking in persons. \n \n__________________ \n \n12  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations \u201cProtect, \nRespect and Remedy\u201d Framework (A/HRC/17/31, annex). \n",

We commit to enhancing the capacity of law enforcement and criminal justice systems to identify, investigate and prosecute cases of trafficking in persons, and analyse financial flows to detect those criminal networks in collaboration with financial institutions. We also commit to developing and strengthening national referral mechanisms and to use available technology to sustain victim referrals and services and to identify, seize and forfeit ill-gotten gains of those criminal networks. We further commit to strengthening the capacity of criminal justice practitioners, including law enforcement officials, prosecutors, judges and correction and probation officers, and to enable a victim-centred, age- and gender-sensitive approach to care and assistance of victims, that takes into consideration disability and trauma and that addresses the specific needs of women, youth and children.",
