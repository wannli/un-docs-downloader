environmental and economic \nimperative for all humankind and an indispensable requirement for sustainable \ndevelopment, particularly in Africa, in the least developed countries, in landlocked \ndeveloping countries, in small island developing States and in some middle-income \ncountries, as well as countries in conflict and post-conflict situations, and underlining \nthe importance of

adverse impacts of \nclimate change, food loss and waste and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic, among other factors, have exacerbated the food insecurity situation in many \nparts of the world, with those in vulnerable situations, including women, girls, youth, \nIndigenous Peoples and local communities, older persons, persons with disabilities, \nrefugees, internally displaced persons and migrants being specially affected, \n \nRecognizing that trade and development can contribute to the eradication of \npoverty and that the United Nations Conference on Trade and

girls and the \neradication of poverty,  \n \nConcerned that the global economy is still facing difficult macroeconomic \nconditions and that, in recent years, poverty reduction has continued to stagnate in \ndeveloping countries, owing to, inter alia, the global economic slowdown, conflicts \nand the vulnerability of States to climate change and disasters, noting the heightened

momentum generated by the implementation of the \nSecond Decade towards poverty eradication and ensuring that markets work better \nfor people living in poverty,  \n \nReaffirming that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, \nthat its adverse impacts undermine the ability of all countries to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment, that increases in global temperature, sea level rise, ocean acidification, \nbiodiversity loss and other climate change impacts are seriously affecting coastal \nareas and low-lying coastal countries, including many of the least developed countries \nand small island developing States, and that the survival of many societies and of the \nbiological support systems of the planet is at risk, which further threatens food \nsecurity and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and \nthus requires urgent action to maintain, preserve and sustain the development gains \nachieved in the past decades,  \n \nUrging all countries that have not yet done so to ratify and accede to the United \nNations Convention against Corruption, 13  encouraging Parties to review its \nimplementation, committing to making the

the empowerment of the poor and people in vulnerable situations, \nincluding women, children and youth, Indigenous Peoples and local communities, \nolder persons, persons with disabilities, migrants, refugees and internally displaced \npersons and all low-income families,  \n \nRecognizing also that respecting the right to the enjoyment of the highest \nattainable standard of physical and mental health and building equitable national \nhealth systems can contribute to the eradication of poverty, and in this regard recalling \nthe organization of the 2022 high-level meeting of the General Assembly on \nimproving global road safety, the 2023 high-level meetings of the Assembly on \npandemic prevention, preparedness and response, on universal health coverage and \non the fight against

the importance of joining global efforts to address the \ncommon challenges of food security, nutrition and social development,  \n \nRecognizing also the centrality of mobilizing financial and non-financial \nresources for development at the national and international levels and the effective \nuse of those resources, as well as the importance of policy coherence and a \ncoordinated approach that involves participation at all levels by all actors to promote \nan enabling environment for sustainable development, and of reinvigorating the \nglobal partnership for sustainable development in support of the achievement of the \ninternationally agreed development goals, in particular the 2030 Agenda, which \nbuilds upon the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals, \n \nUnderscoring that, for all countries, public policies and the mobilization and \neffective use of domestic resources, underscored by the principle of national \nownership, are central to the common pursuit of sustainable development, including \nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals, recognizing that domestic resources \nare first and foremost generated by economic growth,

\nUnderlining the priority and urgency given by Heads of State and Government \nto the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme \npoverty, as expressed in the outcomes

poverty at the middle-income country standard, this number \ncontinues to be significant and unacceptably high, the levels of inequality in income, \nwealth and opportunities remain high or are

and combating inequality within and between countries and \nsocial exclusion, especially of the furthest behind;  \n \n10. \nRecognizes that poverty reduction also requires increasing productive \ncapacity sustainably, and in this regard recalls the 2030 Agenda, and recognizes the \ncontribution that economic growth and structural transformation through, inter alia, \nincreased productivity and a healthy and well-educated workforce can make in reducing \npoverty in developing countries, and in this regard recognizes the importance of \nstrengthening cooperation, including by considering increasing the allocation of the \nnecessary means of implementation, such as financing, technology transfers on mutually \nagreed terms and capacity-building, so as to, inter alia, accelerate inclusive and \nsustainable industrialization and digital transformation and expand the production of \nvaccines, medical equipment and agricultural and industrial goods and strengthen the \nservices sector, with a view to achieving greater economic diversification and \ntechnological development and innovation, while promoting inclusive labour markets, as \nwell as decent job creation and prosperity, and generating fiscal resources for the \nimplementation and promotion of inclusive economic public policies to combat \ninequalities and eradicate poverty, in particular extreme poverty,

Welcomes the contributions of South-South cooperation to poverty \neradication and sustainable development, in this regard recalls the second High-level \nUnited Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation, held in Buenos Aires from \n20 to 22 March 2019, and its outcome document, 18  reaffirms that South-South \ncooperation is an important element of international cooperation for development as a \ncomplement to, not a substitute for, North-South cooperation, recognizes that South-\nSouth and triangular cooperation contribute to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda \nand to achieving the overarching goal of eradication of poverty in all its forms and \ndimensions, and commits to strengthening South-South and triangular cooperation as a \nmeans of bringing relevant experience and expertise to bear in development cooperation;  \n \n14. Emphasizes the importance of the outcome of the Second United Nations \nDecade for the Eradication of Poverty of promoting and supporting the integration of \ndecent work and poverty eradication into national and international policies, \nstrategies and programmes, with a particular focus on those who risk being left \nbehind, by, inter alia, implementing measures to formalize employment, consider \nintroducing or strengthening minimum wages, guarantee respect for freedom of \nassociation and collective bargaining rights, combat all forms of discrimination in \nemployment and end child and forced labour, including in agriculture and rural areas;  \n \n15.
