Promotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament \nand non-proliferation \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nDetermined to foster strict respect for the purposes and principles enshrined in \nthe Charter of the United Nations, \n \nRecalling its resolution 56/24 T of 29 November 2001 on multilateral \ncooperation in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation and global efforts \nagainst terrorism and other relevant resolutions, as well as its resolutions 57/63 of \n22 November 2002, 58/44 of 8 December 2003, 59/69 of 3 December 2004, 60/59 of \n8 December 2005, 61/62 of 6

and non-proliferation, \n \nRecalling also the purpose of the United Nations to maintain international peace \nand security and, to that end, to take effective collective measures for the prevention \nand removal of threats to the peace and for the suppression of acts of aggression or \nother breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity \nwith the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of \ninternational disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace, as \nenshrined in the Charter, \n\nA/RES/74/55 \nPromotion of multilateralism in the area \nof disarmament and non-proliferation\n \n19-21844\n2/3 \n \n \nRecalling further the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 in which it is \nstated, inter alia, that the responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social \ndevelopment, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared \namong the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally and that, as the \nmost universal and most representative organization in the world, the United Nations \nmust play the central role, \n \nConvinced that, in the globalization era and with the information revolution, \narms regulation, non-proliferation and disarmament problems are more than ever the \nconcern of all countries in the world, which are affected in one way or another by \nthese problems and therefore should have the possibility to participate in the \nnegotiations that arise to tackle them, \n \nBearing in mind the existence of a broad structure of disarmament and arms \nregulation agreements resulting from non-discriminatory and transparent multilateral \nnegotiations with the participation of a large number of countries, regardless of their \nsize and power, \n \nAware of the need to advance further in the field of arms regulation, \nnon-proliferation and disarmament on the basis of universal, multilateral, \nnon-discriminatory and transparent negotiations with the goal of reaching general and \ncomplete disarmament under strict international control, \n \nRecognizing the complementarity of bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral \nnegotiations on disarmament, \n \nRecognizing also that the proliferation and development of weapons of mass \ndestruction, including nuclear weapons, are among the most immediate threats to \ninternational peace and security which need to be dealt with, with the highest priority, \n \nConsidering that the multilateral disarmament agreements provide the \nmechanism for States parties to consult one another and to cooperate in solving any \nproblems which may arise in relation to the objective of, or in the application of, the \nprovisions of the agreements and that such consultations and cooperation may also be \nundertaken through appropriate international procedures within the framework of the \nUnited Nations and in accordance with the Charter, \n \nStressing that international cooperation, the peaceful settlement of disputes, \ndialogue and confidence-building measures would make an essential contribution to \nthe creation of multilateral and bilateral friendly relations among peoples and nations, \n \nBeing gravely concerned at the continuous and progressive erosion of \nmultilateralism in the field of arms regulation, non-proliferation and disarmament, \nand recognizing that the abrogation of major instruments of the arms control and \nnon-proliferation architecture as a result of unilateral actions by Member States in \nresolving their security concerns would jeopardize international peace and security \nand undermine confidence in the international security system as well as the \nfoundations of the United Nations itself, \n \nNoting that the Eighteenth Midterm Ministerial Meeting of the Movement of \nNon-Aligned Countries, held in Baku from 3 to 6 April 2018, welcomed the adoption \nof resolution 72/48 on the promotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament \nand non-proliferation and underlined the fact that multilateralism and multilaterally \nagreed solutions, in accordance with the Charter, provide the only sustainable method \nof addressing disarmament and international security issues, \n__________________ \n \n1  Resolution 55/2. \n\nPromotion of multilateralism in the area \nof disarmament and
