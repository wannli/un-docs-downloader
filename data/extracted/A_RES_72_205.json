continue to be highly vulnerable to price fluctuations, and recognizing the \nneed to continue efforts to diversify economies, as well as to improve the regulation, \nwhere appropriate, and the efficiency, responsiveness, functioning and transparency \nof financial and commodity markets nationally, regionally and internationally in order \nto address excessive commodity price volatility,  \n \nExpressing concern that the global economy has yet to recover completely and \nremains in a challenging phase, notwithstanding the recent cyclical pickup in global \neconomic activity, that growth remains weak in many countries and includes subdued \ntrade growth, volatile capital flows, widespread fiscal strains and unsustainable debt \nin some countries, particularly developing countries, and that commodity exporters \nare particularly hard hit owing to their continued adjustment to a sharp step-down in \nforeign earnings, recognizing that, while short-term risks are broadly balanced, \nmedium-term risks are still tilted to the downside, and in this regard stressing the need \nfor continuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances, to reform and \nstrengthen the international financial system and to make further progress towards \nsustaining and rebalancing global demand,  \n \nRecognizing the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities, \nespecially on women, girls and young people,  \n \nRecognizing also that the structural constraints that women face as economic \nagents, including segmentation in low-value-added or subsistence-oriented work, \nunequal access to productive resources, limited access to training and skill-building \ndue to gender segmentation in education and labour markets and a lack of resources, \nas well as the heavy burden of unpaid work, make women and girls especially \nvulnerable to the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities,  \n \nRecognizing further that many developing countries continue to be highly \ndependent on primary commodities as their principal source of export revenues, \nemployment, income generation and domestic savings and require additional sources \nof growth to become the driving force of investment, economic growth and social \ndevelopment, including poverty eradication, recognizing also the challenges and \nspecial needs of those countries, and stressing the critical importance of sustainable \nand inclusive industrial development for developing countries as a critical source of \neconomic growth, economic diversification and value addition,  \n \nRecognizing that uncertainty in global commodity markets reinforces the need \nto comprehensively deal with the commodity problematique, inter alia, the demand \nfor commodities, supply capacities, commodity revenues and investments in \ncommodity-dependent economies, while taking due account of the diversity of each \ncountry\u2019s individual situation and needs and the promotion of their sustainable \ndevelopment, and to strengthen the nexus between, inter alia, trade, finance, \ninvestment in sustainable agriculture and food systems, energy and industrialization,  \n \nNoting the work on consensus-building on commodity-related issues achieved \nthrough meetings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \nincluding the multi-year expert meetings on commodities and development, the \nGlobal Commodities Forum and the African Oil, Gas and Mines Trade and Finance \nConference and Exhibition,  \n \nRecognizing the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities on \nboth producer and consumer countries, particularly commodity-dependent developing \ncountries,  \n \nNoting the recent and marked reversal in commodity prices and that commodity \nnet export economies may need to adjust to a possibly protracted period of lower \nexport and fiscal revenues,  \n\nCommodities \nA/RES/72/205\n \n5/8 \n17-23270 \n \n \nNoting also the volatility and unpredictability of commodity prices, which have \nthreatened, inter alia, the food security of net importers in the recent past, and noting \nfurther that the continuation of this long-term uncertainty and volatility, intensified \nby recent trends in commodity prices, can have an impact on the capacities of many \ndeveloping countries, particularly commodity-dependent countries, to continue to \nimplement policies for achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication,  \n \nStressing the importance of policies to address longer-term structural issues, \nincluding structural constraints faced by women as economic agents, to diversify \ncommodity economies and to integrate commodity policies into wider development \nand poverty eradication strategies at all levels,  \n \nNoting all relevant voluntary initiatives aimed at improving transparency in \ncommodity markets and mitigating the impact of excessive price volatility,  \n \nUnderlining the importance of timely, accurate and transparent information in \nhelping to address excessive food price volatility, noting global and regional \ninitiatives, including the Agricultural Market Information System and its Rapid \nResponse Forum, the joint organization data initiative and other regional data \nplatforms and programmes, and urging the participating international organizations, \nprivate sector actors and Governments to ensure the public dissemination of timely \nand quality food market information products,  \n \nExpressing deep concern at the adverse impact of climate change and extreme \nweather patterns on access to, and the utilization and prices of, agricultural \ncommodities,  \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General on world commodity \ntrends and prospects;16  \n \n2. \nRecognizes the interlinkage between the adequate and transparent \nfunctioning of commodity markets and the capacity of some commodity-dependent \ndeveloping countries to collect appropriate fiscal revenues from commodity exports \nand mobilize domestic sources to support their sustainable development, mainly \nthrough sustainable and inclusive economic growth, industrialization, decent work \nand market diversification;  \n \n3. \nEncourages support for developing countries, according to their national \nplans and policies, through technical assistance, to increase their capacity in detecting \nand averting trade mispricing in their commodities sectors in order to enhance their \nbenefits from those sectors to support sustainable growth and development;  \n \n4. \nReiterates the need for further efforts to address excessive commodity \nprice volatility, in particular by assisting producers, especially small-scale producers, \nincluding women, in accordance with national plans and policies, in managing risk; \n \n5. \nCalls upon the international community to support the efforts of \ncommodity-dependent developing countries to address the factors that create \nstructural barriers to international trade and impede, inter alia, diversification, \nincluding tariff and non-tariff barriers, limited access to financial services resulting \nin scarce resources for investing in the commodity sector, weak infrastructure, \nparticularly regarding both the cost and availability of transportation and storage, and \nlack of skills in producing and marketing alternative products;  \n \n6. \nLooks forward to the convening of the Eleventh Ministerial Conference of \nthe World Trade Organization in Buenos Aires

\neconomic and financial crisis of 2008, despite the recent strengthening of global \neconomic activity, since growth remains weak in many countries and agricultural and \nother commodity prices remain depressed while inequalities are rising, and \nacknowledges that international trade can play a role in achieving sustainable, robust \nand balanced growth for all;  \n \n8. \nCalls for a coherent set of policy actions at the national, regional and \ninternational levels to address excessive price volatility and support commodity-\ndependent developing countries in mitigating negative impacts, in particular by \nfacilitating value addition and enhancing their participation in commodity and related \nproduct value chains, by supporting large-scale diversification of these economies \nand by encouraging the use and further development of market-oriented risk \nmanagement tools, instruments and strategies;  \n \n9. \nStresses the importance of developing and strengthening agricultural \npolicies and strategies that recognize and address women\u2019s critical role in food \nsecurity and improved nutrition outcomes as an integral part of both short- and long-\nterm

Recognizes the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the \nResponsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of \nNational Food Security17 by the Committee on World Food Security in 2012;  \n \n13. Also recognizes the endorsement of the Principles for Responsible \nInvestment in Agriculture and Food Systems18 by the Committee on World Food \nSecurity in 2014;  \n \n14. Stresses that technical assistance and capacity-building aimed at \nimproving the commodity export competitiveness of producers are particularly \nimportant for developing countries, especially in Africa, and invites Member States \nand all relevant stakeholders to provide the necessary resources for commodity-\nspecific financial and technical assistance, in particular for human and institutional \ncapacity-building, including gender-responsive measures, as well as quality, reliable, \nsustainable and resilient infrastructure development of developing countries, with a \nview to reducing their institutional bottlenecks and transaction costs and enhancing \ntheir commodity trade and development in accordance with national development \nplans;  \n__________________ \n \n17  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document CL 144/9 (C 2013/20), \nappendix D. \n \n18  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document C 2015/20, appendix D. \n\nCommodities \nA/RES/72/205\n \n7/8 \n17-23270 \n \n \n15.

Recalls the agreement to keep under regular review, by the Ministerial \nConference and appropriate organs of the World Trade Organization, the impact of \nthe results of the Uruguay Round on the least developed countries as well as on the \nnet food-importing developing countries, with a view to fostering positive measures \nto enable them to achieve their development objectives, and in this regard calls for \nthe implementation of the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning \nthe Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net \nFood-Importing Developing Countries;  \n \n17. Encourages developed countries that have not already done so and \ndeveloping countries declaring themselves in a position to do so to take steps towards \nthe goal of realizing timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access \non a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with the Hong Kong \nMinisterial Declaration adopted by the World Trade Organization in 2005;  \n \n18.
