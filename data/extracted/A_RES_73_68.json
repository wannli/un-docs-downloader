Ethical imperatives for a nuclear-weapon-free world  \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly,  \n \nRecalling its resolution 70/50 of 7 December 2015, adopted on the occasion of \nthe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, which was established to save \nsucceeding generations from the untold suffering of the scourge of war, and its \nresolution 72/37 of 4 December 2017,  \n \nRecalling also that the United Nations emerged at the time of the immense trail \nof death and destruction resulting from the Second World War, 73 years ago,  \n \nRecalling further the noble principles of the Charter of the United Nations, \nwhich enjoin the international community, individually and collectively, to spare no \neffort in promoting the ethical imperative of \u201cin larger freedom\u201d, so that all peoples \nmay enjoy freedom from want, freedom from fear and the freedom to live in dignity,  \n \nConvinced that, given the catastrophic humanitarian consequences and risks \nassociated with a nuclear weapon detonation, Member States have long envisaged \nnuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation as urgent and interlinked ethical \nimperatives in achieving the objectives of the Charter, which is reflected in the first \nresolution, resolution 1 (I), adopted by the General Assembly on 24 January 1946, \naimed at the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other \nmajor weapons adaptable to mass destruction,  \n \nAcknowledging, in this connection, the ethical imperatives outlined in the \nprovisions of its resolutions and reports and those of other related international \ninitiatives on the catastrophic humanitarian consequences and risks posed by a \nnuclear weapon detonation, including the declaration that the use of nuclear weapons \nwould cause indiscriminate suffering and as such is a violation of the Charter and the \nlaws of humanity and international law,1 the condemnation of nuclear war as contrary \n__________________ \n \n1  See resolution 1653 (XVI).  \n\nA/RES/73/68 \nEthical imperatives for a nuclear-weapon-free world\n \n18-21277\n2/3 \n \nto human conscience and a violation of the fundamental right to life,2 the threat to the \nvery survival of humankind posed by the existence of nuclear weapons, 3  the \ndetrimental environmental effects of the use of nuclear weapons, 4 and the disquiet \nthat was expressed at the continued spending on the development and maintenance of \nnuclear arsenals,5  \n \nAcknowledging also the preamble to and article VI of the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons6 and the advisory opinion of the International \nCourt of Justice on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons, 7 in which the \nCourt unanimously concluded that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith \nand bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its \naspects under strict and effective international control,  \n \nAcknowledging further the United Nations Millennium Declaration,8 in which \nHeads of State and Government resolved to strive for the elimination of weapons of \nmass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, and to keep all options open for \nachieving that aim, including the possibility of convening an international conference \nto identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers,  \n \nConcerned that, despite the long-standing recognition that it has accorded to \nthese ethical imperatives and while much effort has been directed to addressing \nnuclear non-proliferation, limited progress has been made in meeting the nuclear \ndisarmament obligations required to achieve and maintain the nuclear-weapon-free \nworld that the international community demands,  \n \nDisappointed at the continued absence of progress towards multilateral \nnegotiations on nuclear disarmament in the Conference on Disarmament, despite \nunrelenting efforts of Member States towards this end,  \n \nNoting with satisfaction the increasing awareness, renewed attention and \ngrowing momentum that has been generated by Member States and the international \ncommunity since 2010 regarding the catastrophic humanitarian consequences and \nrisks associated with nuclear weapons, which underpin the ethical imperatives for \nnuclear disarmament and the urgency of achieving and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-\nfree world, together with all related international initiatives,  \n \nRecalling the adoption on 7 July 2017 of the Treaty on the Prohibition of \nNuclear Weapons, 9 in which the ethical imperatives for nuclear disarmament are \nacknowledged,  \n \nConscious of the absolute validity of multilateral diplomacy in relation to \nnuclear disarmament, and determined to promote multilateralism as essential to \nnuclear disarmament negotiations,  \n \n1. \nCalls upon all States to acknowledge the catastrophic humanitarian \nconsequences and risks posed by a nuclear weapon detonation, whether by accident, \nmiscalculation or design;  \n \n2. \nAcknowledges the ethical imperatives for nuclear disarmament and the \nurgency of achieving and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-free world, which is a \u201cglobal \npublic good of the highest order\u201d, serving both national and collective security interests;
