measures that are not in \naccordance with international law and the Charter and that endanger food security and \nnutrition, \n \nExpressing appreciation for the work of the United Nations system, in particular \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Food \nProgramme and the International Fund for Agricultural Development, aimed at ending \nhunger and achieving food security and improved nutrition, and recognizing their \nwork in supporting the efforts of Member States to achieve the full realization of the \nright to food, including through their provision of technical assistance to developing \ncountries in support of the implementation of national priority frameworks, \n \nRecognizing the role of the Committee on World Food Security as an important \nand inclusive international and intergovernmental platform for a broad range of \ncommitted stakeholders to work together in a coordinated manner and in support of \ncountry-led processes towards the elimination of hunger and ensuring food security \nand nutrition for all human beings,  \n \nConvinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources \nand capacities to

Declaration on Nutrition and the \nFramework for Action,14 and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and \ninternationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food \nsecurity and nutrition in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and \neconomies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, \n \nRecognizing that, despite the efforts made and the fact that some positive results \nhave been achieved, the problems of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a \nglobal dimension, that there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger and \nmalnutrition in all its forms and that these problems are increasing dramatically in \nsome regions in the absence of urgent, determined and concerted action, \n \nRecognizing also the importance of modern and traditional sustainable \nagricultural practices, including traditional seed supply systems, as well as access to \ncredit and other financial services, markets, secure land tenure, healthcare, social \nservices, education, training, knowledge and appropriate and affordable technologies, \nincluding efficient irrigation, the reuse of treated wastewater and water harvesting \nand storage for Indigenous Peoples and others living in rural areas, \n \nRecognizing further the complex character of food insecurity and its likely

small island developing States, and the need for coherence and \ncollaboration between international institutions at the global level, \n \nNoting with great concern that millions of people are facing famine or the \nimmediate risk of famine or are experiencing severe food insecurity in several regions \nof the world, and noting also that poverty, armed conflicts, drought and the volatility \nof commodity prices are among the factors causing or exacerbating famine and severe \nfood insecurity and that additional efforts, including international support, to respond, \nprevent and prepare for increasing global food insecurity are urgently needed, \n \nNoting the negative impact of the rise in international food commodity prices, \nfurther affecting people in vulnerable situations,  \n \nNoting also the rise in energy and fuel prices, which has had an impact on the \nincrease in food commodity prices, and noting further the rise in fertilizer prices and \nthe shortages caused by supply chain disruptions, affecting crop yields and \nthreatening future agricultural productivity and production, especially of wheat, \nmaize, millet, rice, sunflower oil and other essential foodstuffs,  \n \nRecalling its resolution 76/264 of 23 May 2022, entitled \u201cState of global food \ninsecurity\u201d, in which the General Assembly welcomed the initiative by the Secretary-\nGeneral to establish a Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, \nwith a Steering Committee chaired by the Deputy Secretary-General, while also \ntaking note of other relevant initiatives, such as the Global Alliance against Hunger \nand Poverty, aimed at promoting food security and improved nutrition, including for \nthose in vulnerable situations,  \n \nRecognizing the negative global impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID\u201119) \npandemic, and recognizing also that full recovery from the pandemic requires unity, \nsolidarity and multilateral cooperation, while recalling that the poorest and those who \nmay be vulnerable or in vulnerable situations have been the hardest hit by the \npandemic and that the impact of the crisis has reversed hard-won development gains \nand the fulfilment of the right to food for all, and hampered progress towards \nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 2, which aims to end \nhunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable \nagriculture, \n \nExpressing its deep concern over the negative effects of armed conflicts on the \nfulfilment of the right to food,  \n \nRecognizing that armed conflict impacts on food security can be direct, such as \ndisplacement from land, livestock grazing areas and fishing grounds or destruction of \nfood stocks and agricultural assets, or indirect, such as disruptions to food systems \nand markets, leading to increased food prices or decreased household purchasing \npower, or decreased access to supplies that are necessary for food preparation, \nincluding water and fuel, \n \nStressing the obligation of all States and parties to an armed conflict to protect \ncivilians, in accordance with international humanitarian law, and calling upon \nMember States, the United Nations and other relevant organizations to take further \nsteps to provide a coordinated emergency response to the food and nutrition needs of \naffected populations, while aiming to ensure that such steps are supportive of national \nstrategies and programmes aimed at improving food security and nutrition, \n \nReaffirming that starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is prohibited \nunder international humanitarian law and that it is therefore prohibited to attack, \ndestroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable to the \nsurvival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the \n\nThe right to food \nA/RES/80/210\n \n5/13\n25-20966 \n \nproduction of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies \nand irrigation works, \n \nStrongly condemning the unlawful denial of humanitarian access and depriving \ncivilians of objects indispensable to their survival, including wilfully impeding relief \nsupplies and access for responses to conflict-induced food insecurity in situations of \narmed conflict, which may constitute a violation of international humanitarian law, \n \nResolved to act to ensure that the respect, promotion, protection and fulfilment \nof all human rights and the human rights perspective are taken into account at the \nnational, regional and international levels in measures to address the realization of the \nright to food,  \n \nRecognizing that trade, along with domestic production, plays a vital role in \nimproving global food security in all its dimensions and enhancing nutrition, and in \nthis regard urging Member States to ensure that trade and trade-related measures are \nconsistent with World Trade Organization rules and exceptions, \n \nStressing that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural \ndevelopment is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in \ndeveloping countries, through, inter alia, the promotion of investments in appropriate \nsmall-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce \nvulnerability to droughts and tackle water scarcity, as well as in programmes, \npractices and policies to scale up sustainable agroecological practices, \n \nRecognizing the importance of sustainable food systems that are fit to meet \nenvironmental, economic and social challenges, in order to guarantee food security \nand nutrition for all, \n \nRecognizing also the importance of school meal programmes to ensure better \neducation, health and nutrition outcomes for children, while considering available \nresources, \n \nExpressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, \ndiseases and pest infestations, as well as the negative impact of climate change, and \ntheir increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in substantial loss of life \nand livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security and nutrition, \nin particular in developing countries, \n \nConcerned that the adverse impacts of climate change and natural disasters are \nharming agricultural productivity, food production and cropping patterns, thus \ncontributing to food availability shortfalls, and that such impacts are expected to \nincrease with future climate change, \n \nEmphasizing that a multisectoral approach that integrates nutrition across all \nsectors, including agriculture, health, water and sanitation, social protection and \neducation, as well as a gender perspective, is critical to achieving global food security \nand improved nutrition and the realization of the right to food, \nRecalling the endorsement by the Committee on World Food

66/288 of 27 July 2012, \n \nRecalling also the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u2013203020 \nand its guiding principles, which, inter alia, recognize the importance of promoting \nregular disaster preparedness and response and recovery exercises, with a view to \nensuring rapid and effective response to disasters and related displacement, including \naccess to essential food and non\u2011food relief supplies, as appropriate to local needs, as \nwell as of fostering collaboration across global and regional mechanisms and \ninstitutions for the implementation and coherence of instruments and tools relevant to \ndisaster risk reduction, such as for climate change adaptation, biodiversity, \nsustainable development, poverty eradication, environment, agriculture, health, food \nand nutrition and others, as appropriate, \n \nRecalling further the proclamation at its seventieth session of 2016\u20132025 as the \nUnited Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition,21 and stressing the opportunity the \nDecade represents to bring together initiatives and efforts to eradicate hunger and \nprevent all forms of malnutrition, and in that regard, welcoming the decision to extend \nthe Decade to 2030, pursuant to its resolution 79/276 of 25 March 2025, to align it \nwith the 2030 Agenda, and to maintain the political momentum at the global, regional \nand national levels to ending malnutrition in all its forms by 2030, \n \nExpressing its support for the Secretary-General in his continuing efforts to \npromote food security and nutrition, including through continued engagement with \nMember States and the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, \n \n1. \nReaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human \ndignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional \nand international levels for its elimination; \n \n2. \nAlso reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient, \nnutritious and sustainably produced food, consistent with the right to adequate food \nand the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully \ndevelop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; \n \n3. \nExpresses its concern at the fact that the effects created by the world food \ncrisis still continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable \npeople, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by \nthe impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of \nthe crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially the least developed \ncountries; \n \n4. \nUnderlines that the pandemic has exacerbated existing high levels of acute \nfood insecurity, and calls upon Member States and other relevant stakeholders to \nconsider the fulfilment of the right to food as part of the recovery from the pandemic \nby, inter alia, keeping food and agriculture supply chains functioning, ensuring the \ncontinued trade in and movement of food and livestock, products and inputs essential \nfor agricultural and food production to markets, minimizing food loss and waste in \nthe whole supply chain, including families and households, supporting workers and \nfarmers, including women farmers, in agriculture and food supply chains to continue \ntheir essential work, including cross-border, in a safe manner, mobilizing and \nallocating adequate resources and enhancing institutional and training capacities for \nan accelerated implementation of sustainable agriculture and food systems, providing \ncontinued access to adequate, safe, affordable and nutritious food, and providing \n_______________ \n \n20 Resolution 69/283, annex II. \n \n21 See

prices on food insecurity and malnutrition; \n \n5. \nExpresses its deep concern that, according to the most recent estimates of \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund \nfor Agricultural Development, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the World Food \nProgramme and the World Health Organization, in 2024, between 638 and 720 million \npeople in the world, or 7.8 to 8.8 per cent of the global population, faced hunger, and \nan estimated 28.0 per cent of the global population, or 2.3 billion people, were \nmoderately or severely food insecure, which is still 335 million persons more than in \n2019, before the COVID\u201119 pandemic, and 683 million more compared with 2015, \nwhen the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted;  \n \n6. \nConsiders it alarming that, as estimated by the United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund, World Health Organization and World Bank inter-agency group on joint child \nmalnutrition estimates, in 2024, 150.2 million children under 5 years of age continued \nto suffer from stunting, 42.8 million from wasting and 35.5 million from overweight; \n \n7. \nExpresses its deep concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per \ncent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the world\u2019s \nhungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food \ninsecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that \nin many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and \npreventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many \nwomen as men suffer from malnutrition; \n \n8. \nEncourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security \nprogrammes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and \ndiscrimination against women, in particular when they contribute to the malnutrition \nof women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the \nright to food and that women have equal access to resources, including income, land \nand water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access \nto healthcare, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves \nand their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower all women and \nstrengthen their role in decision-making; \n \n9. \nEncourages the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue to \nmainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations \nbodies and mechanisms addressing the right to food and food insecurity and \nmalnutrition to continue to integrate a gender perspective into their relevant policies, \nprogrammes and activities; \n \n10. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and \nnutritious food are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities; \n \n11. \nStresses that the primary responsibility of States is to respect, promote, \nprotect and fulfil the right to food and that the international community should \nprovide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation \nin support of national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to \nincrease food production and access to food, including through agricultural \ndevelopment assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance \nand food aid, ensuring food security, with special attention to the specific needs of \nwomen, youth and girls, and promoting innovation, support for agricultural and other \ntraining related to food production, processing, preparation and handling and for the \ndevelopment of adapted technologies, research on rural advisory services and support \nfor access to financing services, and ensure support for the establishment of secure \nland tenure systems; \n\nThe right to food \nA/RES/80/210\n \n9/13\n25-20966 \n \n \n12. Calls upon all States and, if appropriate, relevant international \norganizations to take measures and support programmes that are aimed at combating \nundernutrition in mothers, in particular during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and in \nchildren, and the irreversible effects of chronic undernutrition in early childhood, in \nparticular from birth to the age of 2 years; \n \n13. Also calls upon all States and, where appropriate, relevant international \norganizations to implement policies and programmes to reduce and eliminate \npreventable mortality and morbidity, as a result of malnutrition, of children under 5 years \nof age, and in this regard urges States to disseminate the technical guidance prepared \nby the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in \ncollaboration with the World Health Organization,22 and to apply it, as appropriate, in \nthe design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring of laws, policies, programmes, \nbudgets and mechanisms for remedy and redress aimed at eliminating preventable \nmortality and morbidity of children under 5 years of age; \n \n14. Encourages all States to take steps, with a view to progressively achieving \nthe full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions for \neveryone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to \nfood, and to create and adopt national plans and legislation to combat hunger; \n \n15. Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in \ndeveloping countries and regions in connection with food security and the \ndevelopment of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food; \n \n16. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and responsible \npublic investment in rural development, taking into consideration the Principles for \nResponsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems, as endorsed by the \nCommittee on World Food Security, is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, \nin particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investment, \nincluding private investment, in appropriate small-scale irrigation, integrated water \nresource management and water management technologies in order to reduce \nvulnerability to droughts and to tackle water scarcity; \n \n17. Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the \nrealization of the right to food and to food security and the contribution of small-scale \nfishers to the local food security of coastal communities; \n \n18. Also recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, where \nnearly half a billion family farmers are located, and that these people are especially \nvulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm \nincomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing \nchallenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural \npolicies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and \ninsurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security \nand rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing \ncommunities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access for \ntheir products to national and international markets and empowerment of small \nproducers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and \nthe provision of the right to food; \n \n19. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through \nnational efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and \nland degradation and to mitigate the effects of drought and through investments and \n_______________ \n \n22 A/HRC/27/31; see also Human Rights Council resolution 33/11 (see Official Records of the \nGeneral Assembly, Seventy-first Session, Supplement No. 53A and corrigendum (A/71/53/Add.1 \nand A/71/53/Add.1/Corr.1), chap.
