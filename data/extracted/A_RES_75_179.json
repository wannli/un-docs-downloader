determined and concerted action, \n \nRecognizing also the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural \npractices, including traditional seed supply systems, as well as access to credit and \nother financial services, markets, secure land tenure, health care, social services, \neducation, training, knowledge and appropriate and affordable technologies, \nincluding efficient irrigation, the reuse of treated wastewater and water harvesting \nand storage for indigenous peoples and others living in rural areas, \n \nRecognizing further the complex character of food insecurity and its likely \nrecurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the \nglobal financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and \nthe adverse impacts of climate change, as well as poverty, natural disasters, armed \nconflicts, drought, volatility in commodity prices and the lack in many countries of \nthe appropriate technology, investment

and \ncollaboration between international institutions at the global level, \n \nNoting with great concern that millions of people are facing famine or the \nimmediate risk of famine or are experiencing severe food insecurity in several regions \nof the world, and noting also that poverty, armed conflicts, drought and the volatility \nof commodity prices are among the factors causing or exacerbating famine and severe \nfood insecurity and that additional efforts, including international support, to respond, \nprevent and prepare for increasing global food insecurity are urgently needed, \n \nNoting with great concern also the threat to human health, safety and well-being \ncaused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which continues to spread \nglobally, as well as

supportive of national \nstrategies and programmes aimed at improving food security and nutrition, \n \nReaffirming that starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited \nunder international humanitarian law and that it is therefore prohibited to attack, \ndestroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable to the \nsurvival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the \nproduction of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies \nand irrigation works, \n \nResolved to act to ensure that the

\n20-17320\n6/12 \n \n \nRecalling further the proclamation at its seventieth session of 2016\u20132025 as the \nUnited Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition, and stressing the opportunity the \nDecade represents to bring together initiatives and efforts to eradicate hunger and \nprevent all forms of malnutrition, \n \nAcknowledging the work done by the High-level Task Force on Global Food and \nNutrition Security established by the Secretary-General, and supporting the \nSecretary-General in his continuing efforts in this regard, including continued \nengagement with Member States and the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights \nCouncil on the right to food, \n \n1. \nReaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human \ndignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, \nregional and international levels for its elimination; \n \n2. \nAlso reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and \nnutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right \nof everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his \nor her physical and mental capacities; \n \n3. \nConsiders it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund, up to 45 per cent of the children who die every year before the age \nof 5 die from undernutrition and hunger-related illness, at least one in three children \nunder the age of 5 is undernourished or overweight and one in two suffers from hidden \nhunger, undermining the capacity of millions of children to grow and develop to their \nfull potential, and that, as estimated by the World Food Programme, if the current \ntrend continues, the number of hungry people worldwide will reach 840 million by \n2030, further compromising the achievement of the zero hunger target set out in the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; \n \n4. \nExpresses its concern at the fact that the effects created by the world food \ncrisis still continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable \npeople, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by \nthe impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of \nthe crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially the least developed \ncountries; \n \n5. \nExpresses particular concern at the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on \nthe fulfilment of all human rights for all, including the right to food, underlines that \nthe pandemic is exacerbating existing high levels of acute food insecurity, and calls \nupon Member States and other relevant stakeholders to consider the fulfilment of the \nright to food as part of the response to and recovery from the pandemic by, inter alia, \nkeeping food and agriculture supply chains functioning, ensuring the continued trade \nin and movement of food and livestock, products and inputs essential for agricultural \nand food production to markets, minimizing food loss and waste, supporting workers \nand farmers, including women farmers, in agriculture and food supply chains to \ncontinue their essential work, including cross-border, in a safe manner, mobilizing \nand allocating adequate resources and enhancing institutional capacities for an \naccelerated implementation of sustainable agriculture and food systems, providing \ncontinued access to adequate, safe, affordable and nutritious food, and providing \nadequate social safety nets and assistance to minimize the negative effects of loss of \nlivelihoods and increasing food prices on food insecurity and malnutrition; \n \n6. \nExpresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Security \nand Nutrition in the World 2019: Safeguarding against Economic Slowdowns and \nDownturns, the number of hungry people in the world is growing, the vast majority \n\nThe right to food \nA/RES/75/179\n \n7/12\n20-17320 \n \nof hungry people live in developing countries and 2 billion people in the world \nexperience moderate or severe food insecurity; \n \n7. \nAlso expresses its deep concern that, while women contribute more than \n50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the \nworld\u2019s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food \ninsecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that \nin many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and \npreventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many \nwomen as men suffer from malnutrition; \n \n8. \nEncourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security \nprogrammes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and \ndiscrimination against women, in particular when they contribute to the malnutrition \nof women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the \nright to food and that women have equal access to resources, including income, land \nand water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access \nto health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves \nand their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and \nstrengthen their role in decision-making; \n \n9. \nEncourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the \nright to food to continue to mainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his \nmandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to \nfood and food insecurity and malnutrition to continue to integrate a gender \nperspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities; \n \n10. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and \nnutritious food are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities; \n \n11. \nStresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect \nthe right to food and that the international community should provide, through a \ncoordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support of \nnational and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food \nproduction and access to food, including through agricultural development assistance, \nthe transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, ensuring \nfood security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, and \npromoting innovation, support for the development of adapted technologies, research \non rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and ensure \nsupport for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; \n \n12. Calls upon all States and, if appropriate, relevant international \norganizations to take measures and support programmes that are aimed at combating \nundernutrition in mothers, in particular during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and in \nchildren, and the irreversible effects of chronic undernutrition in early childhood, in \nparticular from birth to the age of 2 years; \n \n13. Also calls upon all States and, where appropriate, relevant international \norganizations to implement policies and programmes to reduce and eliminate \npreventable mortality and morbidity, as a result of malnutrition, of children under \n5 years of age, and in this regard urges States to disseminate the technical guidance \nprepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, \nin collaboration with the World Health Organization, 14 and to apply it, as appropriate, \n__________________ \n \n14 A/HRC/27/31; see also Human Rights Council resolution 33/11 (see Official Records of the \nGeneral Assembly, Seventy-first Session, Supplement No. 53A and corrigendum (A/71/53/Add.1 \nand A/71/53/Add.1/Corr.1), chap.

Encourages all States to take steps, with a view to progressively achieving \nthe full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions for \neveryone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to \nfood, and to create and adopt national plans to combat hunger; \n \n15. Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in \ndeveloping countries and regions in connection with food security and the \ndevelopment of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food; \n \n16. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and responsible \npublic investment in rural development, taking into consideration the Principles for \nResponsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems, as endorsed by the \nCommittee on World Food Security, is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, \nin particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investment, \nincluding private investment, in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water \nmanagement technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts and to tackle \nwater scarcity; \n \n17. Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the \nrealization of the right to food and to food security and the contribution of small-scale \nfishers to the local food security of coastal communities; \n \n18. Also recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, where \nnearly half a billion family farmers are located, and that these people are especially \nvulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm \nincomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing \nchallenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural \npolicies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and \ninsurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security \nand rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing \ncommunities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access for \ntheir products to national and international markets and empowerment of small \nproducers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and \nthe provision of the right to food; \n \n19. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through \nnational efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and \nland degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically \nappropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation \nof the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries \nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 15 \n \n20. Urges States that have not yet done so to favourably consider becoming \nparties to the Convention on Biological Diversity16 and to consider becoming parties \nto the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture 17 as \na matter of priority; \n \n21.

Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \nPeoples,18 acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of \nindigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the \nobstacles and challenges they face in achieving the full enjoyment of the right to food, \nand calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the \ndisproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples \nand the continuous discrimination against them; \n \n23. Also recalls the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of \nthe General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, held \non 22 and 23 September 2014,19 and the commitment to developing, in conjunction \nwith the indigenous peoples concerned and where appropriate, policies, programmes \nand resources to support indigenous peoples\u2019 occupations, traditional subsistence \nactivities, economies, livelihoods, food security and nutrition; \n \n24. Notes the need to further examine various concepts, such as \u201cfood \nsovereignty\u201d, and their relation to food security and the right to food, bearing in mind \nthe need to avoid any negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to food for all \npeople at all times; \n \n25. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international \norganizations, within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to \npromote the effective realization of the right to food for all; \n \n26. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment, as well as \ninternational assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected \ncountries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food, and in \nparticular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their \nhomes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting their \nenjoyment of the right to food; \n \n27. Takes note with appreciation of the growing movement, in different \nregions of the world, towards the adoption of framework laws, national strategies and \nmeasures in support of the full realization of the right to food for all; \n \n28. Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation \nand utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including \nexternal debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to \nimplement sustainable food security policies; \n \n29. Calls for a successful, development-oriented outcome of the trade \nnegotiations of the World Trade Organization, in particular on the remaining issues \nof the Doha Development Round, as a contribution to the creation of international \nconditions permitting the full realization of the right to food; \n \n30. Stresses that all States should make all efforts to ensure that their \ninternational policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade \nagreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; \n \n31. Recalls the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against \nHunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying \nadditional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty, as well as \nnon-communicable diseases; \n__________________ \n \n18 Resolution 61/295, annex. \n \n19 Resolution 69/2. \n\nA/RES/75/179 \nThe right to food\n \n20-17320\n10/12 \n \n \n32.
