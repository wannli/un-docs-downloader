great majority of the Israeli \nsettlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and \nwhich is causing humanitarian hardship and a serious decline of socioeconomic

the acquisition of land by force and therefore the illegality of the \nannexation of any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East \nJerusalem, which constitutes a breach of
