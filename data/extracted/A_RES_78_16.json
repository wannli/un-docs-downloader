considerable progress has been achieved in developing and applying \nthe latest information technologies and means of telecommunication, \n \nExpressing \nconcern \nthat \ninformation \ntechnologies \nand \nmeans \nof \ntelecommunication can potentially be used for purposes that are inconsistent with the \nobjectives of maintaining international stability and security, to the detriment of \nsecurity in both civil and military fields, \n \nExpressing concern also about malicious information and communications \ntechnology activities aimed at critical infrastructure and critical information \ninfrastructure facilities supporting essential services to the public, \n \nConsidering that it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources or \ntechnologies for criminal or

security\n \n23-24434\n2/4 \n \n \nStressing that it is in the interest of all States to seek the settlement of disputes \nby peaceful means, and to promote the use of information and communications \ntechnologies for peaceful purposes and to prevent conflicts arising from the use of \ninformation and communications technologies, \n \nUnderlining the importance of respect for human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms in the use of information and communications technologies while bridging \ndigital divides, building resilience in every society and sector and maintaining a \nhuman-centric approach, \n \nCalling upon Member States to be guided in their use of information and \ncommunications technologies by the assessments and recommendations of the 2010, \n2013, 2015 and 2021 groups of governmental experts, as well as those of the 2021 \nOpen-ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and \nTelecommunications in the Context of International Security, and the first 1  and \nsecond2 annual progress reports of the open-ended working group on security of and \nin the use of information and communications technologies 2021\u20132025, in particular \nthe cumulative and evolving framework for responsible State behaviour in the use of \ninformation and communications technologies elaborated and adopted by consensus \nthrough these processes, \n \nRecalling the conclusion of the groups of governmental experts and the 2021 \nOpen-ended Working Group that international law, and in particular the Charter of \nthe United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and \npromoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and \ncommunications technology environment, \n \nReaffirming that voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour \nin the use of information and communications technologies can reduce risks to \ninternational peace, security and stability, and do not seek to limit or prohibit action \nthat is otherwise consistent with international law but nonetheless to set standards for \nresponsible State behaviour, while also reaffirming that, given the unique attributes \nof information and communications technologies, additional norms could be \ndeveloped over time and, separately, noting the possibility of future elaboration of \nadditional binding obligations, if appropriate, \n \nRecalling that confidence-building measures in the field of information and \ncommunications technology security can contribute to preventing conflicts, avoiding \nmisperceptions, misunderstandings and the reduction of tensions, and that regional \nand subregional organizations have made significant efforts in developing \nconfidence-building measures, and welcoming the establishment of a global \nintergovernmental directory of points of contact as a confidence-building measure, \n \nSupporting the open-ended working group on security of and in the use of \ninformation and communications technologies 2021\u20132025, underlining the \ncomplementarity of the proposal for a programme of action with the work of the \ncurrent 2021\u20132025 open-ended working group, and reaffirming that the programme \nof action is to take into account the consensus outcomes adopted by the 2021\u20132025 \nopen-ended working group, \n \nReaffirming that any future mechanism for regular institutional dialogue under \nthe auspices of the United Nations should be an action-oriented process with specific \nobjectives, building on previous outcomes, and be inclusive, transparent, consensus-\ndriven and results-based, \n__________________ \n \n1  See A/77/275. \n \n2  See A/78/265. \n\nProgramme of action to advance responsible State behaviour \nin the use of information and communications technologies \nin the context of international security \nA/RES/78/16\n \n3/4\n23-24434 \n \n \nRecognizing the utility of exploring mechanisms dedicated to following up on \nthe implementation of the agreed norms and rules as well as the development of \nfurther ones, \n \nStressing the urgent need to assist States in their efforts to implement the \nframework for responsible State behaviour and tackle emerging threats in the \ninformation and communications technology environment, and, in this context, that \ncapacity-building is essential for cooperation of States and confidence-building in the \nfield of information and communications technology security, and that capacity-\nbuilding in relation to State use of information and communications technologies in \nthe context of international security should be guided by the principles for capacity-\nbuilding included in the final report of the 2021 Open-ended Working Group3 and by \nthe first and second annual progress reports of the 2021\u20132025 open-ended working \ngroup, \n \nUnderlining that a holistic approach to capacity-building in the context of \ninformation and communications technology security is essential and that, in order to \nbridge the digital divide, sustainable, effective and affordable connectivity solutions, \nparticularly for developing States, are necessary,  \n \nEmphasizing the value of further strengthening collaboration, when appropriate, \nwith civil society, the private sector, academia and the technical community, to \nstrengthen security and stability in the information and communications technology \nenvironment,  \n \nUnderlining the importance of narrowing the \u201cgender digital divide\u201d and of \npromoting the full, equal and meaningful participation and leadership of women in \ndecision-making processes related to the use of information and communications \ntechnologies in the context of international security,  \n \nWelcoming the consensus recommendations of the second annual progress \nreport of the 2021\u20132025 open-ended working group, including on the common \nelements for a future mechanism for regular institutional dialogue and its call for \nStates to engage in discussions on the scope, structure and content of the programme \nof action at the sixth, seventh and eighth substantive sessions of the open-ended \nworking group, \n \nRecalling that the proposed United Nations programme of action to advance \nresponsible State behaviour in the use of information and communications \ntechnologies in the context of international security is conceived as a permanent, \ninclusive, action-oriented mechanism to discuss existing and potential threats, to \nsupport States\u2019 capacities and efforts to implement and advance commitments to be \nguided by the framework for responsible State behaviour, to discuss and further \ndevelop, if appropriate, this framework, to promote engagement and cooperation with \nrelevant stakeholders, and to periodically review the progress made in the \nimplementation of the programme of action as well as the programme\u2019s future work, \n \nHighlighting the conclusions contained in the report of the Secretary-General \nsubmitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 77/37,4 including on the normative \nframework for responsible State behaviour, underpinned by a universal affirmation of \nthe applicability of international law and a commitment to confidence-building and \ncapacity-building, which represents a significant milestone in international \ncooperation towards an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and \ncommunications technology environment and must serve as a baseline for all future \nmultilateral work in this area, highlighting also that inclusive and transparent \n__________________ \n \n3  See A/75/816. \n \n4  A/78/76. \n\nA/RES/78/16 \nProgramme of action to

\naction-oriented \nmechanisms \nto \nadvance \nimplementation of the universally endorsed normative framework, and to support \nState capacities in implementing it, including through capacity-building, is most \nwelcome, and highlighting further that the 2021\u20132025 open-ended working group \nshould play a key role in further work on the programme of action, including by \nholding dedicated intersessional meetings in both 2024 and 2025 to ensure that all \npositions are heard, \n \n1. \nWelcomes the report on the proposal for a United Nations programme of \naction to advance responsible State behaviour in the use of information and \ncommunications technologies in the context of international security, prepared by the \nSecretary-General on the basis of the views
