\nindispensable requirement for sustainable development, particularly in Africa, in the \nleast developed countries, in landlocked developing countries, in small island \ndeveloping States and in some middle-income countries, noting with concern that, out \nof 734 million people living in extreme poverty, 38 million fewer will escape extreme \npoverty by 2030, because of the slowdown in the global economy, and underlining \nthe importance of accelerating sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth \nand sustainable development, including full, productive employment and decent work \nfor all, with a view to reducing inequalities within and among countries, \n \nCommending the efforts and remarkable progress achieved by developing \ncountries in eradicating rural poverty, while

for rural \nlivelihoods; scarce non-farm income-generating opportunities; a lack of productive \ncapacity and agricultural transformation; persistent gender inequality; a lack of social \nprotection; insufficient basic infrastructure and services; a lack of or poor adaptive \ncapacity and resilience to cope with the adverse effects of climate change and \ndisasters; and a lack of effective rural institutions and of sufficient resources,  \n \nRecognizing the leading role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations, together with other United Nations entities, including the \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development, the International Labour \nOrganization and the United Nations Development Programme, in the global efforts \nto reduce rural poverty, while

African countries to achieve such goals, \nespecially in the rural areas of the African continent, \n \nNoting that, while considerable progress has been made over the past decade \nacross all areas of development, the pace of progress observed in recent years is \ninsufficient and uneven to fully meet the Sustainable Development Goals and targets \nby 2030, especially in the area of rural poverty eradication,  \n \nRecognizing that poverty is a serious impediment to the achievement of gender \nequality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including those living in rural \nareas, and that the feminization of poverty persists, emphasizing that the eradication of \npoverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is an indispensable \nrequirement for sustainable development, acknowledging the mutually reinforcing \nlinks between the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women \nand girls and the eradication of poverty, and stressing the importance of support for \ncountries in their efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, \n \nEmphasizing that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment depends crucially on the transformation of rural areas, where most of \nthe poor and hungry live, and that in order to eradicate rural poverty, investment \nshould be channelled towards sectors that have a bigger impact, such as education \nand health, agriculture and infrastructure, while noting an annual financing gap for \nreaching universal pre-primary, primary and secondary education of good quality in \nlow-income and lower middle-income countries of $39 billion over the period  \n2015\u20132030, and that at least $80 billion in annual investment will be needed to meet \nthe demand for food that is projected to increase by 70 per cent by 2050, and that the \ninvestments that are needed for climate change mitigation and adaptation also remain \nunderfunded,  \n \nWelcoming the proclamation of 2019\u20132028 as the United Nations Decade of \nFamily Farming, to raise the profile of the role of family farming 4 in contributing to \nthe implementation of the

of rural poverty, \n \nRecognizing the interlinkages and integrated nature of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, and reiterating that the eradication of rural poverty and hunger \nis crucial for the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including \nthose contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that rural \ndevelopment should be pursued through an integrated approach which encompasses \neconomic, social and environmental dimensions, takes into account a gender \nperspective and consists of mutually reinforcing policies and programmes, and which \nshould be balanced, targeted, situation-specific and locally owned, include local \nsynergies and initiatives and be responsive to the needs of rural populations,  \n \nRecalling that nearly 80 per cent of the extreme poor live in rural areas and work \nin agriculture, that the extreme poverty rate in rural areas is three times higher than \nin urban areas, and that devoting resources to the development of rural areas and \nsustainable agriculture and supporting smallholder farmers, especially women \nfarmers, is key to ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions, by, inter alia, \nimproving the welfare of farmers, \n \nTaking into consideration the increasing number of young people who decide to \nleave rural areas for more urbanized ones and the challenges this trend poses to the \nlivelihood of rural families, \n__________________ \n \n4  Resolution 72/239. \n\nA/RES/74/237 \nEradicating rural poverty to implement the\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\n

phenomenon, and the adverse effects of climate change, and \nthat rural women and girls fare far worse on most development indicators,  \n \nEmphasizing the importance of enhancing global support for national work on \nrural development policies and strategies, including on commodity production as well \nas increased public and private investments to upgrade productive capacity, and that

Financing \nfor Development7 is an integral part, supporting and complementing it;  \n \n3. \nExpresses its deep concern that the progress in reducing poverty remains \nuneven, with 1.46 billion people still living in multidimensional poverty, and that this \nnumber continues to be significant and unacceptably high, whereas the levels of \ninequality in income, wealth and opportunities remain high or are increasing in a \nnumber of countries, and the non-income dimensions of poverty and deprivation, such \nas access to quality education or basic health services, and relative poverty remain \nmajor concerns, and stresses the importance of national and global efforts to create \nconditions for sustainable development, inclusive and sustained economic growth, \nshared prosperity and decent work for all in society, taking into account different \nlevels of national development capacities; \n \n4. \nRecognizes the importance of promoting socioeconomic development in \nrural areas as an

pattern with the concerted efforts \nof the whole of society to promote socioeconomic development in rural areas;  \n \n5. \nEmphasizes that economic growth continues to leave rural dwellers \nbehind, that in 2015, 79 per cent of the people living in extreme poverty lived in rural \nareas and 41 per cent of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lived on less than \n$1.90 per day, and recommends that countries promote dedicated and coordinated \nsocial, economic, agricultural and rural development in their national policies, \nincluding by adopting rural-focused poverty eradication strategies in alignment with \nthe 2030 Agenda, social policies aimed at improving human capital in rural areas and \nensuring access to adequate social protection coverage, agricultural policies aimed at
