Recognize that, even though tuberculosis is the leading global cause of \ndeath of people living with HIV, in 2016 less than half of the estimated number of \ncases of tuberculosis in people living with HIV were found and notified, and less than \n60 per cent of known tuberculosis patients were tested for HIV, precluding treatment \nand resulting in preventable deaths; \n \n11. \nRecognize that multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is estimated to account for \none third of deaths due to antimicrobial resistance globally, and that many of the \nSustainable Development Goals may not be attainable if we fail to address \nantimicrobial resistance, that the grave risks to individual and public health posed by \nmultidrug-resistant tuberculosis are cause for alarm, that only 25 per cent of the \nestimated number of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases were diagnosed and \nnotified in 2016, such that the vast majority of those in need still lack access to high-\nquality prevention, treatment and care services and that inadequate investment in \ntuberculosis case detection is a key obstacle to meeting tuberculosis treatment goals, \nand furthermore acknowledge that the response to multidrug-resistant and extensively \ndrug-resistant tuberculosis to date has been insufficient, despite the introduction of \nnew rapid diagnostic tests, efforts to scale up disease management and international \nfinancing, such as from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, \nincluding to help support drug supply, yet globally just over 50 per cent of patients \nenrolled in treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are successfully treated; \n \n12. Acknowledge that multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is a key component of \nthe global challenge of antimicrobial resistance, and express grave concern that the \nscope and scale of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis \n\nA/RES/73/3 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly\n on the fight against tuberculosis\n \n18-16895\n4/10 \n \nillness and mortality place an additional burden on health and community systems, \nespecially in low- and middle-income countries, and thereby pose a critical challenge \nthat could reverse the progress made against the disease, against antimicrobial \nresistance and towards the Sustainable Development Goals, and that there is a \nprofound gap in access to quality diagnosis, treatment and care for those affected, and \nthere is still a low treatment success rate for those who are treated, and therefore \nacknowledge that it is necessary to ensure global collaboration, sustainable and \nsufficient political buy-in and financial investment from all sources, a strong public \nhealth response, including strong and resilient health systems, and additional \ninvestment in research, development and innovation, recognizing that innovation has \nthe potential to benefit society at large;  \n \n13. Note with concern that the protection and promotion of the right to the \nenjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as \naccess for millions of people to tuberculosis health services and to quality, safe, \nefficacious and affordable tuberculosis diagnostics and treatment, remains \nchallenging, especially in developing countries; \n \n14. Recognize the profound socioeconomic challenges and financial hardships \nfaced by people affected by tuberculosis, including in obtaining an early diagnosis, \nin being subject to extremely long treatment regimens, with drugs that could involve \nsevere side effects, as well as in securing integrated support, including from the \ncommunity, and therefore affirm that all these people require integrated, people-\ncentred prevention, diagnosis, treatment, management of side effects, and care, as \nwell as psychosocial, nutritional and socioeconomic support for successful treatment, \nincluding to reduce stigma and discrimination;  \n \n15. Recognize the role played by the Stop TB Partnership/Global Drug \nFacility, which has, since its creation in 2001, increased access to high-quality and \naffordable tuberculosis treatment and diagnostics for populations in need and is open \nas an option to be considered for use by all nations, and therefore encourage all \nnations to use the Stop TB Partnership/Global Drug Facility;  \n \n16. Recognize the potential of digital technologies to be used in a variety of \nways for tuberculosis prevention, treatment and care, including to support health \nsystems by improving the accessibility, quality and affordability of health services \nand to help with adherence, surveillance, logistics management and e-learning;  \n \n17. Recognize the enormous, often catastrophic, economic and social impacts \nand burden of tuberculosis for people affected by the disease, their households, and \naffected communities, and that the risk and impact of tuberculosis can vary depending \non demographic, social, economic and environmental circumstances, and, in order to \nmake the elimination of tuberculosis possible, prioritizing, as appropriate, notably \nthrough the involvement of communities and civil society and in a non-discriminatory \nmanner, high-risk groups and other people who are vulnerable or in vulnerable \nsituations, such as women and children, indigenous peoples, health-care workers, \nmigrants, refugees, internally displaced people, people living in situations of complex \nemergencies, prisoners, people living with HIV, people who use drugs, in particular \nthose who inject drugs, miners and others exposed to silica, the urban and rural poor, \nunderserved populations, undernourished people, individuals who face food \ninsecurity, ethnic minorities, people and communities at risk of exposure to bovine \ntuberculosis, people living with diabetes, people with mental and physical disabilities, \npeople with alcohol use disorders and people who use tobacco, recognizing the higher \nprevalence of tuberculosis among men;  \n \n18. Recognize the various sociocultural barriers to tuberculosis prevention, \ndiagnosis and treatment services, especially for those who are vulnerable or in \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly  \non the fight against tuberculosis \nA/RES/73/3\n \n5/10\n18-16895 \n \nvulnerable situations, and the need to develop integrated, people-centred, community-\nbased and gender-responsive health services based on human rights;  \n \n19. Commit to promoting access to affordable medicines, including generics, \nfor scaling up access to affordable tuberculosis treatment, including the treatment of \nmultidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, reaffirming the World \nTrade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \nRights (TRIPS Agreement), as amended, and also reaffirming the 2001 World Trade \nOrganization Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, which \nrecognizes that intellectual property rights should be interpreted and implemented in \na manner supportive of the right of Member States to protect public health and, in \nparticular, to promote access to medicines for all, and notes the need for appropriate \nincentives in the development of new health products;  \n \n20. Recall with concern that, until recently, no new medicines for tuberculosis \ntreatment had been approved for over 40 years, and acknowledge that innovative \napproaches, including greater engagement between the public and private sectors, will \nbe necessary to develop new vaccines, drugs and other health technologies to respond \nto the tuberculosis epidemic;  \n \n21. Recognize the lack of sufficient and sustainable financing for the \ntuberculosis response, including for the implementation of integrated, people-centred \nprevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of tuberculosis, including community-based \nhealth service delivery, and for tuberculosis research and innovation, including for \nthe development and evaluation of better diagnostics, drugs, treatment regimens and \nvaccines, as well as other innovative care and prevention approaches, such as \naddressing social and economic factors of the disease;  \n \n22. Recognize that, to end the tuberculosis epidemic by 2030, reliable data on \nincidence, prevalence and mortality, where appropriate, disaggregated by income, \nsex, age and other characteristics relevant to national contexts, as well as the \nstrengthening of national capacity for the use and analysis of such data, would be \nneeded to ensure that collective knowledge is transformed into effective and timely \naction, and that progress at both the global and national levels needs to be reviewed \nregularly to ensure that we remain on target;  \n \n23. Take note with appreciation of the ongoing process of drafting a \nmultisectoral accountability framework to accelerate progress to end tuberculosis, as \nagreed in World Health Assembly resolution 71.3 of 26 May 2018;7  \n \n24. Commit to providing diagnosis and treatment with the aim of successfully \ntreating 40 million people with tuberculosis from 2018 to 2022, including 3.5 million \nchildren, and 1.5 million people with drug-resistant tuberculosis, including 115,000 \nchildren, bearing in mind varying degrees of the burden of tuberculosis among \ncountries, and recognize the constrained health system capacity of low-income \ncountries, and thereby aiming to achieve effective universal access to quality \ndiagnosis, treatment, care, and adherence support, without suffering financial \nhardship, with a special focus on reaching those who are vulnerable and the \nmarginalized populations and communities among the 4 million people each year who \nhave been most likely to miss out on quality care;  \n \n25. Commit to preventing tuberculosis for those most at risk of falling ill \nthrough the rapid scaling up of access to testing for tuberculosis infection, according \nto the domestic situation, and the provision of preventive treatment, with a focus on \nhigh-burden countries, so that at least 30 million people, including 4 million children \nunder 5 years of age, 20 million other household contacts of people affected by \n__________________ \n7 See World Health Organization, document WHA71/2018/REC/1. \n\nA/RES/73/3 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly\n on the fight against tuberculosis\n \n18-16895\n6/10 \n \ntuberculosis, and 6 million people living with HIV, receive preventive treatment by \n2022, and with the vision of reaching millions more, and further commit to the \ndevelopment of new vaccines and the provision of other tuberculosis prevention \nstrategies, including infection prevention and control and tailored approaches, and to \nenacting measures to prevent tuberculosis transmission in workplaces, schools, \ntransportation systems, incarceration systems and other congregate settings;  \n \n26. Commit to overcoming the global public health crisis of multidrug-\nresistant tuberculosis through actions for prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care, \nincluding compliance with stewardship programmes to address the development of \ndrug resistance in line with General Assembly resolution 71/3 on antimicrobial \nresistance, improved national, regional and global pharmaco-vigilance, and improved \ntreatment adherence for people with drug-sensitive tuberculosis; universal, equitable \nand affordable access to quality diagnosis, treatment, care and support for people with \ndrug-resistant tuberculosis; global collaboration to ensure accelerated development \nof accessible and affordable diagnostic tools, and shorter and more effective oral \nregimens, including those that meet the unique needs of children; and through an \nurgent response to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and the scale and severity of local \nand national epidemics of the disease;  \n \n27. Ensure that tuberculosis programmes actively contribute to developing \nnational antimicrobial resistance strategies, capacities and plans and that lessons \nlearned from global, regional and national efforts to combat drug-resistant \ntuberculosis inform the design and implementation of both global antimicrobial \nresistance strategies and national action plans according to national contexts;  \n \n28.
