\nproductive employment and decent work for all, with a view to reducing inequalities \nwithin and among countries,  \n \nRecognizing that poverty is a serious impediment to the achievement of gender

policies and programmes, and which \nshould be balanced, targeted, situation specific and locally owned, include local \nsynergies and initiatives and be responsive to the needs of rural populations,  \n \nRecalling that nearly 80 per cent of the extreme poor live in rural areas and work \nin agriculture, and that devoting resources to the development of rural areas and \nsustainable agriculture and supporting smallholder farmers, especially women \nfarmers, is key to ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions, by, inter alia, \nimproving the welfare of farmers,  \n \nExpressing its concern that the extreme poor have limited access to productive \nresources, basic health, education and social protection services, basic infrastructure \nsuch as roads, water and electricity, and

International Conference on Financing \nfor Development6 is an integral part, supporting and complementing it;  \n \n2. \nWelcomes the remarkable progress made since 1990, which has lifted over \n1.1 billion people out of extreme poverty, but also expresses its deep concern that the \nprogress in reducing poverty remains uneven, with 1.46 billion people still living in \nmultidimensional poverty, and that this number continues to be significant and \nunacceptably high, whereas the levels of inequality in income, wealth and \nopportunities remain high or are increasing in a number of countries, and the \nnon-income dimensions of poverty and deprivation, such as access to quality \neducation or basic health services, and relative poverty remain major concerns;  \n \n3. \nRecognizes the importance of promoting socioeconomic development in \nrural areas as an effective strategy at the global level for the eradication of poverty, \nincluding extreme poverty, and therefore underlines the importance of shaping a rural \npoverty eradication pattern with the concerted efforts of the whole of society to \npromote socioeconomic development in rural areas; \n \n4. \nAlso recognizes the critical role and contribution of rural women, \nincluding smallholders and women farmers, and indigenous women and women in \nlocal communities, and their traditional knowledge in enhancing agricultural and rural \ndevelopment, improving food security and eradicating rural poverty;  \n \n5. \nStresses the importance of taking targeted measures to eradicate poverty \nin all its forms and

on-farm and off-farm economic activities, including sustainable agricultural \nand fisheries production;  \n \n8. \nEmphasizes that, globally, 2 billion people, primarily in rural areas in \ndeveloping countries, do not have access to formal financial services, and encourages \nfurther efforts of the international community to offer affordable ways to access \nfinance for the

Also stresses that the achievement of sustainable development and the \neradication of poverty also hinge on the ability and readiness of countries to \neffectively mobilize domestic resources, attract foreign direct investment, fulfil \nofficial development assistance commitments and use official development assistance \neffectively, and facilitate the transfer of technology to developing countries, on \nmutually agreed terms, and further stresses that the resolution of unsustainable debt \nsituations is critical for heavily indebted poor countries, while remittances have \nbecome a significant source of income and finance for receiving economies and their \ncontribution to the achievement of sustainable development;  \n \n13. Recognizes the importance of addressing the diverse needs of and \nchallenges faced by countries in special situations, in particular African countries, the \nleast developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island \ndeveloping States, as well as the specific challenges facing many middle-income \ncountries, and therefore requests the United Nations development system, the \ninternational financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders to \nensure that these diverse and specific development needs are appropriately considered \nand addressed, in a tailored fashion, in their relevant strategies and policies, with a \nview to promoting a coherent and comprehensive approach towards individual \ncountries;  \n\nEradicating rural poverty to implement the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \nA/RES/73/244\n \n5/5\n18-22622 \n \n \n14.
