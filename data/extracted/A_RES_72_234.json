Reaffirms the need to end hunger and famine and achieve food security as \na priority, and to end all forms of malnutrition, and in this regard acknowledges the \nimportant role of the Committee on World Food Security, recalls the Rome \n\nWomen in development \nA/RES/72/234\n \n7/15 \n17-23312 \n \nDeclaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action16 and the importance of the \nUnited Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016\u20132025), and reaffirms the \ncommitment to devote resources to developing rural areas and sustainable agriculture \nand fisheries and supporting smallholder farmers, especially women farmers, herders \nand fishers in developing countries, particularly the least developed countries;  \n \n14.

Expresses deep concern that the lack of adequate sanitation facilities and \nrelated challenges, such as water scarcity and unsafe water, disproportionately affect \nwomen and girls, including their labour force and school participation rates, and \nincrease their vulnerability to violence, and in this regard calls for the strengthening \nof efforts to achieve sanitation for all and to end open defecation, paying special \nattention to women and girls, through efforts to ensure access to sanitation and \nhygiene facilities, including menstrual hygiene management;  \n \n22. Urges all Governments to eliminate discrimination against women and \ngirls in the field of education and to ensure their safe and equal access to, and \nencourage their participation in, all levels of education, including technical, \nvocational, tertiary and non-formal education and training, including in the fields of \nbusiness, trade, administration, information and communications technologies, \nscience, technology, engineering and mathematics and other new technologies, to \neliminate gender inequalities at all levels and to eradicate poverty and allow women\u2019s \nfull and equal contribution to, and equal opportunity to benefit from, development;  \n \n23.
