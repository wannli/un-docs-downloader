\nincluding legislation, to suppress all forms of trafficking in women and girls, to \nprevent, investigate, prosecute and punish perpetrators of trafficking in persons and \nto protect and empower victims, and that not doing so may violate and impair or \nnullify the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the victims, \n \nSeriously concerned that an increasing number of women and girls are being \ntrafficked within and between regions and States, as well as within and between \ndeveloped and developing countries, and recognizing that trafficking in persons \ndisproportionately affects women and girls and that men and boys are also victims of \ntrafficking in persons, including for sexual exploitation and for the purpose of organ \nremoval, \n \nHighlighting the need to incorporate a victim-centred and trauma-informed, and \ngender- and age-sensitive approach, taking into account the specific needs of women \nand girls, including women and girls with disabilities, into all anti-trafficking efforts, \nand recognizing that women in vulnerable situations are particularly susceptible to \ntrafficking in persons for the purposes of sexual exploitation and abuse, prostitution, \nforced labour and other forms of exploitation, and that girls are also susceptible to \ntrafficking in persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation and abuse, forced labour \nand harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage, \n \nRecognizing that pervasive gender inequality, poverty, unemployment, lack of \naccess to quality education, lack of socioeconomic opportunities, barriers to accessing \njustice, gender-based violence, discrimination, including multiple and intersecting \nforms of discrimination, harmful gender stereotypes and negative social norms, \nmarginalization, persistent demand, conflicts, disasters, adverse impacts of climate \nchange, as well as statelessness and migration status, are among the factors that make \nwomen and girls, including Indigenous women and girls, at heightened risk of \ntrafficking in persons, \n \nNoting with concern that some of the demand fostering sexual exploitation, \nlabour exploitation and the illegal removal of organs is met by trafficking in persons, \nand recognizing that trafficking in persons is fuelled by high profits for traffickers \nand demand that fosters all forms of exploitation, \n \nRecognizing the need to adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures, such \nas educational, social or cultural measures, including through bilateral and multilateral \ncooperation, to discourage the demand, which fosters all forms of exploitation of \npersons, especially women and children, that leads to trafficking in persons, \n \nRecognizing also the role that

emergency environments, as well \nas the devastating consequences for women and girls in such circumstances, and \nnoting in this regard the Migrants in Countries in Crisis initiative and the Agenda for \nthe Protection of Cross-Border Displaced Persons in the Context of Disasters and \nClimate Change, resulting from the Nansen Initiative, \n \nRecognizing that in armed conflict and post-conflict situations, trafficking in \npersons, including for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced labour, forced \nmarriage, illegal adoption of children and recruitment and use of children by armed \ngroups for active or support roles, can be prevalent, and in this regard expressing deep \nconcern over its negative impacts on victims of trafficking in persons, and bearing in \nmind the obligation to respect and protect the human rights of all women and girls in \nconflict and post-conflict situations, \n \nRecognizing also the need to reinforce efforts regarding the provision of \nrelevant documents, such as birth registration and identity documents, in order to \nlower the risk of women and girls of being subjected to trafficking in persons and to \nhelp to identify victims, \n \nRecognizing further that, despite the progress made, challenges to preventing, \nprosecuting and combating trafficking in women and girls and to identifying, \nprotecting and assisting the victims of trafficking in persons remain and that further \nefforts should be made to adopt and implement adequate legislation and other \nmeasures and to continue improving the collection and sharing of reliable data \ndisaggregated by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migration status, nationality, \ndisability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts \nand other relevant factors and of statistics, including gender statistics, that would allow \nproper analysis of the nature, extent and risk factors of trafficking in women and girls, \n \nRecognizing that further work is required both to better understand the link \nbetween migration and trafficking in persons and to develop more effective responses \nto eliminate the risk of trafficking in persons in the migration process in order to, inter \nalia, further efforts to protect women migrant workers from all forms of violence, \ndiscrimination, exploitation and abuse, \n \nReaffirming that global efforts, including international cooperation and \ntechnical assistance programmes, to eradicate trafficking in persons, especially in \nmigration contexts and especially trafficking in women and children, demand the \nstrong political commitment, coordinated and coherent efforts and active cooperation \nof all Governments of countries of origin, transit and destination, \n \nConcerned about the misuse of information and communications technologies, \nincluding the Internet, social media and online platforms, for the purpose of profiling, \nrecruiting, controlling and exploiting children, including for child sexual abuse material, \npaedophilia and any other forms of sexual exploitation and abuse of children, as well as \nfor child, early and forced marriage and forced labour, while acknowledging the role that \ninformation and communications technologies and artificial intelligence can play in \npreventing and combating trafficking in persons, assisting victims and eliminating the \nrisk of sexual abuse and exploitation, including by empowering women and children to \nreport such abuses, and by applying a safety-by-design approach to technology, \n \nConcerned also about the increasing activities of transnational criminal \norganizations and others that profit from trafficking in persons, especially women and \nchildren, without regard to dangerous and inhuman conditions and in flagrant \nviolation of national laws and international law and standards, \n \nRecognizing that victims of trafficking in persons are particularly exposed to \nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and \ngirl victims are often subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and \n\nA/RES/79/154 \nTrafficking in women and girls\n \n24-24145\n6/14 \n \nviolence, including on the grounds of their gender, age, ethnicity, disability, culture \nand religion or belief, as well as their origin, and that those forms of discrimination \nthemselves may fuel trafficking in persons, \n \nAcknowledging that women and girl victims of trafficking in persons, owing to \npervasive and persistent gender inequality, are further disadvantaged and \nmarginalized by a general lack of information on or awareness and recognition of \ntheir human rights and by the stigmatization often associated with trafficking in \npersons, as well as by the obstacles they meet in gaining access to accurate \ninformation and recourse mechanisms, including access to justice, legal aid and legal \nprotections in cases of violations and abuses of their rights, and that special measures \nare required for their protection and to increase their awareness, \n \nTaking note of the Kyoto Declaration on Advancing Crime Prevention, Criminal \nJustice and the Rule of Law, adopted in March 2021, 19  which expresses the \nimportance of strengthening efforts to prevent, counter and combat trafficking in \npersons, including by supporting information and data collection and sharing as \nappropriate, through relevant technical assistance by the United Nations Office on \nDrugs and Crime, addressing factors that make people vulnerable to trafficking, \ndetecting and dismantling trafficking networks, including in supply chains, \ndiscouraging demand that fosters exploitation leading to trafficking, ending impunity \nof trafficking networks, conducting financial investigations and using special \ninvestigative techniques under the conditions prescribed by domestic law, and \nprotecting victims of trafficking in persons, \n \nRecognizing the importance of implementing a victim-centred and trauma-\ninformed approach, with full respect for the human rights of victims, to prevent and \ncounter all forms of trafficking in persons for the purpose of exploitation, including \nthe exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, \nforced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the \nremoval of organs, in accordance with the provisions of the Protocol to Prevent, \nSuppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, \n \nReaffirming the importance of bilateral, subregional, regional and international \ncooperation mechanisms and initiatives, including information exchanges on best \npractices, of Governments, intergovernmental and civil society organizations, the \nprivate sector and other relevant stakeholders, to address, in a comprehensive manner, \nthe problem of trafficking in persons, especially trafficking in women and children, \n \nRecognizing that policies and programmes for prevention, protection, \nrehabilitation and recovery, repatriation and reintegration should be developed \nthrough a gender-responsive and age- and disability-sensitive, comprehensive and \nmultidisciplinary and multicultural approach, taking into account the needs of victims \nwith concern for their security and privacy and respect for their full enjoyment of \nhuman rights and with the involvement of all relevant actors in countries of origin, \ntransit and destination, \n \n1. \nTakes
