\ninequality and violence against women and children, recognizing also that \nCOVID-19-induced poverty has deepened as a result of waves of virus resurgence, \nlack of global vaccination, soaring debt levels, rising food prices, massive losses of \njob and livelihoods \u2013 especially among women in the informal sector \u2013 and weakened \nsocial protection systems that have left the poorest behind, and noting with concern \nthat the pandemic has adversely impacted progress towards achieving gender equality \nand the empowerment of all women and girls and that it threatens to undermine

burdens on women and \nsubstantially limits their participation in the social, political and economic spheres, \nand acknowledging the need to implement concrete measures to recognize, reduce \nand equitably redistribute the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic \nwork done by women, including through sustained investment in the care economy, \npromoting a work-life balance, the

development, and in this regard welcoming initiatives that \nfocus on access, skills and leadership towards bridging the gender digital divide, \nincluding by promoting the equal participation of

\ndesertification, deforestation, the adverse impact of climate change and other \nenvironmental issues that have a differentiated impact on women and girls, owing to \ngender inequality and the dependence of many women on natural resources for their \nlivelihoods, emphasizing the need to address disaster risk reduction and strengthen \nresilience with a renewed sense of urgency in the context of sustainable development \nand poverty eradication, recognizing the need to better understand the effects of \ndisasters on women and girls and to reduce their vulnerability by increasing their \naccess to information and facilitating more effective protection, assistance and \nevacuation measures, and that they should therefore be meaningfully engaged, as \n\nA/RES/79/223 \nWomen in

related policies, special attention should \nbe paid to the empowerment of women and girls, thereby contributing to women\u2019s \nfull and equal access to social protection and resources, including income, agricultural \ninputs, land, water, finance, education, training, science and technology and \nhealthcare services, thus promoting food security and nutrition, as well as health,  \n \nRecognizing that the feminization of poverty persists and limits women\u2019s access \nto land, property, resources, labour markets, social protection systems and public \nservices and that the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including \nextreme poverty, is an indispensable requirement for women\u2019s economic \nempowerment, sustainable development and social justice, and recognizing also the \nmutually reinforcing links between the achievement of gender equality and the \nempowerment of all women and girls and the eradication of poverty,  \n \nRecognizing also, in this context, the importance of respect for all human rights, \nincluding the right to development, and of a national and international environment \nthat promotes, for women and girls, inter alia, justice, gender equality, equity, civil \nand political participation and civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights and \nfundamental freedoms in order to achieve gender equality and the advancement and \nempowerment of women and girls,  \n \nRecognizing further the challenges and obstacles to changing discriminatory \nattitudes, negative social norms and gender stereotypes, which perpetuate multiple \nand intersecting forms of discrimination against women and girls and stereotypical \nroles of men and women, and stressing that challenges and obstacles remain in the \nimplementation of international standards and norms to eliminate gender inequality,  \n \nRecognizing that poverty eradication and the achievement and preservation of \npeace are mutually reinforcing, and recognizing also that peace is inextricably linked \nto gender equality and the empowerment of women and to development,  \n \nReiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind,

political participation, as well as equal \nopportunities with men and boys for employment, leadership positions and decision-\nmaking at all levels, that it will work for a significant increase in
