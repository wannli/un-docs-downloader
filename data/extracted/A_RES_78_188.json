manner consistent with States\u2019 obligations \nunder international human rights law, \n \nRecognizing the critical role of teachers and educators, caregivers, parents and \nlegal guardians in ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education, including \ndigital learning, by providing support, including through the necessary training, \naccess to devices, materials and technological infrastructure,  \n \nAcknowledging the contributions of girls to their societies, the empowerment of \nall girls and the enjoyment of all human rights, and recognizing the opportunities to \namplify these contributions through innovation and technological change, education \nin the digital age and access to digital technology and education, while also \nemphasizing the need to ensure that all digital policies and programmes are \nresponsive to the changing needs of girls and the changing digital landscape, and \nrecognizing in this regard the contributions of their families, communities and \nsocieties and the importance of implementing family-friendly and family-oriented \npolicies towards achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all girls and their \nenjoyment of all their human rights in the context of innovation and technological \nchange, and education in the digital age,  \n \nDeeply concerned that the global goal of eradicating poverty by 2030 is slipping \nfrom our reach, and recognizing that the multidimensional impacts of the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic have exacerbated it, increasing the number of poor by \nup to 124 million, causing the extreme poverty rate to rise for the first time in a \ngeneration, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and, inter alia, among \ngirls, the number of people who are still living in multidimensional poverty is still \nunacceptably high, the levels of inequality in income, wealth and opportunities \nremain high or are increasing within and between many countries, and the non-income \ndimensions of poverty and deprivation, such as access to quality education, social \nprotection and essential health-care services, and relative poverty remain major \nconcerns along with extreme and rural poverty,  \n \nRecognizing that urgent national and international action is required to eliminate \npoverty, including extreme poverty, and noting that the impacts of global financial \nand economic crises, volatile energy and food prices and continuing food insecurity \nas a result of various factors are felt directly by households,  \n \nRecognizing also that social protection, education, adequate health care, \nnutrition, full access to clean water, including safe drinking water, sanitation and \nhygiene, skills development and combating discrimination and violence against girls, \namong other things, are all necessary for the empowerment of the girl child, and \nrecalling the importance of mainstreaming a gender perspective across the United \nNations system in relation to the girl child,  \n \nUnderscoring that women and girls may be disproportionately affected by and \nare more vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and are already \nexperiencing an increase in such impacts, including persistent drought and extreme \nweather events, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean \nacidification, which further threaten health, food security and efforts to eradicate \npoverty and achieve sustainable development, and noting in this regard the \nimplementation of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change,17  \n \nNoting with concern the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, including \nwith regard to the right to education, health and adequate food for the poor, including \n__________________ \n \n17  See FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21, annex. \n\nA/RES/78/188 \nThe girl child\n \n23-26044\n4/15 \n \nthose who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations, especially women and girls, who \nare often left behind in the implementation of social protection programmes aimed at \nalleviating rural poverty, recognizing also that rural and agricultural development aid \nincludes only a small fraction of projects aimed at eliminating gender stereotypes and \nnegative social norms and empowering women and girls in rural and remote areas,  \n \nDeeply concerned that the extreme situation of girls in child-headed households, \nincluding those living in rural and remote areas, persists and that poverty, armed \nconflict, climate-related and other hazards, natural disasters, disease outbreaks, \nincluding the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, and other humanitarian \nemergencies increase the incidence of child-headed households, forcing children, \nincluding girls, to undertake adult responsibilities, including being the main \nhousehold earner and caring for younger siblings, and making them particularly \nvulnerable to poverty, violence, including physical, psychological and sexual \nviolence, as well as all forms of discrimination, which seriously inhibits their \ndevelopment and violates and/or impairs the full enjoyment of their human rights, \n \nDeeply concerned also about the continuing lack of recent information and \nstatistics, disaggregated by sex, age, disability, migratory status, geographical \nlocation and other characteristics relevant in national contexts, on the status of \nchildren, including girls, and their socioeconomic conditions, including those in rural \nand remote areas, which are necessary to inform appropriate policy responses by \nMember States and the United Nations system, and recognizing the need to ensure \naccess to high-quality, reliable and timely disaggregated data, \n \nConcerned that, in sub-Saharan Africa, six out of seven new HIV infections \namong adolescents aged 15 to 19 years are among girls, that adolescent girls and \nyoung women aged 15 to 24 years account for 25 per cent of HIV infections despite \nrepresenting 10 per cent of the population, and that AIDS is the leading cause of death \nfor adolescent girls and women aged between 15 and 49 years in the region, further \nnoting with concern that globally rural/urban disaggregated data relating to HIV \nincidence are scarce, with little information on girls below the age of 15 years, and in \nthis regard noting the importance of subnational data and welcoming its emerging \navailability in sub-Saharan Africa,  \n \nRecognizing that women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection in some \nregions and that they bear a disproportionate burden of the impact of the HIV and \nAIDS epidemic, including the unequal sharing of unpaid care and domestic work \nrelated to the care of and support for those living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, \nand that this also negatively affects girls living in rural areas by depriving them of \ntheir childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive an education, often \nresulting in child, early and forced marriage and/or heading households and \nincreasing their vulnerability to the worst forms of child labour and to sexual \nexploitation, \n \nNoting with concern that millions of girls are engaged in child labour and its \nworst forms, including those who have been victims of trafficking in persons and \naffected by armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies, that children without \nnationality or birth registration are vulnerable to trafficking in persons and child \nlabour and that many children face the double burden of having to combine economic \nactivities with unpaid care and domestic work, which deprive them of their childhood \nand hamper the full enjoyment of their right to education and opportunities for decent \nemployment in the future, and noting in this regard the need to recognize, reduce and \nredistribute girls\u2019 disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work,  \n \nRecognizing that girl children are often at greater risk of being exposed to and \nencountering various forms of discrimination and violence and forced labour, which, \namong other things, would hinder efforts towards the achievement of the Sustainable \n\nThe girl child \nA/RES/78/188\n \n5/15\n23-26044 \n \nDevelopment Goals, particularly those Goals that are relevant to gender equality and \nthe empowerment of girls, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to \nensure a just and equitable world for girls, including by partnering with men and boys, \nas an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child,  \n \nRecognizing also that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is \ncritical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Sustainable Development \nGoals, including the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions \neverywhere, including extreme poverty, as well as the full, equal and meaningful \nparticipation of girls in decisions that affect them, in accordance with the age and \nmaturity of the child, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and \nin promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights \nand fundamental freedoms, and recognizing further that empowering girls requires \ntheir active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in \ntheir own lives and communities, including through girls\u2019 organizations with the \nactive support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care \nproviders, as well as boys and men, and the wider community as allies and agents of \nchange for the achievement of gender equality, \n \nDeeply concerned about all forms of violence against children, including those \nthat disproportionately affect girls, such as child prostitution, child pornography and \nother child sexual abuse material, rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence, trafficking \nin persons and the use of information and communications technology and social \nmedia to perpetrate violence against women and girls, and, in addition, about the \ncorresponding impunity and lack of accountability, and that violence against women \nand girls is underrecognized and underreported, particularly at the community level, \nwhich reflects discriminatory norms that reinforce the lower status of girls in society,  \n \nDeeply concerned also by the increased violence against women and girls \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, including in the context of movement restrictions \nand other public health measures as well as restricted access to safety and other \nservices, and emphasizing the need for strengthened prevention and response \nmechanisms for addressing the situation of girls in the COVID-19 pandemic recovery \nefforts,  \n \nDeeply concerned further about all forms of discrimination against the girl child \nand the violation of the rights of the girl child, including girls living in rural and \nremote areas and those with disabilities, bearing in mind their specific needs, which \noften result in less access for girls to inclusive and equitable quality education, \nnutrition, including food allocation, and physical and mental health-care services, in \ngirls enjoying fewer of the rights, opportunities and benefits of childhood and \nadolescence than boys, and in leaving them more vulnerable than boys to the \nconsequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations, early pregnancies and \noften being subjected to harmful practices, such as female infanticide, child, early \nand forced marriage, prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation, and to \nvarious forms of cultural, social, sexual and economic exploitation and violence, \nabuse, rape, incest and honour-related crimes,  \n \nDeeply concerned that, despite its widespread practice, child, early and forced \nmarriage is still underreported, including in rural and remote areas, recognizing that \nthis requires further attention and that child, early and forced marriage exposes the \ngirl child to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often leads to \npremature sexual relations, early pregnancy and early childbearing and increases the \nrisk of obstetric fistula and high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, and \nfurthermore entails complications during pregnancy and childbirth, which often lead \nto disability, stillbirth and maternal death, particularly for young women and girls, \nwhich require appropriate prenatal and postnatal health-care services for mothers, \n\nA/RES/78/188 \nThe girl child\n \n23-26044\n6/15 \n \nincluding in the area of skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, and \nnoting with concern that this reduces girls\u2019 opportunities to complete their education, \ngain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable \nskills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their physical and mental \nhealth and well-being, their employment opportunities and their quality of life and \nthat of their children, and violates and/or impairs the full enjoyment of their human \nrights,  \n \nDeeply concerned also that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a \nviolation, abuse or impairment of human rights and a harmful practice that prevents \nindividuals from living their lives free from all forms of discrimination and violence, \nthat it has wide-ranging and adverse consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, \nthat it is linked to and perpetuates other forms of violence against women and girls \nand other harmful practices and human rights violations and that such violations have \na disproportionately negative impact on women and girls, and underscoring the \nhuman rights obligations and commitments of States to respect, protect and fulfil the \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and to prevent and \neliminate the practice of child, early and forced marriage, \n \nDeeply concerned further that young women and girls are particularly affected \nby water scarcity, unsafe water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene, and \nconcerned furthermore that girls, especially those in rural areas, are often excluded \nfrom full and continued participation in school owing to their burden of water \nprocurement at home, a lack of water and sanitation facilities in schools and \ninadequate access to effective feminine hygiene products,  \n \nEmphasizing that increased and equal access to quality education for young \npeople, especially adolescent girls, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive \nhealth, as well as health care, hygiene and sanitation, dramatically lowers their \nvulnerability to preventable diseases and infections, in particular HIV and other \nsexually transmitted infections,  \n \nRecognizing that, despite gains in providing access to quality education, girls \nare still more likely than boys to remain excluded from quality education, and learning \nlevels for children in rural and remote areas remain low such that achieving gender \nequality in access and learning alone is unlikely to significantly improve girls\u2019 \nliteracy, and recognizing also that among gendered barriers to girls\u2019 equal enjoyment \nof their right to education are child, early and forced marriage, early pregnancy, \nsexual and gender-based violence, including in the digital context, the \ndisproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, the lack of safe and \nadequate sanitation facilities, including for menstrual hygiene, and gender stereotypes \nand negative social norms that lead families and communities to place less value on \ngirls\u2019 education when compared with that of boys,  \n \nDeeply concerned that school-related violence against girls, including sexual \nviolence and harassment on the way to and from and at school, such as violence \nperpetrated by teachers, continues to deter girls\u2019 education and, in many cases, the \ntransition to and completion of secondary education, and that these risks may \ninfluence parents\u2019 decision to allow girls to attend school,  \n \nNoting that school meals and take-home rations attract and retain children in \nschools, and recognizing that school feeding is an incentive to enhance enrolment and \nreduce absenteeism for all girls,  \n \nStressing the need for the international community, the relevant United Nations \nentities, the specialized agencies, civil society and international financial institutions \nto continue to actively support, through the allocation of enhanced financial resources \n\nThe girl child \nA/RES/78/188\n \n7/15\n23-26044 \n \nand technical assistance, targeted comprehensive programmes that address the needs \nand priorities of the girl child,  \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General;18 \n \n2. \nStresses the need for the full and urgent implementation of the rights of \nthe child, including the girl child, as provided under international human rights \ninstruments, and urges States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the \nConvention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons \nwith Disabilities and the Optional Protocols thereto as a matter of priority;  \n \n3. \nUrges all States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Minimum Age \nConvention, 1973 (No. 138),19 and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, \n1999 (No. 182),20 of the International Labour Organization to consider doing so;  \n \n4. \nUrges States to develop or review relevant programmes that promote \ngender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and equal access to \nbasic social services, such as education, nutrition, water and sanitation, birth \nregistration, health care, vaccinations and protection from diseases representing the \nmajor causes of mortality, including non-communicable diseases, and to mainstream \na gender perspective into all development policies and programmes, including those \nspecific to the girl child;  \n \n5. \nCalls upon all countries to extend coverage of social protection, inter alia, \nthrough nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all girls, \nincluding floors, and, by 2030, achieve substantial coverage of persons living in \npoverty and in vulnerable situations, while stressing the importance of taking targeted \nmeasures to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions everywhere, including \nextreme poverty, with enhanced international support and strengthened global \npartnerships, and notes the need for countries, the United Nations development \nsystem and all relevant stakeholders to ensure and promote a multidimensional \ncoordinated approach in their work and efforts to eradicate poverty; \n \n6. \nUrges States to improve the situation of girl children living in poverty, \nincluding extreme poverty, deprived of adequate food and nutrition, water and \nsanitation facilities, with limited or no access to basic physical and mental health-\ncare services, shelter, education, participation and protection;  \n \n7. \nEncourages States and other relevant actors to implement cross-cutting \nand integrated gender-responsive policies and programmes that tackle all forms of \ndiscrimination, which are often compounded, against girls in rural areas and that \nrespond to the multidimensional aspects of adolescent girls\u2019 lives, while taking into \naccount the specific needs and views of girls, including those living in rural and \nremote areas; \n \n8. \nUrges States and other relevant actors to consider strengthening \nmultisectoral child protection systems, to prevent trafficking in girls and violence in \nall its forms, and ensure holistic support for girls who are at greater risk of \nexperiencing, or who have experienced, violence, harassment, exploitation and abuse, \nincluding online and offline, and harmful practices such as child, early and forced \nmarriage and female genital mutilation, while paying special attention to girls with \ndisabilities and girls in vulnerable situations, including Indigenous girls and girls \n__________________ \n \n18  A/76/204. \n \n19  United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1015, No. 14862. \n \n20

that ensuring equal access to inclusive, equitable and quality \neducation requires transformations in education systems, mainstreaming a gender \nperspective into educational programmes, infrastructure development and teacher \ntraining, and in this regard calls upon States to invest in quality education, including \nthrough adequate financing, to ensure that all girls, including those who are \nmarginalized or in vulnerable situations, enjoy their right to education;  \n \n10. Calls upon Member States to work with relevant stakeholders, including \nthe private sector and civil society, to take steps to bridge the digital divide, including \nthe gender digital divide where it exists, within and among countries as part of the \nefforts to ensure the empowerment and safety of all young women and girls, including \nthose living in rural and remote areas, including by providing distance learning \nopportunities, especially in developing countries;  \n \n11. \nEmphasizes the importance of the right of girls to education and the \ncontinuation of learning, acknowledging that during the COVID-19 pandemic \nadolescent girls, as well as girls with disabilities, are at particular risk of dropping \nout and not returning to school even as education facilities reopen, thereby increasing \ntheir vulnerability to poverty, child, early and forced marriage, violence and early \npregnancy;  \n \n12. Calls upon Member States to ensure that school closures are a last resort \nand are proportionate to wider public health restrictions and that girls are protected \nand supported in returning to school once it is deemed safe to do so, and in this regard \ncalls upon Member States and other relevant stakeholders to take the appropriate \nmeasures in order to ensure proper training of teachers and other educational \nprofessionals and the availability of and access to learning materials and remote \nlearning platforms during the pandemic, and to bridge the digital divide, including \nbarriers such as poor access to connectivity, lack of affordability of connection and \ndevices, limited digital skills, absence of locally relevant digital content, and gender \nstereotypes and negative social norms, in order to provide distance learning \nopportunities, inter alia, Internet, television and radio teaching alternatives, especially \nin developing countries;  \n \n13. Notes the role of the United Nations in supporting national Governments \nin the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 21 and in \nrealizing girls\u2019 right to education;  \n \n14. Calls upon States to recognize the right to education on the basis of equal \nopportunity and non-discrimination by making primary education compulsory and \navailable free to all children, including those living in rural areas, and ensuring that \nall children have equal access to quality education, as well as making secondary and \ntertiary education available and accessible to all, in particular through the progressive \nintroduction of free secondary education, bearing in mind that special measures to \nensure equal access, including affirmative action, ensuring physical access to \neducation, including by increasing financial incentives to families, improving the \nsafety of girls on the way to and from school, ensuring that all schools are accessible, \nsafe, secure and free from violence and providing hygienic, separate and adequate \nsanitation facilities, contribute to achieving equal opportunity and combating \nexclusion and ensuring school attendance, in particular for girls and children from \nlow-income families and children who become heads of households;  \n__________________ \n \n21  Resolution 70/1. \n\nThe girl child \nA/RES/78/188\n \n9/15\n23-26044 \n \n \n15. Calls upon all States to place enhanced emphasis on quality education for \nthe girl child, including catch-up and literacy education for those who did not receive \nformal education, special initiatives for keeping girls in school through post-primary \neducation, including those who are already married or pregnant, to promote access to \nskills and entrepreneurship training for young women and to tackle gender \nstereotypes, in order to ensure that young women entering the labour market have \nopportunities to obtain full and productive employment and decent work, and equal \npay for equal work or work of equal value;  \n \n16. Encourages States to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, \neliminating female illiteracy and promoting financial and digital literacy, ensuring \nthat girls have equal access to leadership training, career development, scholarships \nand fellowships, strive to ensure the completion of quality early childhood, primary \nand secondary education, expand vocational and technical education for all girls and \nfoster, as appropriate, intercultural and multilingual education for all, and address \nnegative social norms and gender stereotypes in education systems;  \n \n17. Also encourages States to adopt, as appropriate, and implement inclusive \npolicies and programmes to promote girls\u2019 education in science, technology, \nengineering \nand \nmathematics, \nincluding \ninformation \nand \ncommunications \ntechnology, throughout their education, by, inter alia, expanding the scope of \neducation and training opportunities ranging from basic digital fluency to advanced \ntechnical skills, recognizing that girls who develop such skills may enjoy more \nacademic success and higher-paying jobs in the future, and recognizing also that girls \nand women have an equally important role to play in these arenas as men and boys;  \n \n18. Calls upon States, with the support, where appropriate, of international \norganizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, to develop policies \nand programmes, giving priority to formal, informal and non-formal education \nprogrammes, including scientifically accurate and age-appropriate comprehensive \neducation, relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and \nyoung women and men in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, \nand with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, with \ninformation on sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention, gender equality \nand women\u2019s empowerment, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal \ndevelopment and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to \nbuild self-esteem and informed decision-making, communication and risk reduction \nskills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, \nparents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to, \ninter alia, enable them to protect themselves from HIV infection and other risks;  \n \n19.
