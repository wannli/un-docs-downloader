Treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear \nweapons or other nuclear explosive devices \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecalling its resolutions 48/75 L of 16 December 1993, 53/77 I of 4 December \n1998, 55/33 Y of 20 November 2000, 56/24 J of 29 November 2001, 57/80 of \n22 November 2002, 58/57 of 8 December 2003, 59/81 of 3 December 2004, 64/29 of \n2 December 2009, 65/65 of 8 December 2010, 66/44 of 2 December 2011 and 67/53 of \n3 December 2012, its decisions 68/518 of 5 December 2013 and 69/516 of 2 December \n2014, its resolutions 70/39 of 7 December 2015 and 71/259 of 23 December 2016, as \nwell as its decision 72/513 of 4 December 2017, on the subject of a treaty banning the \nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,  \n \nRecalling also document CD/1299 of 24 March 1995, which indicated that all \nmembers of the Conference on Disarmament had agreed that the mandate to negotiate \na treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other \nnuclear explosive devices would not preclude any delegation from raising for \nconsideration, in negotiations, any issue noted therein, \n \nReaffirming the importance of ensuring continued international commitment \nand high-level attention to making practical progress on achieving a world without \nnuclear weapons and on non-proliferation in all its aspects,  \n \nMindful of the continuing importance and relevance of the Conference on \nDisarmament, and recalling the past achievements of that body in successfully \nnegotiating non-proliferation and disarmament agreements,  \n \nTaking into account the adoption by consensus of the report of subsidiary body 2 \nof the Conference on Disarmament on prevention of nuclear war, including all related \nmatters, with a general focus on a ban of the production of fissile materials for nuclear \nweapons and other explosive devices,1 \n__________________ \n \n1  CD/2139. \n\nA/RES/73/65 \nTreaty banning the production of fissile material for\nnuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices\n \n18-21273\n2/3 \n \n \nLooking forward to the Conference again fulfilling its mandate as the world\u2019s \nsingle multilateral disarmament negotiating forum,  \n \nConvinced that a non-discriminatory, multilateral and effectively verifiable \ntreaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear \nexplosive devices would represent a significant practical contribution to nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation efforts,  \n \nRecognizing the essential role of fissile material in the manufacture of nuclear \nweapons or other nuclear explosive devices and the long-standing efforts of the \ninternational community to negotiate a treaty that would ban its production for such \npurposes, \n \nRecognizing also that a future treaty should not prohibit the production of fissile \nmaterial for non-proscribed military purposes or civilian use, consistent with the \nobligations of States parties, or interfere in any other way with a State\u2019s right to \npeaceful uses of nuclear energy, \n \nRecalling action 15 of the conclusions and recommendations for follow-on \nactions agreed by consensus at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons2 that, inter alia, the Conference \non Disarmament should, within the context of an agreed, comprehensive and balanced \nprogramme of work, immediately begin negotiation of a treaty banning the production \nof fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in \naccordance with the report of the Special Coordinator of 1995 (CD/1299) and the \nmandate contained therein, \n \nUnderlining that the consensus report of the Group of Governmental Experts, \nmandated in resolution 67/53, as contained in document A/70/81, and the \ndeliberations which underpin it, serve as a valuable reference for States and should \nbe a useful resource for negotiators of a treaty banning the production of fissile \nmaterial for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,  \n \nNoting with appreciation the work accomplished in 2017 and 2018 by the high-\nlevel fissile material cut-off treaty expert preparatory group convened by the \nSecretary General following resolution 71/259, on the basis of equitable geographic \ndistribution, to consider and make recommendations on substantial elements of a \nfuture non-discriminatory, multilateral and effectively verifiable treaty banning the \nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, \non the basis of document CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein, \n \nWelcoming the participation of Member States in informal consultative \nmeetings, organized by the Chair of the high-level fissile material cut-off treaty expert \npreparatory group, which were open-ended so that all Member States could engage in \ninteractive discussions and share their views on a treaty banning the production of \nfissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, \n \nConvinced that the report of the high-level fissile material cut-off treaty expert \npreparatory group, mandated in resolution 71/259, as contained in document \nA/73/159, read in conjunction with document A/70/81, should be taken into account \nby future negotiators in their deliberations, \n \nRecognizing the importance of concerted efforts to ensure that both women and \nmen can participate equally, fully and effectively in the negotiation process of a future \ntreaty,  \n__________________ \n \n2  See 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
