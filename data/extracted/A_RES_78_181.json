I, \nsect. A. \n\nImprovement of the situation of women and girls in rural areas \nA/RES/78/181\n \n3/11\n23-26015 \n \nprecarious working conditions experienced by many women engaged in paid care \nwork, and taking into consideration the impacts of armed conflicts on rural women \nand girls and the spiralling effects of the cost-of-living crisis, climate and \nenvironment emergencies and the continuing effects of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic that have compounded underlying and persistent gender gaps \nand inequality,  \n \nExpressing its deep concern that discrimination and violence against women and \ngirls, including those in rural areas, continue to occur in all parts of the world and \nthat all forms of violence and discrimination, including multiple and intersecting \nforms of discrimination, that women and girls face are impediments to the \ndevelopment of their full potential as equal partners with men and boys in all aspects \nof life, as well as obstacles to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, \n \nExpressing its deep concern also that, while agriculture continues to be the most \nimportant employment sector for women in low-income and lower-middle-income \ncountries, with an estimated 25 per cent of employed women around the world \nworking in agriculture, they are relegated to informal, low-paid, low-skilled, labour-\nintensive and vulnerable jobs, at risk of exploitation and abuse and disproportionately \naffected by hunger, malnutrition, food insecurity and poverty, including the \nfeminization of poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, \n \nExpressing its deep concern further that while women contribute more than 50 \nper cent of the food produced worldwide, they account for 70 per cent of the world\u2019s \nhungry, that a widening gender gap in food insecurity, which grew from 1.7 per cent \nin 2019 to 4.3 in 2021, with 31.9 per cent of women in a state of moderate or severe \nfood insecurity compared with 27.6 per cent of men, indicates that women around the \nworld and across regions are more food-insecure than men,  \n \nExpressing concern that many rural women continue to be economically and \nsocially disadvantaged because of their limited access to economic resources and \nopportunities and their limited access or lack of access to quality education, health-\ncare services, justice, land, sustainable and time- and labour-saving infrastructure and \ntechnology, water and sanitation and other resources, as well as to credit, extension \nservices and agricultural inputs, and expressing concern also about their exclusion \nfrom planning and decision-making and their disproportionate share of unpaid care \nand domestic work, \n \nEmphasizing that rural women\u2019s poverty is directly related to the absence of \neconomic opportunities and autonomy and the lack of access to economic and \nproductive resources, quality education and support services and of women\u2019s \nparticipation in the decision-making process, and recognizing that rural women\u2019s \npoverty and lack of empowerment as well as their exclusion from social and economic \npolicies can place them at increased risk of violence that can impede their social and \neconomic development, as well as the achievement of the Sustainable Development \nGoals, \n \nRecognizing that, despite gains in providing access to quality education, rural \ngirls are still more likely than rural boys to remain excluded from education and that \namong the gender-specific barriers to girls\u2019 equal enjoyment of their right to education \nare the feminization of poverty, child labour undertaken by girls, child, early and \nforced marriage, female genital mutilation, early and repeat pregnancies, all forms of \nviolence, including gender-based violence, abuse and harassment on the way to and \nfrom and at school, in their technology-mediated environment, the lack of safe and \nadequate sanitation facilities, including for menstrual hygiene management, the \ndisproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work performed by girls and \ngender stereotypes and negative social norms that lead families and communities to \n\nA/RES/78/181 \nImprovement of the situation of women and girls in rural areas\n \n23-26015\n4/11 \n \nplace less value on the education of girls than that of boys and may influence the \ndecision of parents to allow girls to attend school, \n \nRecognizing also the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of \nTenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security 14 and \nthe Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems, 15 \nendorsed by the Committee on World Food Security, which embrace gender equality \nas one of the main guiding principles of implementation in order to help to address \nthe ongoing disparities with regard to access to and control of land and other natural \nresources, \n \nDeeply concerned that climate change poses a challenge to poverty eradication \nand the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, threatens food security \nand increases the risks of famine and adversely impacts the health and well-being of \nrural women and their families, and that rural women and girls, especially in \ndeveloping countries, are disproportionately affected by the impacts of \ndesertification, deforestation, sand and dust storms, natural disasters, persistent \ndrought, extreme weather events, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean \nacidification and often have limited capacities to adapt to climate change, \n \nRecognizing that women and girls in rural areas may be particularly vulnerable \nto violence because of multidimensional poverty and lack of access to social care and \nprotection services and, as applicable, employment opportunities, as well as negative \nsocial norms, \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General;16  \n \n2. \nUrges Member States, in collaboration with the organizations of the \nUnited Nations system and civil society, as appropriate, to continue their efforts to \nimplement the outcome of and to ensure an integrated and coordinated follow-up to \nthe relevant United Nations conferences and summits, including their reviews, and to \nattach greater

policies and programmes and poverty eradication \nstrategies, including poverty reduction strategy papers, where they exist, aimed at \nimplementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; \n \n(b) \nEncouraging Member States to consider adopting and pursuing national \nfinancial inclusion strategies and gender-responsive strategies to end the structural \nbarriers to women\u2019s equal access to economic resources and to expand peer learning, \nexperience-sharing and capacity-building in rural areas; \n \n(c) \nSupporting the important role of civil society in promoting the
