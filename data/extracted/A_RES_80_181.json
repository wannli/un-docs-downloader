impacts of other disadvantages, and recognizing that \nmeasures of multidimensional poverty account not only for insufficient income but \nalso for deprivation in areas such as health, education and living standards, \n \nNoting with deep concern that many people live in multidimensional poverty \nacross the world, including 1.1 billion in acute multidimensional poverty, \n \nReaffirming that

intersecting forms \nof discrimination and violence, considering that the empowerment of women and girls \nwill make a crucial contribution to progress across all the Goals and targets of the \n2030 Agenda, \n \nRecognizing that women often make up a large portion of the workforce in self-\nemployment and part-time or temporary work and continue to bear most of the \nresponsibility for unpaid care work, having, as a result, lower rates of labour force \nparticipation and shorter formal working careers, which limits their ability to \ncontribute to social security entitlements, and noting

digitalization may contribute to rising inequalities \nand that it also poses new challenges regarding data protection and privacy, \n \nRecalling its resolution 79/194 of 19 December 2024 on
