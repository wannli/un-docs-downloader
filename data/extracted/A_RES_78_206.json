I, Resolutions Adopted by the Conference (United Nations publication, \nSales No. E.93.I.8 and corrigendum), resolution 1, annex I. \n\nA/RES/78/206 \nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation\n \n23-26025\n4/9 \n \nmeans for States to plan for, implement and monitor the progressive realization of the \nhuman rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all without discrimination,  \n \nWelcoming the fact that, globally, from 2015 to 2022, according to The \nSustainable Development Goals Report 2023, the percentage of the world\u2019s \npopulation using safely managed drinking water increased from 69 to 73 per cent, the \npercentage using safely managed sanitation services increased from 49 to 57 per cent, \nthe percentage with access to basic hygiene services increased from 67 to 75 per cent, \nand the number of people practising open defecation decreased from 715 million to \n419 million during this period, \n \nDeeply concerned that, more than 10 years after the adoption of resolution \n64/292, 2.2 billion people lack safely managed drinking water, including 703 million \npeople without basic water service, 3.5 billion people lack safely managed sanitation, \nincluding 1.5 billion people without basic sanitation services, and 2 billion people \nlack a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home, and that achieving \nuniversal coverage by 2030 will require a substantial increase in current global rates \nof progress,  \n \nDeeply concerned also that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic \nexacerbated existing inequalities, and that those disproportionately at risk are women, \ngirls and persons in vulnerable situations, recognizing the need to expand as a matter \nof utmost urgency access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for \nmenstrual health and hygiene management, and to ensure continued access to existing \nservices in this regard, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and \ngravely concerned that 2 billion people worldwide lack basic hand-washing facilities \nat home, which is urgently needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other \ninfectious diseases,  \n \nDeeply concerned further about the lack of access to adequate water and \nsanitation services and its dramatic consequences for the overall health situation in \nhumanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of conflict and natural \ndisaster, and acknowledging that people living in countries affected by armed conflict \nand natural disasters and in countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of \nclimate change, as well as people living in refugee camps, including in refugee host \ncountries, are more likely to lack access to basic drinking water and to basic sanitation \nthan people living in unaffected countries, while acknowledging the efforts of refugee \nhost countries in improving the situation of people living in refugee camps,  \n \nDeeply concerned that achieving universal and equitable access to safe water \nand sanitation services by 2030 will require a fourfold increase in current rates of \nprogress,  \n \nDeeply alarmed by indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting \ncivilian objects in armed conflict, which may injure personnel and damage civilian \ninfrastructure that are critical to the delivery of essential services to the civilian \npopulation, \n \nDeeply concerned that women and girls often face, especially in humanitarian \nemergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural disaster, \nparticular barriers in accessing water and sanitation and hygiene services, as well as \nmenstrual health and hygiene management, and that they shoulder the main burden of \ncollecting household water and of care responsibilities, including those arising from \nwaterborne diseases, in many parts of the world, restricting their time for other \nactivities, such as education and leisure, or, for women, for earning a livelihood,  \n \nDeeply alarmed that water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases hit children \nthe hardest, while noting that child diarrhoea remains a leading cause of death in \nchildren under 5 years of age, and underscoring that progress on reducing child \n\nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation \nA/RES/78/206\n \n5/9\n23-26025 \n \nmortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children\u2019s and women\u2019s universal and \nequitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation and that, in humanitarian \nemergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural disaster, \nchildren suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services,  \n \nDeeply concerned that persons with disabilities, especially children, often lack \nuniversal and equitable access to safe and sustainably managed drinking water and \nsanitation and face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities that are \naccessible and appropriate to their needs, which has an impact on their ability to live \nindependently and participate fully in all aspects of life, including education and \nemployment, which is particularly concerning in situations of homelessness and \nhumanitarian emergencies and crises, \n \nDeeply concerned also that widespread silence and stigma surrounding \nmenstruation and menstrual health and hygiene mean that women and girls often lack \nbasic information and education thereon, whether in school or out of school, and are \nexcluded and stigmatized, that the enjoyment of their human rights, including the \nright to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, \ncan be negatively affected and that they are thus prevented from realizing their full \npotential, \n \nDeeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and \nsanitation services, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, \nespecially in schools and other educational settings, workplaces, health centres and \npublic facilities and at home, negatively affects gender equality, the empowerment of \nwomen and girls and their enjoyment of human rights, including the right to education \nand the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and \nmental health, and recognizing the specific hygiene needs of women and girls during \nmenstruation, and that women have specific hygiene needs during pregnancy, \nchildbearing and rearing and throughout the life course, \n \nDeeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to \nattacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety \nwhile collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside their \nhomes or, when lacking adequate sanitation facilities, practising open defecation and \nurination, limiting their ability to move freely and safely in the public sphere, \n \nDeeply concerned also that non-existent or inadequate sanitation facilities and \nserious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can negatively \naffect water provision and sustainable access to safe drinking water and that, according \nto the United Nations World Water Development Report 2021, an estimated 80 per cent \nof the world\u2019s wastewater is released into the environment without treatment,  \n \nAffirming the importance of regional and international cooperation, where \nappropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to \nsafe drinking water and sanitation, with the understanding that it has no bearing on \nthe issues of international water law, including international watercourse law,  \n \nExpressing concern that climate change increases the frequency and intensity of \nboth sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have \nadverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights \nto safe drinking water and sanitation, and recalling the need to accelerate action on \nmitigation, enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability \nto climate change, including through resilient water and sanitation systems,  \n \nNoting that adequate responses to the adverse impacts of climate change and the \nprogressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are \nlinked to the health and sustainability of ecosystems, including aquatic ecosystems, \n\nA/RES/78/206 \nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation\n \n23-26025\n6/9 \n \n \nRecalling the commitment to step up efforts on all fronts to tackle \ndesertification, land degradation, erosion and drought, biodiversity loss and water \nscarcity, which are seen as major environmental, economic and social challenges for \nglobal sustainable development and for the realization of the human rights to safe \ndrinking water and sanitation,  \n \nRecognizing that, while the implications of climate change-related impacts and \nenvironmental damage for the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water \nand sanitation affect individuals and communities around the world, the consequences \nare felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable \nsituations, such as people living in informal settlements, people living in small island \nStates and rural and local communities, and recognizing also that Indigenous Peoples, \nbecause of their specific situation and nature, may be among the first to face the direct \nconsequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close \nrelationship with the environment and its resources,  \n \n1. \nReaffirms that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as \ncomponents of the right to an adequate standard of living, are essential for the full \nenjoyment of the right to life and all human rights;  \n \n2. \nAlso reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, \nwithout discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically \naccessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right \nto sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable \naccess to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and \nculturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming \nthat both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living;  \n \n3. \nWelcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights \nCouncil on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and invites him to \nwork, within his mandate,17 to collaborate and engage with Member States and other \nstakeholders, including civil society, in achieving the internationally agreed water-\nrelated goals and targets; \n \n4. \nCalls upon States:  \n \n(a) \nTo ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking \nwater and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating \ninequalities in access, including for individuals belonging to groups at risk and those \nwho are marginalized on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, \nreligion and national or social origin or on any other grounds;  \n \n(b) \nTo prioritize as a matter of urgency the provision of safe drinking water \nand sanitation services that are accessible to all, including persons in vulnerable \nsituations, especially in densely populated, impoverished and rural areas, as a means \nof enhancing pandemic preparedness and preventing the spread of infectious diseases; \n \n(c) \nTo protect and restore water-related ecosystems and prioritize, as \nappropriate, in their water management policies, the human rights to safe drinking \nwater and sanitation for all, in particular those affected by lack of access to safe and \nadequate water and sanitation due to poverty or water scarcity; \n \n(d) \nTo implement the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals \nand targets, 18  including the Goal on ensuring the availability and sustainable \nmanagement of water and sanitation for all, consistent with their obligations under \ninternational law;  \n__________________ \n \n17 Human Rights Council resolution 51/19. \n \n18  See resolution 70/1. \n\nThe human rights to safe drinking

drinking \nwater and sanitation;  \n \n(f) \nTo ensure access to safe and affordable drinking water and adequate and \nequitable sanitation and hygiene for all women and girls, as well as for menstrual \nhygiene management, including for hygiene facilities and services in public and \nprivate spaces; \n \n(g) \nTo take measures to empower all women and girls for preparedness in \nhumanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural \ndisaster, by ensuring access to water and sanitation services and implementing \ngender-responsive policies, plans and programmes that address, inter alia, effective \nmenstrual health and hygiene management and adequate disposal options for \nmenstrual products, without compromising their rights, safety and dignity; \n \n(h) \nTo address the widespread stigma and shame surrounding menstruation \nand menstrual hygiene by promoting educational and health practices in and out of \nschools in order to foster

the issue, as well as ensuring \nuniversal access to hygienic products and gender-sensitive facilities, including \ndisposal and waste management options for menstrual products, while recognizing \nthat women\u2019s and girls\u2019 attendance at school, university or, for women, work can be \naffected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain \npersonal hygiene, such as safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools, \npublic places and, for women, the workplace;  \n \n(i) \nTo promote both women\u2019s leadership and their full, effective and equal \nparticipation in decision-making on water and sanitation management and to ensure \nthat a gender-based approach is adopted in relation to water and sanitation \nprogrammes;  \n \n(j) \nTo reduce
