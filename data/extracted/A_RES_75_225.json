World Bank to adapt to changes \nin the global economy,  \n \nNoting with great concern the threat to human health, safety and well-being \ncaused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the severe \ndisruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives and \nlivelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the \npandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals by designing sustainable and inclusive recovery strategies to \naccelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda and to help \nto reduce the risk of future shocks, and recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic \nrequires a global response based on unity, solidarity and renewed multilateral \ncooperation, \n \nRecognizing the unprecedented effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including \nthe severe disruption to societies and economies, as well as to global travel and \ncommerce, and the devastating impact on the livelihoods of people, noting with \nconcern that the number of unemployed people around the world in 2019 exceeded \n188 million according to the International Labour Organization, recognizing that the \npandemic has exacerbated the volatility of global financial markets, increased capital \noutflow from developing countries and exposed the vulnerability of the international \nmonetary system, underlining that the adverse socioeconomic effects of the pandemic \npresent increased and unforeseen challenges for all developing countries, including \nthe most vulnerable countries and those facing specific challenges, and further \naggravate their structural vulnerabilities that have been internationally recognized, \ninter alia, in the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, noting with \nconcern that the pandemic and related global economic and commodity price shocks \ncould significantly increase the number of countries in or at risk of debt distress, \ndeeply concerned about the impact of high debt levels on countries\u2019 abilities to \nwithstand the impact of the COVID-19 shock and to invest in the implementation of \nthe 2030 Agenda, welcoming the steps by the Group of 20 to provide a time-bound \nsuspension of debt service payments for the poorest countries, while noting that more \nneeds to be done,

and economic recession, including \nthrough trade in local currencies, and recognizing also that the COVID-19 pandemic \nrequires a global response based on unity, solidarity and renewed multilateral \ncooperation, including in ensuring supplies of the necessary food, medicine and \nmedical equipment, along with building resilient health infrastructure, \n \nConcerned about the multiple interrelated and mutually exacerbating current \nglobal crises, in particular the world financial and economic crisis, volatile energy \nand commodity prices, the food crisis and the challenges posed by climate change, \nwhich have a negative impact on the development prospects of developing countries \nand threaten to further widen the gap between developed and developing countries, \nincluding the technological and income gap, and which could further undermine the \nachievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the \nSustainable Development Goals, \n \nConcerned also, in this regard, that, although certain regions have made some \nprogress, more than half of the workers in the developing world, about 1.5 billion \npeople, live in vulnerable employment situations, that approximately one in five \npeople in the developing regions live on less than 1.90 United States dollars a day, \nthat 736 million people still live below the international poverty line and that the \nnumber of undernourished people has been on the rise since 2014, reaching an \nestimated 820 million in 2020, \n\nA/RES/75/225 \nTowards a New International Economic Order\n \n20-17626\n4/6 \n \n \nConcerned further about recent economic developments in the context of the \ncontinued challenges to achieving sustained economic growth, in which persistently \nhigh levels of inequality pose a challenge to robust growth and sustainable \ndevelopment, declining private investment in infrastructure highlights the obstacles \nto bridging the infrastructure financing gap and advancing the long-term financing of \nsustainable development, emerging debt challenges and vulnerabilities have intensified \nacross developing countries, global exchange rate volatility has intensified and global \ninflationary trends have diverged, and that the weak prospects for the global economy \nput at risk vital public investment in education, health and action on climate change, \nas well as progress in poverty eradication, especially in developing countries, \n \nConcerned that billions of the world\u2019s citizens continue to live in poverty and \nare denied a life of dignity and that there are rising inequalities within and among \ncountries and enormous disparities of opportunity, wealth and power, \n \nStressing the lack of strong coordinated international response in dealing with \nthe challenges referred to above, illustrating that the calls made in the Declaration \nand the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic \nOrder are still highly relevant, \n \nUnderlining the need for a more sustainable economic growth and recovery, and \nrecognizing that this goal can be achieved through inclusive multilateralism and the \nequal participation of all countries, as envisioned, inter alia, in the Declaration and the \nProgramme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, \n \nRecognizing that innovative and enhanced approaches to financing for \ndevelopment are needed to address the challenges posed by the current global \neconomic situation, poverty and the achievement of the internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, and stressing that \nthese approaches should neither be a substitute for nor negatively affect the level of \ntraditional sources of development financing, including official development \nassistance, and that they need to be developed in a spirit of partnership, cooperation \nand solidarity, bearing in mind the common interests and national priorities of each \ncountry, \n \nRecognizing also that many relevant aspects of the Programme of Action on the \nEstablishment of a New International Economic Order have not been implemented \nand that, consequently, many developing countries continue to face significant \nchallenges to their development prospects, including vulnerability to external shocks \nand lack of adequate representation in global economic governance, \n \nRecognizing further the role played by regional, subregional and interregional \ncooperation as well as regional economic integration, based on equality of \npartnership, in strengthening international cooperation with the objective of \nfacilitating economic coordination and cooperation for development, the achievement \nof development goals and the sharing of best practices and knowledge, \n \nRecognizing that widespread financial deregulation has contributed to larger net \ncapital outflows from developing countries to developed countries, \n \nNoting with deep concern the impact of illicit financial flows on the economic, \nsocial and political stability and development of developing countries, \n \nConcerned that excessively expansionary monetary policies and the ensuing \ncompetitive currency devaluations pursued by developed countries have an effect \nequivalent to an across-the-board export subsidy and a generalized increase in import \ntariffs, which thus nullify or impair existing World Trade Organization market access \ncommitments and further hinder the capacity of developing countries to fulfil their \n\nTowards a New International Economic Order \nA/RES/75/225\n \n5/6\n20-17626 \n \ncommitments to implement all the internationally agreed development goals, \nincluding the Sustainable Development Goals, \n \nStressing the need for policy space to allow for the formulation of national \ndevelopment strategies by developing countries, aimed at bringing prosperity for all, \n \nConcerned with the increasing protectionist measures and adoption of inward-\nlooking policies that undermine the multilateral trading system and increase the \nvulnerabilities of developing countries, and emphasizing the importance of promoting \nan open world economy and generating greater positive effects of globalization, \n \nEmphasizing that multilateralism, including a universal, rules-based, open, \ntransparent, predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral \ntrading system, is the most appropriate platform of international cooperation for \naddressing the challenges facing humanity, \n \nConcerned about the financial risks associated with ongoing monetary policy \nadjustments in developed countries, which could induce instability in the international \nmonetary system, leading to exchange rate depreciation and unsustainable levels of \nexternal debt in many developing and emerging economies, \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General;6  \n \n2. \nNotes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,7 the Addis \nAbaba Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment8 and the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change9 carry forward many of the ideas and recommendations \nof the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order 10 and \nthe Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic \nOrder;11  \n \n3. \nReaffirms the need to continue working towards a new international \neconomic order based on the principles of equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, \ncommon interest, cooperation and solidarity among all States; \n \n4. \nReiterates that States are strongly urged to refrain from promulgating and \napplying any unilateral economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance with \ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations that impede the full \nachievement of economic and social development, particularly in developing countries; \n \n5. \nReaffirms that national development efforts need to be supported by an \nenabling international economic environment, including coherent and mutually \nsupporting world trade, monetary and financial systems and strengthened and enhanced \nglobal economic governance, as well as by respect for each country\u2019s policy space; \n \n6. \nAlso reaffirms the need to step up coordination of macroeconomic policies \namong countries to avoid negative spillover effects, especially in
