Recognize the need for health systems that are strong, resilient, functional, \nwell governed, responsive, accountable, integrated, community-based, people-\ncentred and capable of quality service delivery, supported by a competent health \nworkforce, adequate health infrastructure, enabling legislative and regulatory \nframeworks as well as sufficient and sustainable funding;  \n \n11. \nRecognize the need to tackle health inequities and inequalities within and \namong countries through political commitment, policies and international \ncooperation, including those that address social, economic and environmental and \nother determinants of health;  \n \n12. Recognize that action to achieve universal health coverage by 2030 is \ninadequate and that the level of progress and investment to date is insufficient to meet \ntarget 3.8 of the Sustainable Development Goals, and that the world has yet to fulfil \nits promise of implementing, at all levels, measures to address the health needs of all, \nnoting that:  \n \n(a) \nAt least half of the world\u2019s population lacks access to essential health \nservices, more than 800 million people bear the burden of catastrophic spending of at \nleast 10 per cent of their household income on health care, and out-of-pocket expenses \ndrive almost 100 million people into poverty each year;  \n \n(b) \nAt the current pace, up to one third of the world\u2019s population will remain \nunderserved by 2030 and a measurable acceleration is urgently needed to reach the \nhealth-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030;  \n \n(c) \nDespite major health gains over the past decades, including increased life \nexpectancy, the reduction of maternal and under-5 mortality rates and successful \ncampaigns against major diseases, challenges remain with regard to emerging and \nre-emerging diseases, non-communicable diseases, mental disorders and other mental \nhealth conditions, as well as neurological disorders, communicable diseases, \nincluding HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and antimicrobial resistance, noting \nthat non-communicable diseases account for over 70 per cent of all deaths in the \n30\u201369 age group;  \n \n(d) \nDespite the progress achieved at the global level, many health systems are \nnot sufficiently prepared to respond to the needs of the rapidly ageing population;  \n \n(e) \nThe high prices of some health products, and inequitable access to such \nproducts within and among countries, as well as financial hardships associated with \nhigh prices of health products, continue to impede progress towards achieving \nuniversal health coverage;  \n \n13. Recognize that primary health care brings people into first contact with \nthe health system and is the most inclusive, effective and efficient approach to \nenhance people\u2019s physical and mental health, as well as social well-being, and that \nprimary health care is the cornerstone of a sustainable health system for universal \nhealth coverage and health-related Sustainable Development Goals, as was declared \nin the Declaration of Alma-Ata and reaffirmed in the Declaration of Astana;  \n \n14. Recognize the fundamental importance of equity, social justice and social \nprotection mechanisms as well as the elimination of the root causes of discrimination \nand stigma in health-care settings to ensure universal and equitable access to quality \nhealth services without financial hardship for all people, particularly for those who \nare vulnerable or in vulnerable situations; \n \n15. Recognize the consequence of the adverse impact of climate change, \nnatural disasters, extreme weather events as well as other environmental determinants \nof health, such as clean air, safe drinking water, sanitation, safe, sufficient and \nnutritious food and secure shelter, for health and in this regard underscore the need to \n\nA/RES/74/2 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage\n \n19-17549\n4/12 \n \nfoster health in climate change adaptation efforts, underlining that resilient and \npeople-centred health systems are necessary to protect the health of all people, in \nparticular those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations, particularly those \nliving in small island developing States; \n \n16. Recognize that food security and food safety, adequate nutrition and \nsustainable, resilient and diverse nutrition-sensitive food systems are important \nelements for healthier populations;  \n \n17. Note that the increasing number of complex emergencies is hindering the \nachievement of universal health coverage and that coherent and inclusive approaches \nto safeguard universal health coverage in emergencies are essential, including through \ninternational cooperation, ensuring the continuum and provision of essential health \nservices and public health functions, in line with humanitarian principles; \n \n18. Recognize the need for strong global, regional and national partnerships \nfor Sustainable Development Goals, which engage all relevant stakeholders to \ncollaboratively support the efforts of Member States to achieve health-related \nSustainable Development Goals, including universal health coverage;  \n \n19. Recognize that the world spends 7.5 trillion United States dollars on \nhealth, which is close to 10 per cent of global gross domestic product, but that the \nallocation of public and external funds on health worldwide is disproportionate, \nconsidering that:  \n \n(a) \nOn average, one third of national health expenditure is covered by out-of-\npocket expenses, while less than 40 per cent of funding on primary health care is from \npublic sources in low- and middle-income countries;  \n \n(b) \nExternal funding represents less than 1 per cent of global health \nexpenditure and there are important funding gaps given existing health needs, \nwhereas low-income countries still rely on aid, which accounts for about 30 per cent \nof national health spending;  \n \n20. Recognize that people\u2019s engagement, particularly of women and girls, \nfamilies and communities, and the inclusion of all relevant stakeholders is one of the \ncore components of health system governance, to fully empower all people in \nimproving and protecting their own health, giving due regard to addressing and \nmanaging conflicts of interest and undue influence, contributing to the achievement \nof universal health coverage for all, with a focus on health outcomes;  \n \n21. Recognize the vital importance of strengthening legislative and regulatory \nframeworks and institutions for the achievement of universal health coverage;  \n \n22. Recognize that fighting corruption at all levels and in all its forms is a \npriority and that corruption is a serious barrier to effective resource mobilization and \nallocation and diverts resources away from activities that are vital for poverty \neradication and sustainable development, which may undermine efforts to achieve \nuniversal health coverage; \n \n23. Express concern at the global shortfall of 18 million health workers, \nprimarily in low- and middle-income countries, and recognize the need to train, build \nand retain a skilled health workforce, including nurses, midwives and community \nhealth workers, who are an important element of strong and resilient health systems, \nand further recognize that increased investment in a more effective and socially \naccountable health workforce can unleash significant socioeconomic gains and \ncontribute to the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, empowerment \nof all women and girls and reduction of inequality;  \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage \nA/RES/74/2\n \n5/12\n19-17549 \n \n \nWe therefore commit to scale up our efforts and further implement the following \nactions: \n \n24. Accelerate efforts towards the achievement of universal health coverage \nby 2030 to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all throughout the life \ncourse, and in this regard re-emphasize our resolve: \n \n(a) \nTo progressively cover 1 billion additional people by 2023 with quality \nessential health services and quality, safe, effective, affordable and essential \nmedicines, vaccines, diagnostics and health technologies, with a view to covering all \npeople by 2030;  \n \n(b) \nTo stop the rise and reverse the trend of catastrophic out-of-pocket health \nexpenditure by providing measures to ensure financial risk protection and eliminate \nimpoverishment due to health-related expenses by 2030, with special emphasis on the \npoor as well as those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations;  \n \n25. Implement the most effective, high-impact, quality-assured, people-\ncentred, gender- and disability-responsive and evidence-based interventions to meet \nthe health needs of all throughout the life course, and in particular those who are \nvulnerable or in vulnerable situations, ensuring universal access to nationally \ndetermined sets of integrated quality health services at all levels of care for \nprevention, diagnosis, treatment and care in a timely manner;  \n \n26.

Prioritize health promotion and disease prevention, through public health \npolicies, good governance of health systems, education, health communication and \nhealth literacy, as well as safe, healthy and resilient cities, enabling people, \nthroughout their life course, including, among others, adolescents, to have increased \nknowledge to take informed health decisions and improve health-seeking behaviour; \n \n28. Take multisectoral action to promote active and healthy lifestyles, \nincluding physical activity for the benefit of all people throughout their life course, \nand ensure a world free from malnutrition in all its forms, where all people are \nempowered to take responsibility for their own health, supported by public regulatory \nmeasures, and have access to safe drinking water and sanitation and safe, sufficient \nand nutritious food and enjoy diversified, balanced and healthy diets throughout their \nlife course, with special emphasis to the nutrition needs of pregnant and lactating \nwomen, women of reproductive age and adolescent girls, and of infants and young \nchildren, especially during the first 1,000 days, including, as appropriate, through \nexclusive breastfeeding during the first six months, with continued breastfeeding to \n2 years of age or beyond, with appropriate complementary feeding;  \n \n29. Take measures to reduce maternal, neonatal, infant and child mortality and \nmorbidity and increase access to quality health-care services for newborns, infants \nand children, as well as all women before, during and after pregnancy and childbirth; \n \n30.

Implement measures to promote and improve mental health and well-being \nas an essential component of universal health coverage, including by scaling up \ncomprehensive and integrated services for prevention, including suicide prevention, \nas well as treatment for people with mental disorders and other mental health \nconditions as well as neurological disorders, providing psychosocial support, \npromoting well-being, strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, \naddressing social determinants and other health needs, and fully respecting their \nhuman rights, noting that mental disorders and other mental health conditions as well \nas neurological disorders are an important cause of morbidity and contribute to the \nnon-communicable diseases burden worldwide;  \n \n37. Increase access to health services for all persons with disabilities, remove \nphysical, attitudinal, social, structural and financial barriers, provide quality standard \nof care and scale up efforts for their empowerment and inclusion, noting that persons \nwith disabilities, who represent 15 per cent of the global population, continue to \nexperience unmet health needs;  \n \n38. Scale up efforts to promote healthier and safer workplaces and improve \naccess to occupational health services, noting that more than 2 million people die \nevery year from preventable occupational diseases and injuries;  \n \n39. Pursue efficient health financing policies, including through close \ncollaboration among relevant authorities, including finance and health authorities, to \nrespond to unmet needs and to eliminate financial barriers to access to quality, safe, \neffective, affordable and essential health services, medicines, vaccines, diagnostics \nand health technologies, reduce out-of-pocket expenditures leading to financial \nhardship and ensure financial risk protection for all throughout the life course, \nespecially for the poor and those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations, \nthrough better allocation and use of resources, with adequate financing for primary \nhealth care, in accordance with national contexts and priorities;  \n \n40. Scale up efforts to ensure there are nationally appropriate spending targets \nfor quality investments in public health services, consistent with national sustainable \ndevelopment strategies, in accordance with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and \ntransition towards sustainable financing through domestic public resource \nmobilization;  \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage \nA/RES/74/2\n \n7/12\n19-17549 \n \n \n41.

Expand quality essential health services, strengthen health systems and \nmobilize resources in health and other health-related Sustainable Development Goals \nin developing countries, noting that, according to World Health Organization \nestimates, an additional 3.9 trillion dollars in total by 2030 could prevent 97 million \npremature deaths and add between 3.1 and 8.4 years of life expectancy in low- and \nmiddle-income countries;  \n \n43. Optimize budgetary allocations on health, sufficiently broaden fiscal \nspace, and prioritize health in public spending, with the focus on universal health \ncoverage, while ensuring fiscal sustainability, and in this regard encourage countries \nto review whether public health expenditure is adequate to ensure sufficiency and \nefficiency of public spending on health and, based on such review, to adequately \nincrease public spending, as necessary, with a special emphasis on primary health \ncare, where appropriate, in accordance with national contexts and priorities, while \nnoting the World Health Organization recommended target of an additional 1 per cent \nof gross domestic product or more;  \n \n44. Promote and implement policy, legislative and regulatory measures, \nincluding fiscal measures as appropriate, aiming at minimizing the impact of the main \nrisk factors for non-communicable diseases, and promote healthy diets and lifestyles, \nconsistent with national policies, noting that price and tax measures can be an \neffective means to reduce consumption and related health-care costs and represent a \npotential revenue stream for financing for development in many countries;  \n \n45. Provide adequate, predictable, evidence-based and sustainable finances, \nwhile improving their effectiveness, to support national efforts in achieving universal \nhealth coverage, in accordance with national contexts and priorities, through \ndomestic, bilateral, regional and multilateral channels, including international \ncooperation, financial and technical assistance, considering the use of traditional and \ninnovative financing mechanisms such as, inter alia, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Financing Facility \nfor Women, Children and Adolescents and the United Nations trust fund for human \nsecurity, within their respective mandates, as well as partnerships with the private \nsector and other relevant stakeholders, recognizing that health financing requires \nglobal solidarity and collective effort;  \n \n46.
