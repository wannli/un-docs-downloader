as a result of the impacts from the spread of COVID-19 \nand due to extreme weather events and that the COVID-19 pandemic has had \nwidespread impacts on agricultural production systems, including those producing \nnatural plant fibres, as it has disrupted natural plant fibre production and value chains \nowing to restrictions in the movement and availability of inputs, labour, post-harvest \nservices and timely access to markets, and has challenged the livelihoods of farmers, \nincluding small-scale and family farmers and workers dependent on agriculture, \nincluding migrant workers,
