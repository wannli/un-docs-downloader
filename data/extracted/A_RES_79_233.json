Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for \nthe Decade 2024\u20132034 \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly \n \nAdopts the Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034, as contained in the annex to the present resolution, and calls upon \nall relevant stakeholders to commit to implementing the Programme of Action. \n \n55th (resumed) plenary meeting \n24 December 2024 \n \nAnnex \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade \n2024\u20132034 \n \nIntroduction \n \nIn quest of sustainable and resilient development in landlocked developing \ncountries to accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals \n \n1. \nWe are at a defining moment in history where the decisions we make now will \ndetermine the future of the 32 landlocked developing countries situated in Africa, \nAsia, Europe and South America, with a population of about 570 million, which \ncontinue to face a highly challenging pathway to sustainable development. Their \ninherent geographical and structural constraints related to the lack of direct territorial \naccess to the sea, obstacles to transport and communication, long distances from \nmajor markets, cumbersome transit procedures and inadequate infrastructure are \nfurther exacerbated by unprecedented global challenges and crises, including the \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n2/48 \n \nlingering effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID\u201119) pandemic, geopolitical \ntensions and conflicts, food and energy crises, high transportation and trade costs, \nhigh interest rates, inflation, high indebtedness, climate change, biodiversity loss, \ndesertification and pollution.  \n2. \nThe years of cascading challenges, in which a health and socioeconomic crisis \nhas shaken everyone, individually and collectively, threaten the attainment of the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 1 and all the Sustainable Development \nGoals. The world is plagued by growing poverty, hunger and malnutrition, \ninequalities, human rights violations, digital divides within countries and between \ndeveloped and developing countries, vaccine inequity, complex humanitarian \nemergencies and armed conflict, insecurity, pandemics, environmental degradation, \nclimate change and disasters. The situation for landlocked developing countries is \nparticularly bleak. The situation demands urgent mobilization of our collective \nresources, decisive actions by all and innovative solutions to the unprecedented \nchallenges. In this context, we strongly reaffirm our unwavering commitment to work \ntirelessly for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals in a balanced and integrated manner in its three dimensions, \nincluding by taking tangible steps and calling for greater action and extraordinary \nmeasures by all countries; and strengthened international and multilateral cooperation \nto support the landlocked developing countries in this endeavour and to reach the \nfurthest behind first.  \n3. \nWe are guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \nNations, including full respect for international law. It is grounded in the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights,2 international human rights treaties, the United Nations \nMillennium Declaration3 and the 2005 World Summit Outcome.4 It is informed by \nother instruments such as the Declaration on the Right to Development. 5 We recognize \nthe need to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies that provide equal access to \njustice and that are based on respect for human rights, on effective rule of law and \ngood governance at all levels and on transparent, effective and accountable \ninstitutions.  \n4. \nWe further reaffirm our commitment to enhancing our efforts for the full and \ntimely implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals, \nthe Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing \nfor Development,6 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 7 \nand the Paris Agreement 8 and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction \n2015\u20132030,9 particularly with regard to the special development needs and challenges \nof landlocked developing countries.  \n5. \nWe reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and \nDevelopment, 10  including, inter alia, the principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities, as set out in principle 7 thereof.  \n_______________ \n \n1 Resolution 70/1. \n \n2 Resolution 217 A (III). \n \n3 Resolution 55/2. \n \n4 Resolution 60/1. \n \n5 Resolution 41/128, annex. \n \n6 Resolution 69/313, annex. \n \n7 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1771, No. 30822. \n \n8 Adopted under the UNFCCC in FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21. \n \n9 Resolution 69/283, annex II. \n \n10 Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Rio de Janeiro, \n3\u201314 June 1992, vol. I, Resolutions Adopted by the Conference (United Nations publication, \nSales No. E.93.I.8 and corrigendum), resolution 1, annex I. \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n3/48\n24-24446 \n \n6. \nWe note that mixed progress was made in the implementation of the six priority \nareas of the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for \nthe Decade 2014\u20132024. 11  The combined effects of the COVID\u201119 pandemic, \ngeopolitical tensions and conflict, and climate change, affected progress. We note \nwith concern that the severe financing deficit, in particular for infrastructure, limited \ndata and technical capacity constraints also undermined progress. Additionally, \nadverse global economic conditions characterized by tepid growth, surging inflation, \nincreased pressure on energy, food and finance, supply chain disruptions and elevated \ntrade costs continue to affect the recovery efforts of landlocked developing countries. \nFurthermore, landlocked developing countries were significantly affected by \ndisasters, many of which are exacerbated by climate change, biodiversity loss and \ndisasters, such as desertification, recurrent droughts, melting glaciers, floods and \nglacier lake outburst floods.  \n7. \nWe recognize the limited progress that has been made during the implementation \nperiod of the Vienna Programme of Action. Considerable efforts have contributed to \nthe realization of meaningful outcomes, including in facilitating trade, fostering \nregional integration, accession of landlocked developing and transit countries to \ninternational conventions for the promotion of transit and trade, and completing \nmissing links and improving the quality of infrastructure for increased connectivity.  \n8. \nHowever, we note with concern that progress fell short of the goals and targets \nset out in the Vienna Programme of Action. Economic growth across the landlocked \ndeveloping countries was modest and insufficient to eradicate poverty and reduce \ninequality, particularly among women, children and people in vulnerable situations, \nas well as people working in informal sectors.  \n9. \nWe are concerned that landlocked developing countries have made very limited \nprogress towards achieving structural transformation. We also note with concern that \nthe economic structure of the landlocked developing countries continues to be \ncharacterized by a low level of diversification, with exports concentrated in a limited \nnumber of products, which tend to have low value addition and to be greatly \nsusceptible to current and possible future external shocks and hazards. Road, rail, \nwater and air transport infrastructure, and connecting river ports and seaports, remain \ninsufficiently funded and underdeveloped, with huge missing links and inadequate \nmaintenance.  \n10. We note with concern that the share of global merchandise exports of landlocked \ndeveloping countries remains marginal, at only 1.1 per cent of the total global share \nin 2022. There was a growing interest in regional integration and cooperation among \nlandlocked developing countries. The number of regional trade agreements that each \nlandlocked developing country is a party to has increased, on average, from 3.3 in \n2014 to 4.3 in 2023.  \n11. \nWe express our concern that, while there was some progress in the allocation of \nofficial development assistance and aid for trade to landlocked developing countries, \nforeign direct investment flows declined and have largely been concentrated in natural \nresources. Furthermore, a large number of landlocked developing countries are either \nin debt distress or at a high risk of it.  \n12. We note that technology is rapidly changing the global economic landscape. It \nis reshaping work processes, production and distribution methods and consumption \npatterns. It is driving new innovations and fostering growth opportunities. It can also \nbridge the existing digital divides, including the growing gender digital divide, and \naccelerate progress for inclusive and sustainable development. Despite extraordinary \n_______________ \n \n11 Resolution 69/137, annex II. \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n4/48 \n \nopportunities, landlocked developing countries are not able to fully harness its \npotentials. This is due to a number of constraints, including infrastructure gaps, the \nrelatively high cost of information and communications technology services, low \ndigital literacy rates, insufficient regulatory frameworks and the high cost of \naccessing submarine cables.  \n13. We recognize that, during the implementation period, there was significant \ndevelopment of regional, subregional and multilateral initiatives to support transit. \nProgress was also made in ratifying the relevant legal agreements. Tools were \ndeveloped to improve transit, such as the World Customs Organization transit \nguidelines, electronic consignment note and electronic TIR. Some progress was made \nin some corridors on the specific objective of the Vienna Programme of Action of \nreducing travel time along corridors.  \n14. We also note that some progress was made in completing missing links and \ngenerally improving the quality of infrastructure for increased connectivity of \nlandlocked developing countries, but challenges remain. Several highway networks \nand railway lines were commissioned in those countries during the implementation \nperiod, but many more are needed.  \n15. We recognize the challenges that hampered the full implementation of the \nVienna Programme of Action, including the persisting insufficiency and inadequacy \nof means of implementation, a lack of capacity in formulating financially viable \ninfrastructure projects, low flows of official development assistance, the \nconcentration of investment inflows towards natural resources, high debt \nvulnerabilities and multiple international crises, including the COVID\u201119 pandemic, \nthat have had a disproportionately severe impact on the landlocked developing \ncountries. \n16. We reaffirm the importance of promoting unfettered, efficient and cost-effective \naccess to and from the sea by all means of transport, on the basis of the freedom of \ntransit, and other related measures, in accordance with applicable rules of \ninternational law. We reaffirm the need to reduce trade transaction costs and transport \ncosts, and to develop adequate transit transport infrastructure networks. We recognize \nthe \ncontinued \nimportance \nof \nstructural \ntransformation, \nvalue \naddition, \nindustrialization and diversification.  \n17. We recognize that increased participation in international trade, anchored in a \nstrengthened multilateral trading system that is equitable and fair, is critical to the \neconomic growth of landlocked developing countries and the realization of the \nSustainable Development Goals. We recognize the crucial role of transport corridors \nas the backbone of transportation networks, linking major gateways and hubs, to \nenhance landlocked developing countries\u2019 connectivity to markets, achieve efficient \ntransit and reduce transport costs.  \n18. We also recognize the importance of investment in supporting human capital \ndevelopment through inclusive, equitable, quality education and skills training for all, \nincluding for those in vulnerable situations. We acknowledge the importance of \nquality science, technology, engineering and mathematics education and institutional \ncapacity development in landlocked developing countries in order to accelerate \npoverty reduction and effective sustainable development measures.  \n19. We recognize that landlocked developing countries require greater technical \nassistance and capacity-development support in several areas, including the effective \naccession to and ratification and implementation of relevant regional agreements, \ndeveloping bankable projects, implementing effective, targeted industrial policies, the \nindustrialization of agriculture and diversification of their production and export base, \npromoting innovation and the greater use and adaptation of technology, strengthening \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n5/48\n24-24446 \n \ndomestic resource mobilization and substantially reducing illicit financial flows, and \nstrengthening the enabling environment for investments.  \n20. We express concern that the gender gap persists across all areas, including with \nrespect to assets, inputs and services. We reaffirm that gender equality and the \nempowerment of all women and girls will make a crucial contribution to progress \nacross all the Sustainable Development Goals and targets in landlocked developing \ncountries. We underline the urgent need to invest in and strengthen efforts to support \nthe empowerment of all women and girls, including by removing all legal, social and \neconomic barriers to achieving gender equality.  \n21. We further recognize that strong bilateral, multilateral and multi-stakeholder \npartnerships are critical and commit to working in collaboration with academia, civil \nsociety and the private sector to drive innovation that will identify solutions to \npressing development challenges and the implementation of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and the Programme of Action, including through transparent, \neffective and accountable public-private partnerships.  \n22. We recognize that landlocked developing countries, due to their structural \nconstraints, in addition to their landlockedness, require additional efforts, including \nadditional borrowing, to stimulate their development, which affects their fiscal space \nand in turn impacts the policy space they require to support their sustainable \ndevelopment. This situation creates a bottleneck in financing for development and \ndemands responses and solutions tailored to the specificities of these countries.  \n23. With this in mind, the present Programme of Action determines a renewed and \nstrengthened commitment by the landlocked developing countries, transit countries, \ndevelopment partners, the United Nations system and international, regional and \nsubregional organizations, multilateral and regional development banks and the \ninternational community as a whole. It is grounded in the overarching goals of \naddressing the special development needs, vulnerabilities and challenges of \nlandlocked developing countries arising from their landlockedness, remoteness and \ngeographical constraints in a more coherent manner to contribute to an enhanced rate \nof sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, effective participation in \ninternational trade and the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, \nincluding extreme poverty. This will be achieved through a reinvigorated global \npartnership for sustainable development based on scaled-up and ambitious means of \nimplementation and diverse support for the landlocked developing countries through \nforging the widest possible coalition of multi-stakeholder partnerships. We will also \npromote a disaster risk-informed approach to sustainable development at the local, \nnational, regional and global levels and accelerate progress on integrating disaster \nrisk reduction into policies, programmes and investments at all levels.  \n24. We emphasize that the present Programme of Action is based on a \ncomprehensive, results-oriented, quantifiable, forward-looking, coherent, renewed \nand strengthened global partnership for landlocked developing countries that is fully \naligned with the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals, the Addis \nAbaba Action Agenda, the Sendai Framework and the Paris Agreement, between \nlandlocked developing countries and the transit countries and their development \npartners, as well as with the relevant international and regional organizations, the \nprivate sector, civil society and other relevant stakeholders.  \n25. We therefore emphasize that the theme of the Conference, \u201cDriving progress \nthrough partnerships\u201d, articulates the most practical and reliable way for landlocked \ndeveloping countries to achieve the goals and targets set in the present Programme of \nAction.  \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n6/48 \n \n26. We invite the landlocked developing countries, transit countries, their \ndevelopment partners, the United Nations system and all other relevant stakeholders \nto implement the relevant actions, agreed upon in the present Programme of Action \nin its five priority areas, in a coordinated, coherent and expeditious manner consistent \nwith national priorities. We also call upon relevant organizations and bodies of the \nUnited Nations system and invite international organizations and relevant regional \nand subregional organizations, to integrate the Programme of Action into their \nprogrammes of work, as appropriate, within their respective mandates.  \n27. We emphasize that partnerships between landlocked developing countries and \ntransit countries are mutually beneficial for the improvement and constant \nmaintenance of their infrastructure connectivity and of technical and administrative \narrangements in their transport, customs and logistics systems. Efficient transit \ntransport systems, strong collaborative efforts in multimodal transport infrastructure \ndevelopment and interlinkage, the promotion of an enabling legal environment and \ninstitutional \narrangements \nand \nstrong \nnational \nleadership \non \ncooperative \narrangements between landlocked developing countries and transit countries are also \ncrucial for achieving structural transformation and sustainable economic growth and \ndevelopment.  \n28. We underscore that the ownership, leadership and primary responsibility for \ndevelopment in landlocked developing countries lies with the landlocked developing \ncountries themselves as articulated through their own national economic and \ndevelopment policies and strategies. We nevertheless emphasize that the development \nof the landlocked developing countries rests not only upon themselves but with the \ncollective efforts and essential support, cooperation and development assistance of \nthe international community.  \n29. We reaffirm that renewed and strengthened partnerships with development \npartners will be crucial for the full and timely implementation of the present \nProgramme of Action. The international community, including financial and \ndevelopment institutions, multilateral organizations and agencies and donor \ncountries, is urged to provide adequate financial and technical support to advance the \nspecific objectives listed herein. Regional and subregional cooperation or integration \nshould also play an important role in successfully addressing the specific problems of \nlandlocked developing countries.  \n30. We further welcome and re-emphasize the role of international development \ncooperation, particularly North-South cooperation, which remains a fundamental \ncatalyst for sustainable development, in mutually agreed areas of cooperation within \nthe framework of South-South and triangular cooperation, which is an important \ncomplement to, and not a substitute for, North-South cooperation.  \n31. We note the importance of economic, political and cultural ties at various levels \nas contributors to long-term regional prosperity, stability and peace.  \n32. We recognize that people, especially the large proportion of youth and working-\nage population in landlocked developing countries, are critical assets for their \ndevelopment. It is estimated that, between 2024 and 2034, the population in the \nlandlocked developing countries will increase by 135 million, to 726 million people. \nYoung people constitute a tremendous and essential asset worth investing in, opening \nthe door to an unparalleled multiplier effect.  \n33. We affirm that Governments play a very important role in articulating and \nimplementing the policies and programmes that will support a sustainable future that \nleaves no one behind. National parliaments have a great role to play in enacting \nlegislation and allocating funds that serve all in order to leave no one behind.  \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n7/48\n24-24446 \n \n34. The present Programme of Action will have five priority areas for action, as \nfollows:  \n \nPriority area 1: Structural transformation and science, technology and \ninnovation  \n \nPriority area 2: Trade, trade facilitation and regional integration  \n \nPriority area 3: Transit, transport and connectivity  \n \nPriority area 4: Enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and \nreducing vulnerability to climate change and disasters \n \nPriority area 5: Means of implementation.  \n35. The fulfilment of commitments in these areas will be supported through \nadditional dedicated actions on implementation, follow-up and monitoring.  \n \nPriority area 1: Structural transformation and science, technology \nand innovation \n36. We recognize that the landlocked developing countries face major structural \nimpediments to their sustainable development, including weak productive and supply \ncapacities and lack of advancement in science, technology and innovation.  \n37. We are concerned that many landlocked developing countries have achieved \nlimited economic diversification, remained dependent on a few commodities, and \ncontinued to be positioned at the lower ends of regional and global value chains.  \n38. We note with concern that the landlocked developing countries have been among \nthe worst affected by multiple and interlinked global crises, including the COVID\u201119 \npandemic and its lingering effects, climate change, and geopolitical tensions and \nconflicts in different parts of the world, which have derailed their progress toward \nstructural transformation and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.  \n39. We recognize that structural transformation that prioritizes economic \ndiversification, especially by promoting value addition and industrialization, and \nleveraging the power of science, technology and innovation, is critical to support the \nlandlocked developing countries to overcome their unique challenges, build resilience \nagainst current and possible future shocks and hazards, and achieve their development \nambitions.  \n \nI. \nProductive capacity development  \n40. We recognize that many landlocked developing countries have weak productive \ncapacities that constrain their ability to foster technology spillovers across sectors, to \nproduce efficiently and effectively, to diversify their economies, and to create \nproductive and sustainable employment.  \n41. We emphasize that sustainable agricultural production, food security, nutrition \nand food safety are key elements for the eradication of poverty in all its forms and \ndimensions.  \n42. We also recognize that agriculture remains crucial to the economies of the \nlandlocked developing countries, accounting on average for 17 per cent of their gross \ndomestic product and the employment of approximately 55 per cent of their \nworkforce, and note that the sector struggles with low productivity, vulnerability, high \ninformality, due to limited access to quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient \ninfrastructure, underdeveloped supply chain systems, limited value addition and a \nlack of access to and utilization of modern technologies.  \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n8/48 \n \n43. We are also concerned that the services sector of the landlocked developing \ncountries remains concentrated in lower value-added activities and with limited \nknowledge-intensive services.  \n44. We recognize the importance of further development of human capital as a \ncritical factor in the utilization of all other productive capacities. The landlocked \ndeveloping countries need more support to increase the access of their people, \nparticularly women and the youth, to quality education and training to improve labour \nproductivity and meet evolving skills needs.  \n45. We recognize that the landlocked developing countries need enhanced support \nfrom development partners to further develop their productive capacities, including \nthrough support for science, technology and innovation, labour productivity and \nentrepreneurial capabilities, the specialization of sectors, enterprises and farms, and \ncapital and resource accumulation.  \n46. We also recognize the importance of the creative economy in implementing the \n2030 Agenda for all countries, including for landlocked developing countries, and the \nneed for supporting actions undertaken nationally and internationally to secure the \nrecognition of the true value of creative economy.  \n47. Acknowledging that pursuing circular economy approaches as a pathway to \nachieving sustainable consumption and production patterns, and encouraging \napproaches such as the circular economy, life cycle and other approaches, as well as \nzero-waste initiatives, can contribute to addressing climate change, biodiversity loss, \nland degradation and the impact of water scarcity, pollution and the impact thereof on \nhuman health, thus contributing to the achievement of related goals under the 2030 \nAgenda and other internationally agreed environmental goals.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Increase labour productivity and decent employment opportunities across all \nproductive sectors of the landlocked developing countries, including \nmanufacturing, services and agriculture, with a particular focus on women and \nyouth, by 50 per cent by 2034.  \n \n\u2022 Double the output of services sectors in landlocked developing countries by \n2034, especially tourism and high-productivity, knowledge-intensive sectors, \nwith a view to increasing their contribution to the economies of the landlocked \ndeveloping countries.  \n \n\u2022 Establish regional agriculture research hubs to support the efforts of landlocked \ndeveloping countries in promoting sustainable agriculture sectors to be financed \nexclusively by voluntary contributions.  \n \n\u2022 Ensure increased access to inclusive, equitable and quality education, training and \nskills development, including science, technology, engineering and mathematics \neducation, with a particular focus on bridging the digital divides, including the \ngender digital divide.  \n \n\u2022 Promote targeted technological and financial support and capacity-building for \nlandlocked developing countries to facilitate a smooth digital transformation for \nsustainable development.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n48. We commit to promoting and supporting the formulation of national strategies \nfor structural transformation, decent employment, diversification, value addition, and \nefficiency and competitiveness in the manufacturing, agriculture and services sectors, \nand call for enhancing financial and technical support from all stakeholders.  \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n9/48\n24-24446 \n \n49. We call for increased public and private investment, including through \ninternational cooperation, in education and training, to reap demographic dividends, \nbridge technology gaps, bolster human capacity and skills and drive structural \ntransformation.  \n50. We commit to taking necessary measures to harmonize skills development and \ntraining programmes at the national and regional levels. We will utilize regional and \nglobal networking platforms to enhance collaboration in this regard among \nGovernments, businesses, educational institutions and others.  \n51. We commit to enhancing support to the landlocked developing countries for \ngreater investment in rural infrastructure and research and development, accelerated \nadoption of modern sustainable agricultural practices, more effective use of inputs \nand the facilitation of better access to credit and insurance mechanisms.  \n52. We call for greater efforts to sustainably enhance the agricultural production \ncapacities, productivity and food security of landlocked developing countries.  \n53. We commit to improving access to agricultural research and sustainable \ninnovation practices for landlocked developing countries, including through \nagroecological and other innovative approaches and sustainable technologies.  \n54. We commit to exploring the establishment of regional agricultural research hubs \nfor landlocked developing countries with a view to addressing structural \nimpediments, enhancing agricultural productivity, promoting value addition, \nsupporting capacity-building and facilitating improved agricultural practices. We \nrequest the Secretary-General to explore the feasibility, effectiveness and \nadministrative modalities of such network hubs and report to the General Assembly \nat its eightieth session.  \n55. We encourage landlocked developing countries to create conducive policy \nenvironments for industrial diversification and value addition, including by building \ninstitutional and human capacities and supporting knowledge development. We \nsupport improving high-quality, timely and reliable data collection, including \ndisaggregated data, to better understand productivity levels and trends and better \ninform policies to drive productivity shifts.  \n56. We encourage innovative solutions, entrepreneurship and the use of modern, \nsustainable, cost-effective technologies and practices, with an emphasis on the \nmanufacturing, agriculture and services sectors, including tourism, information and \ncommunications technologies and finance.  \n57. We encourage the promotion of the inclusion and mainstreaming of the creative \neconomy into economic policy, as well as in national and international development \nplans and strategies, and will assess, examine and explore the opportunities for new \nand emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, to promote sustainable \ndevelopment in its three dimensions in and through the creative economy, as well as \naddress their risks and challenges.  \n58. We call upon the landlocked developing countries to integrate circular economy \napproaches into national and regional strategies and action plans, taking into account \nnational circumstances and capacities, enhancing circular economy as a contribution \nto achieving sustainable consumption and production.  \n59. We call upon the landlocked developing countries to implement science-based, \nevidence-based and data-driven agricultural practices that increase resilience and \nsustainable productivity, help to maintain ecosystems, strengthen capacity for \nadaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters, \nimprove food security and reduce malnutrition in all its forms.  \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n10/48 \n \n60. We commit to promoting fair market opportunities and full and equal access to \nfinancial services and products for landlocked developing countries to create \nsustainable growth and decent jobs, including for women and young people, through \ntheir beneficial integration into national, regional and global value chains.  \n61. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries through facilitating \nand contributing to responsible and sustainable investments to achieve deeper value \nchain integration and industrialization for critical materials in order to address their \nneeds and competitiveness and become important links in production and distribution \nchains.  \n62. We commit to promoting collaboration throughout the minerals value chain, \nincluding critical minerals, and innovative approaches within the mining industry and \nlocal value addition of raw material to accelerate sustainable and inclusive \ndevelopment, including in line with Sustainable Development Goals 8 and 9 in the \ncontext of poverty eradication.  \n63. We commit to designing and providing support to landlocked developing \ncountries for designing and implementing programmes in adopting clean technologies \nand in building their adaptation and mitigation capabilities in relation to the impact \nof climate change and disasters.  \n \nII. \nPrivate sector development  \n64. We recognize that a dynamic and environmentally and socially responsible \nprivate sector can invaluably contribute to achieving structural transformation and \nsustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth, and in this regard stress the \nimportance of developing the necessary policies and regulatory frameworks and of \nstrengthening enabling environments.  \n65. We note that a large proportion of enterprises in landlocked developing countries \nare micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, which have specific needs and \nchallenges.  \n66. We note that structural constraints, such as high operating and trading costs, \nlimited access to finance, skill shortages, inadequate regulatory frameworks, limited \ninstitutional capacity and insufficient infrastructure, hinder dynamic entrepreneurship \nand private sector growth in these countries.  \n67. We recognize that the landlocked developing countries need increased support \nfor private sector development and that science, technology and innovation can help \nstart-ups and enterprises to enhance their productivity and competitiveness, and move \nup the value chain ladder in agriculture, industry and the services sector, and increase \nto their trade potential.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Enhance business ecosystems conducive to private sector development in \nlandlocked developing countries.  \n \n\u2022 Broaden and diversify the entrepreneurial base of landlocked developing \ncountries to better include women and the youth and accelerate their inclusive \ndevelopment, including through targeted technical support.  \n \n\u2022 Provide landlocked developing countries with financial and technical support, \nas appropriate, to develop and manage special economic zones, industrial parks, \ninnovation hubs or other innovative initiatives to foster economic productivity.  \n \n\u2022 Provide necessary technical support and capacity development for contract \nnegotiations for extractive industries in landlocked developing countries.  \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n11/48\n24-24446 \n \n \n\u2022 Expand support for policy formulation and international tax cooperation in \nlandlocked developing countries. \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n68. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries to create \nentrepreneurship policies, institutional frameworks, export strategies and optimal \nnational business climates, to facilitate the growth of start-ups and micro-, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, including women-owned micro-, small and medium-sized \nenterprises. We also commit to supporting landlocked developing countries in the \ndevelopment of policy measures to develop sustainable digital infrastructures, \nincluding those related to enhancing financial inclusion and enabling the private \nsector to take full advantage of the opportunities created by e-commerce and the \ndigital economy in an equitable manner, including micro-, small and medium-sized \nenterprises.  \n69. We commit to supporting the establishment of special economic zones, \nindustrial parks, technology incubators, innovation hubs or other innovative \ninitiatives in landlocked developing countries by mobilizing multi-stakeholder \nsupport, including for policy formulation, targeted investments, infrastructure \ndevelopment and conducive business ecosystems for the growth and sustainability of \nsuch initiatives.  \n70. We also commit to supporting the landlocked developing countries to establish \nregulatory frameworks and guidelines, including with provisions on local content, \nlabour and technology transfer on mutually agreed terms in order to improve \nresponsibility and accountability of multinational corporations.  \n71. We commit to promoting the development of intellectual property rights that \nreward innovation.  \n72. We commit to developing inclusive and competitive value chains by further \nstrengthening backward and forward linkages, economic diversification and \nleveraging the demographic dividend, with a view to creating full employment and \ndecent jobs in landlocked developing countries.  \n73. We commit to fostering cross-sectoral linkages between tourism, agriculture and \nthe creative or cultural sectors. We will also promote collaboration and partnership \nbetween start-ups, micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises and larger enterprises \nto foster national and regional value chains, strengthen domestic supply capacities \nand open up more opportunities for start-ups and micro-, small and medium-sized \nenterprises.  \n74. We commit to supporting a multi-stakeholder approach for private sector \ndevelopment in landlocked developing countries, including by establishing measures \nto enhance cooperation between government, the private sector and academic \ninstitutions and research centres.  \n75. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries with strengthening \nand simplifying transfer pricing protections, improving tax treaty practices. \n76. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries in implementing \ntargeted policy actions to reduce profit shifting with the aim of limiting tax revenue \nlosses.  \n77. We will support landlocked developing countries, upon their request, for project \npreparation and contract negotiation, and review of existing contracts in extractive \nindustries, in particular those related to critical minerals.  \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n12/48 \n \n78. We also encourage landlocked developing countries to strengthen data \ncollection, including disaggregated data, to generate better insights for the promotion \nof sustainable entrepreneurship and to monitor and evaluate progress.  \n \nIII. Science, technology and innovation  \n79. We note that the surge of digitalization and a \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d have \nbrought renewed emphasis on access to and capacity to develop and use modern and \ndigital technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics and \nbig data, as key drivers of industrialization, structural transformation and sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n80. We note with concern that the benefits of digital technologies have not been \nevenly spread across and within landlocked developing countries, which are still \nstruggling to leverage the power of science, technology and innovation due to stark \ngaps in the areas of infrastructure, regulations, policies, enforcement capabilities and \ninstitutions, and digital skills.  \n81. We are concerned that the proportion of individuals using the Internet in \nlandlocked developing countries was only 32.3 per cent in 2021, compared to the \nworld average of 66 per cent, and that substantially more progress is required to \nachieve universal information and communications technology connectivity in \nlandlocked developing countries.  \n82. We are also concerned that Internet use among women is 9 per cent lower than \namong men in landlocked developing countries as of 2023.  \n83. We are further concerned that the share of research and development expenditure \nin the gross domestic product of the landlocked developing countries was stagnant at \n0.2 per cent, markedly below the world average of 1.8 per cent, and that annual patent \napplications filed by residents of landlocked developing countries declined \nsignificantly, from 2,764 to 929, between 2014 and 2021.  \n84. We note that the COVID\u201119 pandemic has accelerated some trends, such as the \ngrowing relevance of e-governance and e-commerce, underscoring the pressing need \nfor the landlocked developing countries to elevate the application of science, \ntechnology and innovation and digital solutions at both policy and operational levels.  \n85. We recognize the efforts for further investments in digital ecosystems in the \nlandlocked developing countries to enable their integration into regional and global \nmarkets.  \n86. We recognize the need to promote safe, secure and trustworthy artificial \nintelligence systems in the non\u2011military domain to accelerate progress towards the \nfull realization of the 2030 Agenda, further bridging the artificial intelligence and \nother digital divides between and within countries. We stress the need for the standard \nof safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems to promote, not hinder, \ndigital transformation and equitable access to their benefits in order to achieve all 17 \nSustainable Development Goals and sustainable development in its three dimensions \u2013 \neconomic, social and environmental \u2013 and address other shared global challenges, \nparticularly for developing countries, and we further recognize that artificial \nintelligence can contribute to the long-term development aspirations of the landlocked \ndeveloping countries.  \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n13/48\n24-24446 \n \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Substantially increase investment from all sources in research and development, \nand in building accessible, reliable and affordable digital infrastructure, \nincluding for e-learning, e-governance and e-commerce in landlocked developing \ncountries.  \n \n\u2022 Promote the development of effective, balanced, open, inclusive and enabling \necosystems for research, innovation and creativity.  \n \n\u2022 Establish regional digital platforms for peer-to-peer level learning, trainings and \ncapacity-building.  \n \n\u2022 Support landlocked developing countries in accessing technologies and in \nconducting technology needs assessments, including using existing science, \ntechnology and innovation mechanisms and facilities.  \n \n\u2022 Strengthen or establish centres of science, technology and innovation, especially \non research and development to promote local innovations, research, design and \ndevelopment, including in emerging technologies, and enhance digital literacy \nand proficiency, including in advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and \nautomation technologies, to harness opportunities and optimize the use of new \nand emerging technology.  \n \n\u2022 Increase action to bridge the artificial intelligence and other digital divides \nbetween and within countries.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n87. We will take action to enhance the ability of landlocked developing countries to \nbenefit from science, technology and innovation and address the major structural \nimpediments to accessing new and emerging technologies, including through scaling \nup the use of open science, affordable and open-source technology, research and \ndevelopment, including through strengthened partnerships.  \n88. We commit to expanding participation of landlocked developing countries in the \ndigital economy, including by enhancing their digital infrastructure connectivity, \nbuilding their capacities and access to technological innovations through stronger \npartnerships and improving digital literacy and skills.  \n89. We commit to supporting the landlocked developing countries to leverage the \npower of science, technology and innovation to increase value addition and \nproductivity in the manufacturing, agricultural and services sectors, with the aim of \nachieving equitable, inclusive and sustainable growth.  \n90. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries to develop national \nresearch and innovation funds to support joint research and development projects \nbetween private businesses and public entities. We also commit to supporting the \nlandlocked developing countries in establishing national research centres and \nenhancing the capacities of their existing national research centres and of knowledge \nhubs.  \n91. We recognize the need to adopt science, technology and innovation strategies \nfor landlocked developing countries as integral elements of national sustainable \ndevelopment plans and strategies that help to strengthen knowledge-sharing and \ncollaboration, scale up investment in science, technology, engineering and \nmathematics education, and enhance technical, vocational and tertiary education and \ntraining, including in a gender-responsive manner. \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n14/48 \n \n92. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries by exploring \ncomplementarities with existing open digital platforms and to develop tools with a \nregional focus for peer-to-peer level learning, trainings and capacity-building.  \n93. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries in the development \nof digital governance frameworks such as e-governance, digital public infrastructures \nand public regulatory capacities to promote comprehensive digital strategies that \nutilize and strengthen open-source approaches, build resilience, bridge digital divides, \nincluding the gender digital divide, promote equitable, inclusive and sustainable \neconomic growth and create jobs in the digital sector.  \n94. We commit to strengthened intraregional and international cooperation for \nsupport to landlocked developing countries, including with relevant United Nations \nagencies, to harness the benefits of science, technology and innovation for structural \ntransformation, including through the Technology Facilitation Mechanism and the \nBroadband Commission for Sustainable Development and by promoting financial \ninvestments from all sources.  \n95. We recognize the challenges of landlocked developing countries and commit to \nsupporting them in accessing technologies and underline the need to support them in \nconducting technology needs assessments; building their scientific and technological \ncapacities; \npromoting \nknowledge-sharing \nand \nnetworking; \nfostering \nentrepreneurship, \ntechnology \nexchange \nand \ninnovation; \nfacilitating \npolicy \ndevelopment and implementation; and strengthening an innovative ecosystem. We \nalso underline the need to prioritize supporting landlocked developing countries \nthrough the existing mechanisms and facilities, including the Technology Bank for \nthe Least Developed Countries, as appropriate.  \n96. We call upon development partners to support technological upgrading and \nimprovements to the science, technology and innovation ecosystem in landlocked \ndeveloping countries, and to promote technology transfer on mutually agreed terms, \nincluding by building local technological capability sufficient to adopt and assimilate \nnew and frontier technologies, including artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, \nmachine learning and networks.  \n97. We call upon development partners, as well as all relevant stakeholders, to take \naction to help to bridge the artificial intelligence and other digital divides in \nlandlocked developing countries.  \n98. We commit to support landlocked developing countries in developing and \nstrengthening national digital strategies, meaningful digital connectivity, skills \ndevelopment, national regulatory frameworks and a conducive regional and global \nenvironment.  \n \nIV. Industrialization  \n99. We recognize that industrialization is a crucial driver of economic growth, job \ncreation and value addition in landlocked developing countries, with spillover effects \non agriculture, rural economies and on fostering demand for high value-added goods \nand services. We also acknowledge the contribution of science, technology and \ninnovation to industrial development in landlocked developing countries and as a \ncritical source of economic growth, economic diversification and value addition. We \nnote with concern that most of the landlocked developing countries have been unable \nto sufficiently industrialize and integrate into regional and global markets. We also \nnote that the manufacturing value added remained stagnant at between 12 and 13 per \ncent of gross domestic product and that medium and high-tech industries accounted \nfor an average of only 14.5 per cent of manufacturing value added in landlocked \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n15/48\n24-24446 \n \ndeveloping countries during the period of implementation of the Vienna Programme \nof Action.  \n100. We recognize that the stagnant economic performance of the landlocked \ndeveloping countries highlights the pressing need for strategic interventions to boost \nindustrial development in these countries. The landlocked developing countries need \ncountry-specific industrial policies to ensure that their industrial development goes \nhand in hand with rural and agricultural development, and growth in the \nmanufacturing and services sectors.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Double the contribution of manufacturing value added to the gross domestic \nproduct of the landlocked developing countries by 2034.  \n \n\u2022 Double the share of medium and high-tech manufacturing in the total value \nadded in manufacturing of the landlocked developing countries by 2034.  \n \n\u2022 Provide adequate support to landlocked developing countries to adopt proactive, \nequitable, inclusive and sustainable industrial policies, in support of their \nnational priorities.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n101. We encourage the landlocked developing countries to adopt proactive industrial \npolicy frameworks, considering the changing nature of production and sectoral \ninterdependencies, and to enhance productive capacities and collaboration with \nrelevant stakeholders, with a particular focus on rural industrialization, and \nprogressive formalization of the informal sectors and mainstreaming a gender \nperspective in industrial development cooperation and entrepreneurship. \n102. We urge development partners to support the landlocked developing countries \nin strengthening strategic coherence between trade and investment policies, and \nindustrial policy objectives.  \n103. We urge development partners to provide enhanced financial and technical \nassistance and capacity-development support to landlocked developing countries for \ntargeted industrial development programmes and projects and investment in the \nmanufacturing sector to promote value addition, diversification of their production \nand export base, innovation and greater use and adaptation of technology.  \n \nPriority area 2: Trade, trade facilitation and regional integration \nI. \nInternational trade  \n104. We recognize that international trade offers extraordinary opportunities for \nachieving economic growth, job creation and sustainable development. However, \nlandlocked developing countries are not able to harness their potential of international \ntrade owing in particular to a lack of territorial access to the sea, remoteness from \nworld markets and high transit costs and risks. These factors have severely \nconstrained the ability of landlocked developing countries to benefit from the gains \nof trade to enhance their socioeconomic development.  \n105. We recognize that international trade is critically important for the landlocked \ndeveloping countries, accounting for a higher share of their gross domestic product \nthan the world average. We therefore seek to seize the transformative potential of \ntrade for sustainable economic growth by significantly increasing the participation of \nlandlocked developing countries in global trade.  \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n16/48 \n \n106. We are concerned that the landlocked developing countries\u2019 share in global \nmerchandise exports was just 1.1 per cent of global trade in 2022, despite the \nlandlocked developing countries representing 7 per cent of the world\u2019s population.  \n107. We are concerned that the export structure of many landlocked developing \ncountries is characterized by a limited number of products, which often have low \nvalue addition and are greatly affected by external shocks and hazards, noting that \nprimary commodities accounted for 83 per cent of the exports of the landlocked \ndeveloping countries in 2022.  \n108. We recognize that trade in services, digital trade and e-commerce have great \npotential for overcoming the geographical constraints to trade in landlocked \ndeveloping countries. We are therefore concerned that the landlocked developing \ncountries\u2019 share of global exports of services reached only 0.7 per cent in 2022, while \ntheir share of digitally deliverable services reached only 0.3 per cent in 2022.  \n109. We recognize that continued support from the international community is \ncritical to assist the efforts of the landlocked developing countries to extract, add \nvalue to and export their abundant resources of critical minerals.  \n110. We acknowledge a need for trade capacity-building for landlocked developing \ncountries, including in the areas of trade policy formulation and trade negotiation \nskills.  \n111. We underline the importance of the promotion of a rules-based, non\u2011discriminatory, \nopen, fair, inclusive, equitable and transparent multilateral trading system for \nlandlocked developing countries, with the World Trade Organization at its core, as \nwell as meaningful trade liberalization.  \n112. We note that 26 out of 32 landlocked developing countries are World Trade \nOrganization members. Meanwhile, six landlocked developing countries are at \ndifferent stages of the accession process.  \n113. We acknowledge the importance of dedicated sessions on transit at the \nCommittee on Trade Facilitation. We welcome that the Thirteenth Ministerial \nConference of the World Trade Organization instructed the Committee on Trade and \nDevelopment to hold focused sessions, to assess trade-related challenges identified \nfor the fuller integration of landlocked developing countries into the multilateral \ntrading system.  \n114. We recognize that landlocked developing countries need assistance from \ndevelopment partners to further scale up their legal and technical capacity to comply \nwith sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade, including \nfor goods in transit. \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Support landlocked developing countries to significantly increase participation \nin world trade with a view to at least doubling their global merchandise exports \nby 2034.  \n \n\u2022 Support landlocked developing countries to substantially diversify trade by \nincreasing the value added and manufactured component of their exports and \nexpanding their exports of services and e-commerce.  \n \n\u2022 Support landlocked developing countries to substantially increase exports of \nservices with a view to at least doubling their exports of trade in services by \n2034.  \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n17/48\n24-24446 \n \n \n\u2022 Address non\u2011tariff measures and reduce or eliminate arbitrary or unjustified \nnon\u2011tariff barriers, that is, those that are not in conformity with the rules of the \nWorld Trade Organization.  \n \n\u2022 Be transparent in taking sanitary and phytosanitary measures on goods in transit \nin accordance with World Trade Organization rules.  \n \n\u2022 Offer appropriate technical assistance and capacity-building to landlocked \ndeveloping countries to complete the process of their accession to the World \nTrade Organization, fulfil their commitments and integrate into the multilateral \ntrading system.  \n \n\u2022 Take note of landlocked developing countries\u2019 ambition to establish a work \nprogramme under the World Trade Organization.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n115. We commit to supporting the implementation of national trade strategies, \npolicies and measures in the landlocked developing countries, including through \ninvestments in non\u2011traditional sectors and strengthening efforts towards the increased \nprovision of development assistance and Aid for Trade, with a view to significantly \nincreasing value addition and diversification in the exports of the landlocked \ndeveloping countries.  \n116. We commit to promoting policies to improve the business environment and \nassist national firms, especially micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, \nincluding through support to women-owned micro-, small and medium-sized \nenterprises, to participate better in international trade, including by, where \nappropriate, strengthening institutions that support trade, fostering access to credit \nand trade competitiveness, building spaces for private-public dialogue, fostering \ntechnical and vocational education and training and capacity-building, and creating \nmarket linkages through business-to-business platforms.  \n117. We support the efforts of commodity-dependent landlocked developing \ncountries to address the factors that create structural barriers to international trade and \nimpede diversification and encourage their beneficiation of primary commodities.  \n118. We invite development partners to support landlocked developing countries \nthrough capacity-building, to be able to comply with sanitary and phytosanitary \nmeasures and technical standards, including, as appropriate, through the Standards \nand Trade Development Facility. \n119. We commit to supporting the landlocked developing countries in their efforts to \nharness the benefits of trade in services and services-facilitated trade.  \n120. We encourage development partners and all other relevant stakeholders to work \nwith landlocked developing countries to further facilitate trade in services in those \nsectors of interest to the landlocked developing countries.  \n121. We commit to supporting favourable conditions for the development of digital \ntrade and e-commerce in landlocked developing countries by addressing the \nfundamental challenges of inadequate digital infrastructures, underdeveloped legal \nand regulatory frameworks and limited digital skills, by considering the specific needs \nand challenges of landlocked developing countries in relevant international trade \nnegotiations and by improving their capacity to effectively participate in negotiations \nin these areas.  \n122. We commit to export-led growth in the developing countries through, inter alia, \npreferential trade access for developing countries, targeted special and differential \ntreatment that responds to the development needs of individual countries, in particular \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n18/48 \n \nleast developed countries, and the elimination of trade barriers that are inconsistent \nwith World Trade Organization agreements.  \n123. We will address non\u2011tariff measures and reduce or eliminate arbitrary or \nunjustified non\u2011tariff barriers, that is, those that are not in conformity with the rules \nof the World Trade Organization. \n124. We urge development partners to enhance trade-related technical assistance to \nand capacity-building of landlocked developing countries to support their accession \nto the World Trade Organization, active participation in trade negotiations, structured \ndialogues and the resolution of disputes, and integration into the multilateral trading \nsystem.  \n125. We underline the landlocked developing countries\u2019 interest to have a work \nprogramme on their special needs under the auspices of the World Trade Organization \nand look forward to the outcome of the focused sessions of the Committee on Trade \nand Development. \n126. We encourage all countries to consider the specific needs and challenges of \nlandlocked developing countries in all international trade negotiations.  \n127. We urge all relevant organizations, including the United Nations Conference on \nTrade and Development, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the World \nCustoms Organization and the International Trade Centre, to provide specific support \ncommensurate with their relative competencies to the landlocked and transit \ndeveloping countries, including for export promotion, trade fairs, trade facilitation, \ne-commerce and the design and implementation of inclusive trade policies with \nspecific consideration of the interests of women, youth and people in vulnerable \nsituations.  \n128. We call upon States to ensure the normal functioning of open markets, global \nsupply chain connectivity and cross-border travel for essential purposes, and to \nenhance the sustainability and resilience of supply chains, in order to help landlocked \ndeveloping countries to address current and potential future shocks, hazards, \ndisasters, pandemics and emergencies.  \n129. We encourage the development and the implementation of inclusive trade \npolicies that can contribute to advancing gender equality and women\u2019s economic \nempowerment, which has a positive impact on economic growth and helps to reduce \npoverty. \n \nII. \nTrade facilitation  \n130. We recognize that trade facilitation has an important role to play in reducing \ntrade costs for the landlocked developing countries, noting that trade costs are \nestimated to be 30 per cent higher for landlocked than for coastal developing \ncountries, owing in part to the barriers and burdens of trading across a greater \nmultitude of borders.  \n131. We are concerned that the COVID\u201119 pandemic, which led to the closing of \nborders and the introduction of stringent border measures, as well as current \ngeopolitical tensions and conflicts, demonstrates the fragility of international supply \nchains and the challenges of ensuring unfettered, efficient and cost-effective access \nfor landlocked developing countries to and from world markets in times of crises.  \n132. We therefore strive to leverage trade facilitation for enhanced, predictable and \nresilient access to international markets, not just for the competitiveness of \nlandlocked developing countries but also to ensure access to critical goods necessary \nfor equitable socioeconomic outcomes.  \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n19/48\n24-24446 \n \n133. We emphasize the specific importance of the freedom of transit for landlocked \ndeveloping countries, in accordance with applicable rules of international law, as an \nessential condition for their connection to global and regional supply chains.  \n134. We recognize transport corridors as an effective tool for easing trade bottlenecks \nfor the landlocked developing countries by fostering collaboration along transit routes \nthat are also climate-resilient, and the development of facilities such as smart one stop \nborder posts, including through the development of interconnected and interoperable \ntransit procedures, standards and systems, and the design and financing of \nstrategically connected multimodal transport and logistics infrastructures.  \n135. We note that, while the current implementation rate of the Agreement on Trade \nFacilitation stands at 81.1 per cent for all developing countries, the implementation \nrate for landlocked developing countries was only 61.8 per cent as of November 2023.  \n136. We recognize the need to continue to support landlocked developing countries \nwith capacity-building in the areas of movement, release and clearance of goods, \nincluding goods in transit.  \n137. We welcome the decision of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference of the World \nTrade Organization for the Trade Facilitation Committee to hold a dedicated session \non transit issues annually until the next review of the Trade Facilitation Agreement is \ncompleted and call for the strengthening and continuation of these sessions.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Encourage simplification and streamlining of documentation and border \ncrossing procedures with the aim of substantially reducing port and border \ndelays and costs.  \n \n\u2022 Make tangible contributions to overcoming the burden of landlockedness to \ninternational trade by improving transit facilities and their efficiency with the \naim of reducing the time taken and the cost of clearing goods between and \nthrough transit countries.  \n \n\u2022 Support the active participation of landlocked developing countries in \nstandards-setting organizations involved in trade facilitation.  \n \n\u2022 Promote acceleration of full and effective implementation of the World Trade \nOrganization Agreement on Trade Facilitation in all landlocked developing \ncountries and transit countries.  \n \n\u2022 Support landlocked and transit developing countries in the area of trade \nfacilitation, in accordance with the Agreement on Trade Facilitation. \n \n\u2022 Substantially increase the implementation rate of the measures under the United \nNations Global Survey on Digital and Sustainable Trade Facilitation.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n138. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries and transit countries \nto improve their trade facilitation, including by harmonizing, simplifying and \nstandardizing their transit rules, documentation requirements, border crossing \nprocesses and customs procedures, in line with existing international standards and \nbest practices for customs, transit and the safety and security of transport chains, \nincluding through single windows and customs digitalization.  \n139. We reaffirm our commitment to unfettered, efficient and cost-effective access to \nand from the sea by all means of transport, on the basis of the freedom of transit, and \nother related measures, in accordance with applicable rules of international law.  \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n20/48 \n \n140. We encourage landlocked developing countries and transit countries to develop \nand strengthen transport corridors, including through streamlined border procedures, \nthe implementation of legal frameworks and transit rule policies, coordination on the \nalignment of transport infrastructure with corridor routes, improved data collection \nand the sharing of best practices between corridors, as appropriate.  \n141. We encourage stronger collaboration between the landlocked developing \ncountries and their neighbouring transit countries to collect data to monitor and \naddress cross-border trade and transit challenges effectively.  \n142. We encourage sharing best practices with landlocked developing countries in \ncustoms administration and border and corridor management and in the \nimplementation of trade facilitation policies at the global, regional and subregional \nlevels, including in close cooperation with the private sector.  \n143. We will support the digitalization of trade and customs procedures to establish \ninterconnectivity and ensure the fast and secure exchange of data and information \nconcerning cargo and means of transport, based on international standards and \ninstruments, while safeguarding data protection, and call for these systems to be \ninterconnected and interoperable so as to cover the full transit operation.  \n144. We encourage the development of multi-country customs transit guarantee \nschemes and recognize that such systems require close collaboration and commitment \namong participating countries.  \n145. We will strive to provide capacity-building support to landlocked developing \ncountries and transit developing countries to assist them in the implementation of the \nAgreement on Trade Facilitation, consistent with the Agreement.  \n146. We commit to strengthening support for capacity-building for landlocked \ndeveloping countries and transit countries in the ratification and effective \nimplementation of international conventions on trade and transport facilitation.  \n \nIII. Regional integration and cooperation  \n147. We recognize that the inclusive, equitable and affordable connectivity of \nlandlocked developing countries has an inevitable regional dimension, with much of \ntheir trade necessarily flowing from and through their regional partners and regional \nvalue chains.  \n148. We note that the cost of reaching international markets for landlocked \ndeveloping countries does not depend only on their geography, policies, infrastructure \nand administrative procedures, but also on those of neighbouring and transit countries.  \n149. We therefore seek to harness regional integration as one of the principal tools \nfor increasing the participation of the landlocked developing countries in international \ntrade.  \n150. We recognize the significant potential of regional economic integration and \ninterconnectivity to promote inclusive growth and sustainable development in \nlandlocked developing countries and reiterate our commitment to strengthening \nregional cooperation and regional trade agreements.  \n151. We welcome the considerable progress made in the negotiation and \nimplementation of regional and subregional trade agreements since the Vienna \nProgramme of Action, including the African Continental Free Trade Area, the \nEurasian Economic Union and the Regional and Comprehensive Economic \nPartnership, as well as initiatives such as the Single African Air Transport Market and \nthe Framework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-border Paperless Trade in Asia \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n21/48\n24-24446 \n \nand the Pacific. We recognize such initiatives as vehicles for integrating landlocked \ndeveloping countries into regional and global value chains.  \n152. We emphasize the need for regional integration to encompass cooperation \namong countries in a broader range of areas than just trade and trade facilitation, to \ninclude investment, research and development, and policies aimed at accelerating \nregional industrial development and inclusive, equitable and affordable regional \nconnectivity.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Increase regional and subregional trade with a view to seizing regional \nintegration as a tool for addressing the challenges of being landlocked and \nunlocking trade potentials of landlocked developing countries.  \n \n\u2022 Substantially increase the share of landlocked developing countries in \nintraregional trade. \n \n\u2022 Create provisions on transit trade within regional trade agreements.  \n \n\u2022 Support the exchange of best practices and knowledge between regional and \nsubregional trade agreements with the participation of landlocked developing \ncountries, with a view to deepening regional integration processes and \naccelerating integration of landlocked developing countries into the global \neconomy.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n153. We commit to supporting the strengthening and deepening of regional and \nsubregional integration arrangements, and their effective implementation, including \nthrough joint projects on transport, communication, digital and energy networks, the \nharmonization of regional policies and the sharing of best practices, and to supporting \nthe alignment of development assistance, and in particular regional Aid for Trade.  \n154. We will support the deepening of regional and subregional integration, in the \nareas of trade, transport and transit facilitation, through enhancing infrastructure \nconnectivity and facilitating the movement of cargo across borders.  \n155. We call for the specific treatment of trade transit and connectivity issues within \nregional and subregional trade frameworks and the strengthened participation of \nlandlocked developing countries in such arrangements.  \n156. We call for the development of regional value chains, including by urging the \ninternational community to align its preferential trade schemes and initiatives to \nencourage regional cumulation.  \n157. We will further strengthen, technical and financial assistance and capacity-\nbuilding to the landlocked developing countries and transit countries to support the \nlandlocked developing countries in advancing their regional integration efforts, \nincluding to help them to formulate and implement bankable regional infrastructure \ndevelopment projects, in cooperation with transit countries and partners.  \n158. We encourage the promotion of regional and South-South cooperation in \ndrawing lessons and technological catch-up, raising resources and the systematic \nexchange of knowledge and experiences for regional infrastructure development and \nintegration.  \n \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n22/48 \n \nPriority area 3: Transit, transport and connectivity \nI. \nTransit transport connectivity  \n159. We recognize that landlocked developing countries face special challenges \nassociated with their lack of direct territorial access to the sea and isolation from \nworld markets, and that their connectivity challenges are exacerbated by inadequate \ntransport infrastructure with missing links, poor logistics, dependence on their transit \nneighbours, and cumbersome transit and border requirements.  \n160. We emphasize the significance of declaring the United Nations Decade of \nSustainable Transport for the 10-year period beginning on 1 January 2026, in \nparticular for landlocked developing countries and transit countries, and look forward \nto an implementation plan for the Decade.  \n161. We are concerned that, despite improvements in transport infrastructure, \ninadequate physical infrastructure persists as a major obstacle to viable and \npredictable transit transport systems in landlocked developing countries, with \ntransport infrastructure remaining largely unconnected to regional networks, resulting \nin high transport, trade and travel costs for both goods and services.  \n162. We note that road networks are an important mode of transport for both freight \nand passengers to and from landlocked developing countries and so are concerned \nthat the road networks in landlocked developing countries fall short of the global \naverage for paved road density by nearly 200,000 kilometres.  \n163. We recognize that rail transport offers shorter, faster and more reliable \nadvantages over road transport, yet is undermined by missing links, ageing tracks and \ninadequate maintenance, and that an estimated 46,000 kilometres of railways would \nneed to be constructed for landlocked developing countries to reach the global average \nin railway density.  \n164. We express concern that, during the period of implementation of the Vienna \nProgramme of Action, four African landlocked developing countries were reported to \nhave no railways and that the African railway network, which is mostly situated in \nNorth and Southern Africa, has over 26,362 kilometres of missing links. In this \nconnection, we further regret that the infrastructure deficit and high cost of logistics \nconstitute major constraints to the economic growth of landlocked developing \ncountries and to the full realization of the African Continental Free Trade Area.  \n165. We recognize the potential of air transport for circumventing the impediments \ninherent in surface transport in landlocked developing countries, especially for \ntourism, which is one of the key sectors for economic growth in landlocked \ndeveloping countries, and are therefore concerned that their air transport connectivity \nfalls short of the world average due to a lack of investment and the limited expansion \nof affordable air transport services.  \n166. We are concerned that some challenges persist in the application of international \nlaw with respect to waterways, especially in relation to port infrastructure and \nnational regulations, and note the need for coordination between landlocked \ndeveloping countries and transit countries.  \n167. We underline that transit corridors should be considered as economic \ndevelopment corridors and as an important means for expediting the movement of \ngoods and people across international borders by connecting key freight transport \npoints in landlocked developing countries and transit countries, as well as other \ncountries in the region.  \n168. We recognize that transit transport corridors link hard infrastructure, including \nroads, rails, waterways, ports, airports and border posts, and soft infrastructure, such \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n23/48\n24-24446 \n \nas institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks, standards, operational and logistics \nservices and the use of technology, to improve connectivity for landlocked developing \ncountries. We note with concern that some landlocked developing countries have \ntransit corridors that lack established corridor management institutions and the \nnecessary legal frameworks to address institutional arrangements and implement \nharmonized and simplified procedures. \n169. We recognize the importance of transport and transit corridors in promoting \nurban-rural, intra- and inter-country connectivity in order to boost economic growth \nat the local and regional levels, promote interconnections between cities, peoples and \nresources and facilitate intraregional and interregional trade.  \n170. We note that dry ports can improve the logistics performance of landlocked \ndeveloping countries by increasing the efficiency of transport and logistics and by \nenabling a modal shift from roads to rail or inland waterways.  \n171. We acknowledge the concerns of landlocked developing countries that little \nprogress has been achieved in the implementation of Part X of the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea,12 on the right of access of landlocked States to and \nfrom the sea and freedom of transit, and article V of the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade of 1994 and section I, article 11, of the World Trade Organization \nAgreement on Trade Facilitation, on freedom of transit, in which the right of access \nof landlocked States, including landlocked developing countries, to and from the sea \nand freedom of transit is recognized.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Achieve unfettered, efficient and cost-effective access to and from the sea by all \nmeans of transport, on the basis of the freedom of transit in accordance with \napplicable rules of international law, especially Part X of the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea and section I, article 11, of the Agreement on \nTrade Facilitation.  \n \n\u2022 Develop resilient, sustainable, safe and smart transit infrastructure to fulfil \nSustainable Development Goal targets 9.1.2, 9.a and 3.9.  \n \n\u2022 Establish a high-level panel of experts with a view to identifying ways and \nmeans to ensure seamless access for the landlocked developing countries to and \nfrom the sea.  \n \n\u2022 Significantly expand, upgrade and maintain access to safe, affordable, \naccessible and sustainable transport infrastructure and national and cross-\nboundary connectivity, including through multimodal systems and closing the \nmissing links in regional infrastructure, while strengthening institutional \ncapacities to manage transport services.  \n \n\u2022 Develop standardized cross-border transport infrastructure and transit \nrequirements between landlocked developing countries and transit countries.  \n \n\u2022 Explore the establishment of an infrastructure investment finance facility for \nlandlocked developing countries.  \n \n\u2022 Aim to establish and strengthen the air transport system in landlocked \ndeveloping countries with the purpose of developing efficient transit systems, \nenhancing competitiveness, strengthening regional cooperation and expanding \ninternational trade.  \n_______________ \n \n12 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1833, No. 31363. \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n24/48 \n \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n172. We will strive to help landlocked developing countries to establish or maintain \nsafe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems, for example in the areas \nof rail transport, road transport, air transport, dry ports, waterways, pipelines and \ntransboundary power lines, to reduce transport costs, facilitate trade, link to regional \nand international markets and enhance competitiveness.  \n173. We urge landlocked developing countries to develop and implement \ncomprehensive national and local policies for safe, affordable, accessible and \nsustainable transport infrastructure development and maintenance, encompassing all \nmodes of transportation that take into account the needs of women and girls, persons \nwith disabilities, older persons and those in vulnerable situations.  \n174. We encourage landlocked developing countries and transit countries to pursue \nconnectivity-related bilateral agreements in line with regional and international legal \ninstruments, including those related to corridor development and management.  \n175. We call upon landlocked developing countries and transit countries to strengthen \ncollaboration towards the implementation of best practices in developing transit \ninfrastructure, including adopting international standards for the development of \ntransit infrastructure and the harmonization of gauges to facilitate transit and enhance \nconnectivity.  \n176. We commit to enhancing support to landlocked developing countries and transit \ncountries to develop corridors along transit highways, upgrade and maintain existing \nones, including by closing missing links, and encourage the use of information and \ncommunications technologies to increase the productivity of these corridors, improve \nsafety and facilitate the sharing of information among corridor member countries.  \n177. We request the Secretary-General to establish, within six months of the adoption \nof the present Programme of Action by the General Assembly, a high-level panel of \nexperts comprising Member States, relevant international organizations, the private \nsector, academia and independent experts, to examine the application of the existing \ninternational laws and agreements, identify constraints, and make recommendations \non the freedom of transit for landlocked developing countries in accordance with \napplicable rules of international law. We also request the Secretary-General to \ntransmit the report of the panel, along with its recommendations, to the Member States \nduring the eighty-first session of the General Assembly for its consideration. \n178. We commit to exploring the feasibility of establishing a dedicated infrastructure \ninvestment finance facility, building on the available financing facilities in this area, \nand we request the Secretary-General to elaborate on its feasibility and possible \nmodalities and submit a report to the General Assembly at its eightieth session for its \nconsideration.  \n179. We urge the regional development banks, the World Bank Group and relevant \nUnited Nations system organizations to provide additional financial and technical \nsupport to landlocked developing countries to facilitate the growth of ancillary \nindustries and small businesses around the corridors.  \n180. We further call upon the international community to support measures to \nimprove air transport connectivity in landlocked developing countries, including for \nboosting trade, tourism industry and job creation.  \n181. We request the International Civil Aviation Organization to build on its existing \ntechnical support and capacity-building programmes as well as financial assistance, \nas appropriate, to help landlocked developing countries to meet their identified \naviation needs.  \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n25/48\n24-24446 \n \n182. We commit to assisting landlocked developing countries to develop and \nmaintain railway networks, especially those landlocked developing countries that do \nnot have any railway infrastructure.  \n183. We commit to supporting the development and strengthening of the necessary \ninstitutional and legal frameworks for the establishment, management and \nmaintenance of transport corridors, including harmonized and seamless logistics as \nwell as standardizing vehicle loading, pavements design, signage and regulations \nacross corridor members.  \n184. We encourage landlocked developing countries to develop and maintain \nsustainable revenue generation mechanisms, including adopting toll systems, to raise \nrevenue for the maintenance of infrastructure and services along corridors. \n185. We encourage landlocked developing countries and their development partners \nto promote increased participation of the private sector to enhance the prospects of \ncreating more efficient, quality, resilient, reliable and sustainable transit transport \ninfrastructure.  \n186. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries in strengthening their \ninfrastructure financing capacity, including through development banks, development \nfinance institutions and tools and mechanisms such as public-private partnerships and \nblended finance.  \n187. We also commit to strengthening the capacity of landlocked developing \ncountries and transit countries to develop bankable transit and transport projects that \nare financially viable, environmentally friendly and accepted by the local \ncommunities, utilizing, among others, regional integration and approaches to attract \nfunding and enhance project viability and the existing multilateral mechanisms.  \n188. We commit to promoting the transfer of knowledge on infrastructure finance, \nproject preparation and implementation support, in the form of regional platforms, \nand open dialogues with project-related organizations and other stakeholders on how \nto develop bankable infrastructure projects and access innovative financing \nmechanisms. \n189. We encourage landlocked developing countries and transit countries to develop \nmultimodal transport networks in order to ease logistical challenges and reduce their \noverreliance on roads.  \n190. We note that cross-country and transboundary pipelines can be an energy-\nefficient and economical way to transport energy, including hydrocarbons and \nsustainable forms of energy, over long distances. We commit to continued \ninternational cooperation in promoting reliable and stable energy connectivity at the \nnational, regional and global levels to advance economic integration and sustainable \ndevelopment in landlocked developing countries, in particular, to achieve Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 7, on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and \nmodern energy for all. We also encourage efforts for resilient and secure cross-border \nenergy infrastructure and energy connectivity. \n191. We commit to helping landlocked developing countries to establish dry ports in \norder to enhance their interconnectivity, which will also catalyse flows of goods and \nservices and help to reduce transportation costs and total transit time, and further \nstimulate their economic growth.  \n \nII. \nDigital connectivity  \n192. We acknowledge that information and communications technologies, including \nhigh-speed broadband, promote economic development and recognize that \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n26/48 \n \novercoming the digital divides, both between and within countries and including the \nrural-urban, youth-older persons and gender digital divides, will help those living in \nlandlocked developing countries to leverage economic opportunities in a world that \nis increasingly online. \n193. We are concerned that the dependence of the landlocked developing countries \non land links through their neighbouring and costal countries for access to submarine \ncables and international Internet bandwidth raises the cost and reduces the quality of \ntheir Internet access.  \n194. We reaffirm that improving fair negotiation and competition can help to address \nthe challenges that hinder the access of landlocked developing countries to submarine \ncables and the high costs of their Internet.  \n195. We note that there are generally no harmonized regional regulations that \nestablish fair interconnection and termination arrangements between countries, \nresulting in bilateral negotiations between transit operators and landlocked \ndeveloping country operators, which can result in significantly high costs.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Significantly increase access to information and communications technologies \nand strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in \nlandlocked developing countries.  \n \n\u2022 Achieve universal access to the Internet by 2030 by expanding access to both \nsubmarine cables and other available sources, including satellite-based Internet \nconnectivity.  \n \n\u2022 Substantially increase investments from all sources in digital as well as human \nand institutional capacity-building with a view to improving digital transit and \ntransport infrastructure within an international enabling environment.  \n \n\u2022 Expand connectivity and digital transformation in landlocked developing \ncountries with a focus on but not limited to hardest-to-connect communities, \nincluding through the Partner2Connect initiative. \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n196. We encourage landlocked developing countries to strengthen and implement \nnational broadband policies with a view to improving access to international high-\ncapacity fibre-optic cables and high-bandwidth backbone networks to facilitate \naffordable, accessible and high-quality telecommunications services with the \noverarching goals of universal and affordable access to information and \ncommunications technologies.  \n197. We commit to developing and expanding the necessary information and \ncommunications technologies, including high-speed broadband, and digital \ninfrastructure as well as capacity-building for the use of modern and affordable \ncommunications \ntechnology, \nincluding \nby \nutilizing \nprogrammes \nsuch \nas \nPartner2Connect.  \n198. We commit to strengthening regulatory harmonization and the implementation \nand coordination of regional agreements to establish fair interconnection and \ntermination arrangements between countries and the implementation of standardized \nconnectivity systems.  \n199. We urge development partners to support landlocked developing countries, \nincluding through financial and technical assistance, in their efforts towards achieving \nuniversal access to the Internet, leveraging all available and cost-effective means, \nincluding through submarine cables and satellite-based Internet connectivity.  \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n27/48\n24-24446 \n \n200. We commit to enhancing the capacity of landlocked developing countries to \nmitigate threats and to ensure enhanced protection of their national critical \ninfrastructure, including critical information and communications technology \ninfrastructure, thereby increasing its resilience and making it more secure, including \nfor women and children, so that it can serve national priorities and maximize \nsocioeconomic benefits. We underline that the human rights that people have offline \nmust be protected online.  \n201. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries to increase \ninvestments in digital infrastructure and the expansion of their data centre capacity, \nincluding through innovative and emerging technologies, such as satellite \ntechnologies, as well as innovative approaches such as community networks to \nensuring meaningful connectivity.  \n \nIII. Energy \n202. We recognize that affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy \ninfrastructure, including cross-border infrastructure as well as energy transit and \nconnectivity infrastructure, is vital for achieving structural transformation and \nbuilding the productive capacities of landlocked developing countries and welcome \nthe progress made by landlocked developing countries towards increased access to \naffordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy in recent years.  \n203. We recognize that the transitions to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern \nenergy for all should be just, inclusive, equitable and secure, in line with national \ncircumstances.  \n204. We recognize the role that natural gas can play in supporting transitions towards \nlower-emission energy systems and call upon Governments to enhance and \ncollaborate on energy security, including through the sharing of best practices and \nknowledge for the security of gas supply and demand, in the broader context of the \ntransition towards lower-emission energy systems.  \n205. We note that, while progress has been made towards access to affordable, \nreliable, sustainable and modern energy in recent years, 215 million people in \nlandlocked developing countries still live without reliable energy, equivalent to about \n40 per cent of the population. The share of modern renewables in total final energy \nconsumption in the landlocked developing countries has progressed slowly and stood \nat 12 per cent in 2021.  \n206. We are further concerned by the large gap in access to electricity between urban \nareas and rural areas in landlocked developing countries, with 88 per cent and 46 per \ncent having access to electricity in 2020, respectively.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying \naffordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy services for all.  \n \n\u2022 Enhance technology development and transfer, on mutually agreed terms, to \nlandlocked developing countries to accelerate just, inclusive, equitable and \nsecure energy transitions in line with national circumstances.  \n \n\u2022 Recognize that transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy \ntransition while ensuring energy security.  \n \n\u2022 Achieve universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services for \nall in landlocked developing countries by 2030. \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n28/48 \n \n \n\u2022 Develop regional pooled energy systems and clear and measurable standards to \nharmonize electricity planning and operation of pooled energy systems in \nlandlocked developing countries.  \n \n\u2022 Scale up finance and targeted support for clean and renewable energy and \nenhance capacities in energy production, trade and distribution in the landlocked \ndeveloping countries. \n \n\u2022 Achieve universal clean cooking access by 2030, in line with Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 7. \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n207. We call upon landlocked developing countries to strengthen and adapt their \nnational energy policies to promote affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern \nenergy, with a view to significantly enhancing capacities in production, trade and \ndistribution and ensuring access to energy for all and the transformation of their \neconomies.  \n208. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries to strengthen their \ncapacities for planning, implementing and monitoring clean and renewable energy \npolicies and for developing bankable projects to leverage funding for energy projects.  \n209. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries to maintain existing \ninfrastructure, and expand and upgrade, as appropriate, for the supply, transmission \nand distribution of affordable, reliable and modern services for all in rural and urban \nareas.  \n210. We aim to provide financial and technical support to landlocked developing \ncountries to assist them in their objective to double the per capita generation of \nelectricity in landlocked developing countries by 2030 and increase substantially the \nshare of renewable energy in the energy mix.  \n211. We call upon landlocked developing countries to prioritize the development and \nimplementation of innovative energy projects by leveraging bilateral and regional \ncooperation and coordination for the development of energy superhighways and \nencourage the landlocked developing countries and transit countries to enhance their \ncollaboration in promoting cross-border energy trade and energy transit.  \n212. We commit to developing energy connectivity in landlocked developing \ncountries through pooled power systems and cross-border power grid connectivity to \nenhance electricity efficiency and access, promote innovation and facilitate financing, \nand in this regard encourage the harmonization of operational, planning, regulatory \nand financial procedures and the sharing of best practices.  \n213. We commit to supporting the efforts of landlocked developing countries in \nenhancing funding for developing innovative solutions relevant to the local context \nand in response to those countries\u2019 energy challenges in support of clean and \nrenewable energy and capacities in energy production, trade and distribution, in line \nwith Sustainable Development Goal 7.  \n214. We commit to creating enabling environments, including appropriate regulatory \nframeworks and policy reforms, to facilitate private sector investments, particularly \nin clean and renewable energy and capacities in energy production, trade and \ndistribution. \n215. We invite development partners, multilateral development banks and other \ninternational and regional organizations to substantially increase their investments for \ninfrastructure development in landlocked developing countries, including by \nstrengthening energy systems through cross-border grid connections, as appropriate, \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n29/48\n24-24446 \n \nand giving consideration to incorporating decentralized clean and renewable energy \nsolutions in energy planning, and recognizing that the energy transition will take \ndifferent pathways in different parts of the world.  \n216. We commit to prioritizing access to clean cooking, overcoming infrastructure \nbarriers, such as lack of access to electricity and clean fuels, and income barriers such \nas unaffordability, while addressing gender equality and relevant behavioural and \ncultural factors.  \n \nPriority area 4: Enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and \nreducing vulnerability to climate change and disasters \n217. We recognize that, while the total greenhouse gas emissions of the 32 landlocked \ndeveloping countries add up to only 1.9 per cent of global emissions, those countries \nare vulnerable to and remain negatively affected by the adverse impacts of climate \nchange, including desertification, deforestation, land degradation, droughts, \nheatwaves, wildfires, floods, melting mountain glaciers, glacier lake outburst floods \nand landslides. Approximately 54 per cent of landlocked developing countries\u2019 land \nis classified as dryland and 60 per cent of the population in those countries are located \nin these drylands. In addition, many of the landlocked developing countries are \nmountainous countries, making them more vulnerable to the impact of climate change \nand environmental degradation that is also exacerbated by climate change. However, \nlandlocked developing countries have limited institutional, technical and financial \ncapacities to tackle the challenges arising from the adverse impacts of climate change.  \n218. We are concerned that climate change and natural hazards have a severe impact \non landlocked developing countries, particularly on their lives and livelihoods, \neconomy, infrastructure, settlements and other assets. These impacts often come in \nsuccession and trigger secondary effects such as famine and disease outbreaks and \ncan exacerbate biodiversity loss. In arid and semi-arid areas, climate impacts on \nagricultural productivity may be compounded by limited water availability.  \n219. We encourage partnerships to strengthen the understanding of disaster risk, \nincluding the impacts of climate change and, more broadly, systemic risk and its \napplication in decision-making in landlocked developing countries, including through \ndisaster risk reduction education, comprehensive risk management, building \nacademic and scientific capacity, the utilization of frontier technologies and \nsupporting traditional, Indigenous and local knowledge and practices.  \n220. We note with concern that the current provision of climate finance for adaptation \nremains insufficient to respond to worsening climate change impacts in developing \ncountry parties, welcome the recent pledges made by many developed countries to \nincrease their provision of climate finance to support adaptation in developing \ncountries in response to their growing needs, including contributions made to the \nAdaptation Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Green Climate Fund, \nwhich represent significant progress compared with previous efforts, and recall that \nthe Glasgow Climate Pact urged developed countries to at least double their collective \nprovision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries from 2019 levels \nby 2025, in the context of achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation in \nthe provision of scaled-up financial resources, emphasized the urgency of scaling up \naction and support, including finance, capacity-building and technology transfer, to \nenhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate \nchange in line with the best available science, taking into account the priorities and \nneeds of developing country parties, and in that regard recognized the importance of \nthe global goal on adaptation for effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.  \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n30/48 \n \n221. We note the interest and commitment of the landlocked developing countries to \ndevelop a dedicated work programme on landlocked developing countries under the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n222. We note the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \nSea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas \nbeyond National Jurisdiction.13 \n223. We emphasize that landlocked developing countries are also home to certain \nminerals critical for just, sustainable and inclusive transitions and the opportunity that \nthese minerals offer to support economic diversification and inclusive economic \ngrowth, structural transformation and industrialization, and poverty and inequality \nreduction, while minimizing negative environmental and social impacts of minerals \ndevelopment in mineral-exporting landlocked developing countries.  \n224. We express appreciation that all parties to the Paris Agreement, including all \nlandlocked developing countries, have communicated nationally determined \ncontributions that demonstrate progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement \ntemperature goal, most of which provided the information necessary to facilitate \nclarity, transparency and understanding. \n225. We emphasize the need for accelerated implementation of domestic mitigation \nmeasures, including in landlocked developing countries, in line with the Paris \nAgreement.  \n226. We also emphasize the urgent need to strengthen integrated, holistic and \nbalanced non\u2011market approaches in accordance with article 6, paragraph 8, of the \nParis Agreement, in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, \nin a coordinated and effective manner, including through mitigation, adaptation, \nfinance, technology transfer and capacity-building, as appropriate.  \n227. We recognize that enhanced access to international climate finance is important \nto support mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries, especially those \nthat are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and also \nrecognize the ongoing efforts in this regard. \n \nI. \nAdaptation \n228. We emphasize that it is essential to scale up support to landlocked developing \ncountries and increase its effectiveness, to build resilience and strengthen adaptation \nplanning and implementation to address the worsening impacts of climate change, \nsafeguard progress on the Sustainable Development Goals and support the \nachievement of the other priority areas of the new Programme of Action.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Landlocked developing countries that have not yet done so to have in place \nnational adaptation plans, policies and planning processes by 2025 and to have \nprogressed in implementing them by 2030.  \n \n\u2022 Strengthen the support for the implementation of adaptation projects and \nprogrammes in landlocked developing countries, in line with the global goal on \nadaptation and the United Arab Emirates Framework for Global Climate \nResilience, as appropriate.  \n_______________ \n \n13 A/CONF.232/2023/4. \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n31/48\n24-24446 \n \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n229. We commit to support landlocked developing countries in their preparation and \nimplementation of national adaptation strategies to address their priorities, including \nthrough the formulation of national adaptation plans and the subsequent \nimplementation of the policies, programmes and projects therein, in line with the \nglobal goal on adaptation and the United Arab Emirates Framework for Global \nClimate Resilience, as appropriate.  \n230. We reaffirm our commitment to scale up support to landlocked developing \ncountries for the preparation and implementation of adaptation projects and the \ndevelopment of climate-resilient critical infrastructure such as transport, energy, \nhealth and educational facilities, water, electricity and information and \ncommunications technologies.  \n \nII. \nDisaster risk reduction  \n231. We note with concern that climate change is making natural hazards even more \nfrequent and intense. Landlocked developing countries are increasingly affected by \nfloods, heatwaves, storms, droughts and glacial lake outburst floods. A number of \nlandlocked developing countries are located in seismically active regions, with a high \nrisk of earthquakes and secondary hazards, such as landslides, which cause widescale \ndamage to infrastructure, property, health and sanitation, and loss of life. Landlocked \ndeveloping countries suffer disproportionately high human and economic losses from \ndisasters, which further compound the socioeconomic impacts of the recent \nCOVID\u201119 pandemic and other crises. Disasters, among other factors, impact \necosystems, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss.  \n232. We note with concern that, between 2013 and 2022, disaster mortality rates \naveraged 2.12 deaths annually per 100,000 population in reporting landlocked \ndeveloping countries, significantly higher than the global average of 1.15 per 100,000 \npopulation. Landlocked developing countries also accounted for 4.14 per cent of \nglobally reported economic losses between 2015 and 2022, while having only 1.05 per \ncent of the gross domestic product of reporting countries. We recognize that in 2022 \nonly 59 per cent of the landlocked developing countries reported having multi-hazard \nearly warning systems in place, which are among the most effective ways of reducing \nmortality and economic losses from natural hazards.  \n233. We reaffirm the importance of strong early warning systems for landlocked \ndeveloping countries\u2019 preparedness for disasters and the need for support in \nstrengthening early warning systems as well as the promotion of early action. To \nensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water or climate \nevents through life-saving early warning systems, as called for in the Early Warnings \nfor All initiative, special attention will need to be given to landlocked developing \ncountries due to their notable lack of early warning systems. We also underline the \nneed for the development, strengthening and implementation of local, national and \nregional strategies and platforms, to take action to achieve the priorities and targets \nof the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030.  \n234. We are deeply concerned that coverage of and accessibility to multi-hazard early \nwarning systems, in particular for people in vulnerable situations, remains inadequate \nand emphasize the need to urgently extend the reach of multi-hazard early warning \nsystems in landlocked developing countries, in particular by strengthening the means \nof implementation.  \n235. We recognize the need to increase investments in disaster risk reduction and \npreparedness in landlocked developing countries for the protection of lives and \nlivelihoods and ensure that integrated national financing frameworks are \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n32/48 \n \ncomprehensive; and encourage the allocation of more resources to ex-ante \ninstruments for building resilience, including new financing approaches which \nincentivize disaster risk reduction and sustainable reduction of landlocked developing \ncountries\u2019 vulnerabilities to disasters.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Reduce disaster risk in landlocked developing countries through urgent and full \nimplementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u2013\n2030, including the call to action contained in the political declaration of the \nhigh-level meeting on the midterm review of the Sendai Framework.14 \n \n\u2022 Embed disaster risk reduction at the core of development policies and \ninvestments for structural economic transformation in landlocked developing \ncountries.  \n \n\u2022 Develop and strengthen local, national and regional strategies and platforms for \ndisaster risk reduction to achieve the priorities for action and targets of the \nSendai Framework.  \n \n\u2022 Support and reinforce, as appropriate, the existing comprehensive multi-hazard \nearly warning systems and comprehensive multi-hazard crisis mitigation and \nresilience-building measures for landlocked developing countries.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n236. We commit to embedding disaster risk reduction at the core of development \npolicies and investments for structural economic transformation in landlocked \ndeveloping countries in all areas of the Programme of Action.  \n237. We commit to the strengthening of early warning systems to help landlocked \ndeveloping countries\u2019 preparedness for disasters, many of which are exacerbated by \nclimate change, and ensuring that landlocked developing countries are not left behind \namong the priority countries of the Secretary-General\u2019s Early Warnings for All \ninitiative.  \n238. We commit to carrying out multidimensional and comprehensive risk \nassessments, recognizing that implementation of the Sendai Framework can address \ndrivers of vulnerability and exposure to build resilience and reduce humanitarian \nimpacts and needs.  \n239. We call upon development partners to support the provision of adequate, \nsustainable and timely means of implementation through capacity-building, financial \nand technical assistance and transfer of technology, on mutually agreed terms, to \nlandlocked developing countries, to enhance the collection, analysis and \ndissemination of disaster-related data and strengthen the role of national statistical \nand planning offices.  \n240. We invite the private sector and insurance markets to support landlocked \ndeveloping countries to develop risk financing mechanisms and innovative and \nsustainable financing solutions, which increase the volume, efficiency and \neffectiveness of financial flows towards risk prevention at the local, national, and \nregional levels.  \n241. We invite the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group and other \nmultilateral and regional development banks to consider vulnerability and climate \nchange impacts in landlocked developing countries in their decision-making and debt \nsustainability analysis.  \n_______________ \n \n14 Resolution 77/289, annex. \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n33/48\n24-24446 \n \n242. We request development partners, relevant entities of the United Nations \nsystem, international financial institutions and development banks, as well as the \nprivate sector and foundations, to continue to support landlocked developing \ncountries in formulating and implementing national disaster risk reduction strategies \nto reduce risk and build resilience.  \n \nIII. Climate finance  \n243. We note that, while support and funding has been provided for climate change \nadaptation and mitigation in landlocked developing countries, including from the \nGlobal Environment Facility and the Green Climate Fund, there remain financing \nneeds.  \n244. We recognize that the Technology Mechanism composed of the Technology \nExecutive Committee and the Climate Technology Centre and Network, under the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, \nis critical in promoting and facilitating enhanced action in technology development \nand transfer to address climate change.  \n245. We recognize the role of the Paris Committee on Capacity-building as a means \nto address gaps and needs in implementing and further enhancing capacity-building \nin countries in special situations, including the landlocked developing countries, for \naddressing climate action.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Mobilize an increased amount of adaptation finance to landlocked developing \ncountries.  \n \n\u2022 Scale up capacity-building and technology transfer to landlocked developing \ncountries to address climate change.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n246. We recall that article 9, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement provides that \ndeveloped country parties shall provide financial resources to assist developing \ncountry parties with respect to both mitigation and adaptation in continuation of their \nexisting obligations under the Convention.  \n247. We also recall that article 9, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement provides that \nother parties are encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support \nvoluntarily.  \n248. We further recall that article 9, paragraph 3, of the Paris Agreement provides \nthat, as part of a global effort, developed country parties should continue to take the \nlead in mobilizing climate finance from a wide variety of sources, instruments and \nchannels, noting the significant role of public funds, through a variety of actions, \nincluding supporting country-driven strategies, and taking into account the needs and \npriorities of developing country parties. Such mobilization of climate finance should \nrepresent a progression beyond previous efforts.  \n249. We reaffirm our commitment to provide information on financial, technology \ntransfer and capacity-building support provided to landlocked developing countries \nin line with the Paris Agreement.  \n250. We commit to continuing and striving for increased support, such as for \ncapacity-building for adaptation planning and implementation in landlocked \ndeveloping countries, in order to address medium- and long-term adaptation needs \nthrough the formulation of national adaptation plans and subsequent implementation \nof the policies, programmes and projects identified by them.  \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n34/48 \n \n251. We commit to continue supporting the Climate Technology Centre and Network \nResource Mobilization and Partnership Strategy for 2023\u20132027 to address the climate \nchange-related technology needs of developing countries, including landlocked \ndeveloping countries.  \n252. We urge relevant United Nations system organizations and other international \nand regional development and financial institutions to provide capacity-building \nsupport to landlocked developing countries to enhance investment in projects that \ncontribute to climate action in all sectors.  \n \nIV. Resilient infrastructure development  \n253. We note that disasters, many of which are exacerbated by climate change, \nweaken infrastructure, including railroads, roads, hydroelectric plants and other \nenergy infrastructure, housing, schools, hospitals and other health facilities and public \nbuildings; impact communication routes, such as international waterways, which are \nessential for trade, energy and transportation; and impose a direct cost on transit trade, \nwhich consequently limits the sustainable development efforts in landlocked \ndeveloping countries and their ability to compete in global markets.  \n254. We note that quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure has the \npotential to promote sustainable development in landlocked developing countries and \navoid regresses through damages and disruptions caused by disasters. This is in line \nwith the targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030 and \nthe Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 9, on resilient infrastructure.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Strengthen disaster and climate risk analysis as an integral part of resilient \ninfrastructure development and maintenance policies, plans and programmes.  \n \n\u2022 Continue to provide financial and technical assistance to landlocked developing \ncountries for building and maintaining nationally and regionally integrated, \nquality, reliable, sustainable and resilient as well as climate- and disaster-\nresilient infrastructure in sectors such as transport, energy and information and \ncommunications technology.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n255. We commit to strengthening analysis on disaster risks, including the impacts of \nclimate change, as an integral part of sustainable and resilient infrastructure \ndevelopment, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, maintenance policies, \nplans and programmes. We also commit to implementing appropriate monitoring \nsystems to facilitate compliance of projects with guidelines and requirements.  \n256. We commit further to developing regionally integrated, sustainable, climate- and \ndisaster-resilient transport, energy and information and communications technology \ninfrastructure. We \nencourage \ndevelopment \npartners, \nincluding \nmultilateral \ndevelopment banks, to provide resources to landlocked developing countries for \nbuilding and maintaining climate- and disaster-resilient infrastructure, which is \nincreasingly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change.  \n \nV. \nLoss and damage  \n257. We are concerned that the adverse impacts of climate change that go beyond \nwhat can be mitigated or adapted to are significant for landlocked developing \ncountries, due to their vulnerabilities stemming from geographical, socioeconomic \nand development factors, and addressing them requires global solidarity and \ncooperation.  \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n35/48\n24-24446 \n \n258. We welcome the decision adopted at the fifth session of the Conference of the \nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change serving as \nthe Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement and the twenty-eighth session of the \nConference of the Parties to the Convention on the operationalization of the new \nfunding arrangements, including a fund, for responding to loss and damage for \nassisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects \nof climate change.  \nTarget:  \n \n\u2022 Promote consideration of the needs, priorities and vulnerabilities of the \nlandlocked developing countries in the new funding arrangements, including a \nfund, for responding to loss and damage.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n259. We acknowledge the urgent and immediate need for new, additional, predictable \nand adequate financial resources to assist developing countries that are particularly \nvulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to economic and \nnon\u2011economic loss and damage. We commit to the prompt implementation of the \nrelevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and the Conference of the Parties serving as the \nMeeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement with regard to the new funding \narrangements, including a fund, for responding to loss and damage, so that parties that \nare particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change may promptly \naccess the fund, taking into account the needs and concerns of landlocked developing \ncountries.  \n \nVI. Biodiversity loss  \n260. We note that many landlocked developing countries are both biodiversity-rich \nand also have significant natural resources. We recognize that the economies of the \nlandlocked developing countries are highly dependent on the flow of goods and \nservices that nature generates. Biodiversity and healthy ecosystems provide essential \nresources that directly support a range of economic activities, food security and \nnutrition and social services. It is a matter of concern that landlocked developing \ncountries experience important ecosystem and biodiversity losses. For instance, in \nlandlocked developing countries, land covered by forests has declined from 17.0 per \ncent in 2015 to 16.6 per cent in 2020, while the world average has remained constant.  \n261. We affirm that the landlocked developing countries\u2019 rich biodiversity and natural \nresource endowment should be conserved and harnessed only in a sustainable, fair \nand equitable manner to advance economic prosperity and human well-being, in \nfulfilment of the three objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity 15 and the \ngoals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. 16 \nStrategies for sustainable development can help landlocked developing countries to \ntransform and add value to primary products, while addressing their structural \nvulnerabilities and limited productive capacities.  \n262. We welcome the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on \nBiodiversity at its fifteenth meeting17 requesting the Global Environment Facility to \nestablish a special trust fund to support the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal \nGlobal Biodiversity Framework, to complement existing support and scale up \nfinancing to ensure its timely implementation, taking into account the need for \n_______________ \n \n15 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1760, No. 30619. \n \n16 United Nations Environment Programme, document CBD/COP/15/17, decision 15/4, annex. \n \n17 Ibid., decision 15/7. \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n36/48 \n \nadequacy, predictability and timely flow of funds. We also stress the importance of \nengaging all relevant stakeholders to support the implementation of the Framework.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Significantly enhance support to halt and reverse biodiversity loss in the \nlandlocked developing countries, including through the implementation of the \nKunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.  \n \n\u2022 Ensure the effective restoration by 2030 of degraded terrestrial and inland water \necosystems in landlocked developing countries, in order to enhance their \nbiodiversity and ecosystem functions, ecological integrity and connectivity.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n263. We reaffirm the commitment of the parties to the Convention on Biodiversity to \nthe implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework in an \nequitable manner in order to address the needs of landlocked developing countries \nand to halt and reverse biodiversity loss in those countries by 2030.  \n264. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries in revising or \nupdating national biodiversity strategies and action plans, including by promoting \ninvestments in alignment with the new Framework, mobilizing all sectors for \nincreased policy coherence and action, strengthening monitoring, and improving \nresource mobilization strategies.  \n265. We reaffirm the commitment of parties to the Convention on Biological \nDiversity to substantially and progressively increase the level of financial resources \nfrom all sources, including domestic, international, public and private resources, in \naccordance with article 20 of the Convention, capacity-building, as well as technical \nand scientific cooperation, and access to and transfer of technology in the context of \nthe implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework under \nthe Convention so that landlocked developing countries are able to fully implement \ntheir commitments.  \n \nPriority area 5: Means of implementation \n266. We acknowledge that available resources \u2013 domestic, external, public and \nprivate \u2013 have not been sufficient to meet the growing investment and spending needs \nof landlocked developing countries, despite the benefit of external resources, \nincluding international public finance, including official development assistance, \nforeign direct investment and other private flows, such as remittances and portfolio \ninvestment.  \n267. We therefore recognize that it is essential that landlocked developing countries, \ntransit countries and their partners take transformative action to realize the full \nimplementation of the Programme of Action, including through substantially \nincreasing resources from all sources.  \n \nI. \nDomestic resource mobilization  \n268. We recognize that domestic resource mobilization is a critical aspect of \neconomic development for all countries, including landlocked developing countries. \nA number of factors, such as narrow economic base, subsistence economies, \ninadequate tax administration and collection facilities, tax avoidance and evasion are \nconstraining the mobilization of domestic resources in landlocked developing \ncountries. An efficient and effective tax administration and strengthened institutional \ncapacity of the landlocked developing countries can contribute to increasing their \ndomestic resource mobilization.  \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n37/48\n24-24446 \n \n269. Gross domestic savings as a share of gross domestic product in landlocked \ndeveloping countries reached 24.1 per cent in 2021. However, this figure was much \nlower than the world average of 28 per cent, suggesting persistent development \nfinance deficits in landlocked developing countries.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Progressively increase tax revenue as a proportion of gross domestic product in \nall landlocked developing countries as appropriate.  \n \n\u2022 Enhance international cooperation for the recovery of stolen assets and their \nreturn to their countries of origin, in accordance with the United Nations \nConvention against Corruption18 and other applicable instruments.  \n \n\u2022 Enhance intergovernmental coordination to prevent and combat illicit financial \nflows.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n270. We call upon landlocked developing countries to diversify revenue sources \nbeyond traditional sectors, through promoting sectors such as manufacturing, services \nand technology to reduce dependency on a few commodities.  \n271. We commit to enhancing international tax cooperation and efforts to close \ninternational tax loopholes, all of which are aimed at avoiding base erosion and profit \nshifting. We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries in taking \nadvantage of international standards in tax transparency and the exchange of \ninformation, such as by implementing the new international standards of automatic \nexchange of information.  \n272. We call upon landlocked developing countries to manage extracted resources \nsustainably through sovereign transparent and accountable governance frameworks \nand ensuring that extractive industries contribute a fair share to public revenue, as \nwell as reviewing existing tax and financial incentives with a view to maximizing \npublic revenue from extractive industries.  \n273. We call upon landlocked developing countries to foster domestic financial \ndeepening to augment domestic resources and attract savings from the diaspora, \nincluding through diaspora bonds, foreign currency-denominated deposits and \nsyndicated loans using remittances as collateral where appropriate.  \n274. We call for innovative financial instruments that harness the potential of digital \ntechnologies for financing for national sustainable development priorities and the \nSustainable Development Goals at the national level, including digital finance \nplatforms, innovative digital services, digitalization of micro-, small and medium-\nsized enterprises and public resources mobilization.  \n275. We call for the mobilization of financing mechanisms, in particular existing \nones, to provide catalytic financing for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, \nincluding those owned by women, in landlocked developing countries to mobilize \nsustainable private investment flows that promote the Sustainable Development \nGoals, build resilience to current and possible future crises and shocks, and help to \nmitigate their impacts.  \n276. We recommit to preventing and combating illicit financial flows and \nstrengthening international cooperation and good practices on assets return and \nrecovery to help landlocked developing countries to mobilize resources. We reaffirm \nour commitment to strive to eliminate safe havens that create incentives for the \n_______________ \n \n18 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2349, No. 42146. \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n38/48 \n \ntransfer abroad of stolen assets and illicit financial flows. We will implement our \nobligations to prevent and combat corruption, bribery and money-laundering in all \ntheir forms enshrined in the existing international architecture, in particular in those \nprescribed in the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the United \nNations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. 19 \n \nII. \nOfficial development assistance and other sources of external finance  \n277. We recognize that the provision of official development assistance remains a \ncritical complement to domestic resources in landlocked developing countries and \nacknowledge that those countries depend on official development assistance to \npromote their economic development.  \n278. We note that official development assistance flows continue to be concentrated \nin a few landlocked developing countries and many landlocked developing countries \nreceive less official development assistance compared to other developing countries.  \n279. We recognize that the volume of development finance in support of landlocked \ndeveloping countries through traditional and innovative sources needs to be \nsubstantially increased, including through concessional finance and the mobilization \nof the private sector for, inter alia, developing quality, reliable, sustainable and \nresilient infrastructure projects. \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Substantially increase the volume of development finance in support of \nlandlocked developing countries through traditional and innovative sources of \nfinance.  \n \n\u2022 Enhance the capacity of landlocked developing countries to develop bankable \nprojects and secure financing to effectively address their needs and challenges \nin a manner that has the greatest social, economic and environmental benefits.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n280. We urge development partners, including the developed countries, to honour \ntheir respective official development assistance commitments fully and in time and to \nstep up efforts to increase their official development assistance to landlocked \ndeveloping countries, recognizing the specific needs and challenges of landlocked \ndeveloping countries, in order to effectively implement the present Programme of \nAction, recognizing that grant finance and highly concessional finance are of great \nimportance to them.  \n281. We urge international action to address the adverse effects of the increasingly \nfinancialized commodity markets, including through the establishment of rules to \nlimit speculation, and new countercyclical financing facilities that can mitigate price \nshocks.  \n282. We commit to scaling up innovative finance to landlocked developing countries, \nto complement and better leverage already established financing mechanisms through \ninnovative tools such as blended finance, and to enhance transparency and \naccountability in the use of official development assistance for landlocked developing \ncountries, to ensure that funds are effectively and efficiently utilized for sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n283. We acknowledge the need to accelerate the transfer of environmentally sound \ntechnologies on mutually agreed terms to developing countries, including landlocked \ndeveloping countries. We urge countries to consider ways to provide landlocked \n_______________ \n \n19 Ibid., vol. 2225, No. 39574. \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n39/48\n24-24446 \n \ndeveloping countries with greater access to global climate funds, and we will explore \nthe mobilization of additional resources through the issuance of green bonds and other \ninstruments.  \n284. We will continue efforts to improve the quality, impact and effectiveness of \ndevelopment cooperation and other international efforts in public finance, including \nby aligning the support with the national priorities of landlocked developing \ncountries, reducing fragmentation and accelerating the untying of aid.  \n285. We urge multilateral development banks to bring forward actions to mobilize \nand provide additional financing within their mandates, to support landlocked \ndeveloping countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and deliver the \nscale of finance needed for infrastructure investments, to improve landlocked \ndeveloping countries\u2019 connectivity.  \n286. We acknowledge the role of multilateral development banks in catalysing \nprivate investment and encourage the provision of increased concessional finance for \ninfrastructure development to landlocked developing countries. We encourage \nmultilateral development banks to enhance access to digital trade finance to help to \nnarrow the trade finance gap, recognizing their important role in providing trade \nfinance.  \n287. We welcome the special drawing rights allocation of the equivalent of \n650 billion United States dollars of 23 August 2021, and commend the achievement \nof the target of 100 billion dollars in pledges for rechannelling special drawing rights \nor equivalent contributions, recommend the exploration of further voluntary options \nrelated to special drawing rights that could serve the needs of developing member \ncountries of the International Monetary Fund, call for the urgent voluntary \nrechannelling of special drawing rights for countries most in need, including \nlandlocked developing countries, including through multilateral development banks, \nand the International Monetary Fund Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust and the \nResilience and Sustainability Trust, while respecting relevant legal frameworks and \npreserving the reserve asset character of special drawing rights, and will explore ways \nfor future allocations of special drawing rights to benefit those countries most in need, \nincluding landlocked developing countries.  \n288. We resolve to strengthen technical, financial and capacity-building support to \nenable landlocked developing countries to advance their sustainable development \nefforts and access innovative financing mechanisms, including to formulate and \nimplement bankable infrastructure development projects. \n \nIII. Foreign direct investment  \n289. We recognize that foreign direct investment can help landlocked developing \ncountries to address their challenges by providing access to capital, technology and \nmarkets, and note the importance of both attracting foreign direct investment and \nensuring that it aligns with their national development priorities.  \n290. We are concerned that, while inflows of foreign direct investment towards \nlandlocked developing countries had recovered from the COVID\u201119 pandemic in \n2021, this recovery was below both the global and the developing country average. \nWe note that factors leading to the decline in foreign direct investment flows to \nlandlocked developing countries have included their weak integration into global and \nregional trade networks, higher competition for investment flows, low productive \ncapacities and uncompetitive investment regulations.  \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n40/48 \n \n291. We recognize that increased foreign direct investment in landlocked developing \ncountries is needed, especially in infrastructure development to boost economic \ndiversification and create decent employment.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 Substantially increase foreign direct investment flows to the landlocked \ndeveloping countries.  \n \n\u2022 Mobilize all existing investment promotion platforms to support the attraction \nof investments to landlocked developing countries, including through peer \nlearning and capacity-building among investment promotion agencies, \ninvestment policy reviews, and engagement with Tax Inspectors without \nBorders to ensure fair and transparent revenue collection.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n292. We aim to increase foreign direct investment to landlocked developing \ncountries, especially towards developing essential infrastructure, including \ntransportation networks, such as roads, railways and ports in landlocked developing \ncountries, as well as multimodal systems.  \n293. We commit to promoting foreign direct investment towards sectors that have \nexport potential and can diversify landlocked developing countries\u2019 economies, raise \ntheir foreign exchange earnings, increase economic growth and promote the growth \nof medium and high technology value sectors and their integration into global value \nchains.  \n294. We call upon landlocked developing countries to establish clear and stable \ninvestment policies and a conducive business environment to attract foreign direct \ninvestment, including by addressing issues related to property rights, contract \nenforcement and dispute resolution.  \n295. We urge the international community to take measures to ensure that foreign \ndirect investment is directed toward sectors and projects that align with the \nSustainable Development Goals and have positive spillover effects on the economy.  \n296. We commit to developing mechanisms to facilitate investment guarantees to \npromote foreign direct investment to landlocked developing countries.  \n297. We commit to the mobilization of all existing investment promotion platforms \nto attract additional investment for landlocked developing countries, including \nthrough peer learning and capacity-building among investment promotion agencies. \nWe further commit to strengthening the capacity of Governments of landlocked \ndeveloping countries to facilitate investment, including for the promotion of foreign \ndirect investment, domestic investment promotion, investment facilitation, tourism \npromotion, export promotion, and micro-, small and medium-sized enterprise \ndevelopment, and to enable them to attract foreign direct investment.  \n \nIV. Remittances  \n298. We recognize that remittances are crucial for landlocked developing countries\u2019 \neconomic growth and social development as a private flow that complements other \nsources of income and note that remittances also have the potential to spur \nentrepreneurship.  \n299. We underline the crucial role of remittances, to fight poverty and inequalities \nand achieve gender equality, considering their countercyclical role in times of crisis.  \n300. We recognize the crucial role of implementing innovative ways to take \nadvantage of technological breakthroughs, including digital solutions, that improve \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n41/48\n24-24446 \n \naccess to and the use and quality of financial services to promote faster, safer and \ncheaper remittances.  \n301. We note that remittances can help to start or grow small firms, boosting the small \nand medium-sized enterprise sector, and recognize that this entrepreneurial effort \nboosts grass-roots economic development, job creation and revenue.  \n302. We recognize that remittance flows to landlocked developing countries \nincreased by 43 per cent between 2014 and 2022 but note that the distribution of \nremittances across those countries is uneven.  \nTargets:  \n \n\u2022 By 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrants\u2019 \nremittances.  \n \n\u2022 Eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent.  \n \n\u2022 Ensure that financial services related to remittances are equally accessible for \nboth women and men.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n303. We commit to working to improve access to and the use and quality of financial \nservices to lower the cost of remittances to landlocked developing countries and \nwelcome international action, such as the Global Forum on Remittances, Investment \nand Development led by the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and \nthe Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion, with the objective of improving the \nflow and reducing the cost of remittances.  \n304. We encourage landlocked developing countries to foster the investment of \nremittances in education and healthcare, leading to human capital development and \nbetter employment prospects for recipients.  \n305. We call upon the relevant stakeholders to address the issue of high transaction \nfee costs on remittances due to geographical factors and limited access to financial \nservices.  \n306. We commit to expanding financial inclusion and improving access to banking \nservices, particularly for women, to help to lower remittance costs and encourage \nmore people to use formal channels for sending and receiving remittances.  \n307. We invite the International Think Tank for Landlocked Developing Countries to \nassist in improving the collection and analysis of data on remittances to understand \ntheir economic impact and to formulate appropriate policies and strategies.  \n308. We commit to creating incentive programmes to encourage the use of \nremittances for long-term investments, such as providing microloans or supporting \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, including those run and owned by women \nentrepreneurs.  \n309. We encourage landlocked developing countries to establish clear and supportive \npolicies and regulations to facilitate remittances, promote financial inclusion and \nensure the security of remittance transactions.  \n \nV. \nDebt relief and concessional financing  \n310. We recognize that external borrowing is an important source of financing for \nlandlocked developing countries and note with concern that high and rising interest \nrates pose significant debt sustainability risks to several landlocked developing \ncountries with large external debt burdens.  \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n42/48 \n \n311. We recommend assisting landlocked developing countries in attaining long-term \ndebt sustainability through coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, \ndebt relief, debt restructuring and sound debt management, as appropriate, to enhance \nthe ability of countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. \n312. We note with concern that, of the 22 landlocked developing countries for which \na debt distress analysis is available, 7 have a high risk of distress and 4 are already in \ndistress.  \n313. We recognize the importance of a holistic approach that combines, as \nappropriate, debt relief, sound debt management, concessional financing, good \ngovernance and strategic investments to improve debt sustainability and drive \nsustainable development in landlocked developing countries.  \nTarget:  \n \n\u2022 Address the debt problems of landlocked developing countries that are in debt \ndistress or in high risk of it and keep the external debt of all landlocked \ndeveloping countries within a sustainable level.  \nWe commit to taking the following actions:  \n314. We recognize the important role, on a case-by-case basis, of debt relief, \nincluding debt cancellation, as appropriate, and debt restructuring as debt crisis \nprevention, management and resolution tools, while also recognizing the development \nneeds of landlocked developing countries.  \n315. We support landlocked developing countries in seeking to negotiate, as a last \nresort, on a case-by-case basis and through existing frameworks, agreements on \ntemporary debt standstills between debtors and creditors in order to help to mitigate \nthe adverse impacts of a debt crisis and stabilize macroeconomic developments.  \n316. We invite creditors and debtors to further explore, where appropriate and on a \nmutually agreed, transparent and case-by-case basis, the use of new and improved \ndebt instruments such as debt swaps, including debt for equity in Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal projects, as well as debt indexation instruments in the landlocked \ndeveloping countries.  \n317. We urge international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Bank \nGroup, the International Monetary Fund and regional development banks to increase \nsupport, including financial and technical assistance, for institutional capacity-\nbuilding in landlocked developing countries to enhance sustainable upstream and \ndownstream debt management as an integral part of national development strategies, \nincluding by promoting comprehensive, transparent and accountable debt \nmanagement systems and negotiation and renegotiation capacities and by supporting \nlegal advice in relation to addressing external debt litigation and debt data \nreconciliation between creditors and debtors, notably through the Common \nFramework for Debt Treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative, so \nthat debt sustainability may be achieved and maintained.  \n \nImplementation, follow-up and monitoring \n318. We emphasize that efficient follow-up and monitoring mechanisms adapted at \nthe national, subregional, regional and global levels are crucial for the successful \nimplementation of the present Programme of Action and their full alignment with \nexisting frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals. We reaffirm that \nnational, regional and global mechanisms should be mutually complementary and \nreinforcing.  \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n43/48\n24-24446 \n \n319. We underscore that national leadership and ownership of development strategies \nand policies of landlocked developing countries, transit countries and development \npartners must be ensured during the whole process of implementation, follow-up and \nmonitoring.  \n320. We stress that implementation, follow-up and review undertaken at the national, \nsubregional, regional and global levels should be a continuous process, coupled with \nclose coordination and cooperation with transit countries and development partners \nas well as all other relevant stakeholders, and the process should be aimed at \ndelivering on their commitments, reinforcing partnerships and mutual accountability \nat all levels and by all actors.  \n \nI. \nNational reviews  \n321. We encourage regular and inclusive reviews of progress on the Programme of \nAction at the national level that are country-led and country-driven with the full \ninvolvement of all relevant stakeholders. National parliaments as well as other \ninstitutions can also support these processes.  \n322. At the national level, each landlocked developing country Government should \ndevelop an ambitious national implementation strategy and integrate the provisions \nof the Programme of Action into its national development policies and United Nations \nSustainable Development Cooperation Framework.  \n323. We emphasize that existing country-level review and reporting mechanisms, \nincluding those for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, nationally \ndetermined contributions and United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation \nFrameworks, should be broadened to cover the review of the Programme of Action \nand extended to all landlocked developing countries.  \n \nII. \nRegional reviews  \n324. Follow-up and review at the regional and subregional levels is particularly \nimportant as cooperation for transit transport is inherently implemented at the \nbilateral, subregional and regional levels. We urge in this respect the cooperation of \nregional and subregional commissions and organizations.  \n325. We call for inclusive regional processes to draw on national-level reviews and \ncontribute to follow-up and review at the global level, including at the high-level \npolitical forum on sustainable development.  \n326. We stress the need for fully functioning and effective regional coordination \nmechanisms within the framework of the regional commissions to support successful \nimplementation of the Programme of Action.  \n327. We encourage the regional commissions to undertake biennial regional reviews \non the implementation of the new Programme of Action, in close coordination and \ncooperation with subregional and regional development banks and intergovernmental \norganizations, and to submit analytical reports on the implementation of the \nProgramme of Action. The relevant regional and subregional organizations and the \nprivate sector should be actively involved in the sessions of the regional commissions \nin that regard.  \n328. We note that inclusive regional processes will draw on national reviews and \ncontribute to follow-up and review at the global level. The relevant United Nations \nregional commissions and agencies should continue to ensure that the needs and \nchallenges of landlocked developing countries are addressed as part of their ongoing \nwork.  \n \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n44/48 \n \nIII. Global-level implementation  \n329. We recognize that the implementation and monitoring mechanisms established \nat the global level should be strengthened and improved with a view to ensuring \ntimely and effective follow-up of the implementation of the Programme of Action, \nincluding through better stocktaking of policies and measures at the national, regional \nand sectoral levels; improved substantive support for the implementation of the \nProgramme of Action at the global level; systematic monitoring of relevant \ndevelopments in other intergovernmental processes and action by the United Nations \nsystem organizations and inter-agency processes; and structured support for follow\u2011up \nfrom the landlocked developing countries themselves. \n330. We call for strengthening the science-policy interface to provide a strong \nevidence-based instrument to support the implementation of the present Programme \nof Action in all its priority areas.  \n331. We invite the General Assembly to continue to monitor the implementation of \nthe Programme of Action on an annual basis under the specific item on its agenda. \nFollow-up and review at the global level will be informed by an annual progress report \nto be prepared by the Secretary-General in cooperation with the United Nations \nsystem on the basis of the data produced by national statistical systems and \ninformation collected at the regional level and from the Statistics Division of the \nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs of the Secretariat.  \n332. Effective linkages will be made with the follow-up and review arrangements of \nall relevant United Nations conferences, processes and frameworks, including the \n2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai \nFramework.  \n \nIV. Mainstreaming the Programme of Action  \n333. We call upon landlocked developing countries, transit countries, development \npartners and United Nations system entities to mainstream the Programme of Action \ninto their respective national and sectoral development strategies, development \ncooperation frameworks and strategic plans for its effective implementation where \nappropriate. Landlocked developing countries and transit developing countries are \nencouraged to establish national coordination mechanisms, where appropriate.  \n334. We invite regional and subregional organizations, including regional economic \ncommunities and regional development banks, to mainstream the implementation of \nthe Programme of Action into their relevant programmes.  \n335. We invite the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, as well \nas the high-level political forum on sustainable development, to devote adequate time \nto discussion of the sustainable development challenges facing the landlocked \ndeveloping countries in order to enhance engagement and implement commitments.  \n336. We invite the governing bodies of the United Nations funds and programmes \nand other multilateral organizations, including the World Bank Group, the \nInternational Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions, as well as \nthe World Trade Organization, to contribute to the implementation of the Programme \nof Action and to integrate it into their work programmes, as appropriate and in \naccordance with their relevant mandates. These organizations are invited to \nparticipate fully in reviews of the Programme of Action at the national, subregional, \nregional and global levels.  \n \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n45/48\n24-24446 \n \nV. \nFull mobilization of the United Nations system  \n337. The Secretary-General is requested to ensure the full mobilization of all relevant \nparts of the United Nations system to facilitate coordinated implementation and \ncoherence in the follow-up to and monitoring of the Programme of Action at the \nnational, subregional, regional and global levels.  \n338. The available coordination mechanisms, such as the United Nations System \nChief Executives Board for Coordination and the United Nations Sustainable \nDevelopment Group, should be broadly utilized and we call for the existing high-level \nUnited Nations coordination mechanisms to generate momentum and support for the \nProgramme of Action in the system.  \n339. We acknowledge with appreciation the work of the Inter-Agency Consultative \nGroup for Landlocked Developing Countries, led by the Office of the High \nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries \nand Small Island Developing States, and call for its further strengthening.  \n340. We call for closer coordination between the Office of the High Representative \nand United Nations country teams in landlocked developing countries, as an important \ntool for follow-up to and review of the implementation of provisions of the \nProgramme of Action. We also stress the critical importance of the more proactive \nrole of United Nations agencies, including through the United Nations resident \ncoordinators and country teams, in mobilizing all stakeholders to help Governments \nof landlocked developing countries to address the challenges caused by those \ncountries\u2019 structural constraints.  \n \nVI. Role of the Board of Advisers to the President of the General Assembly on \nLeast Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small \nIsland Developing States and the Group of Friends of Landlocked \nDeveloping Countries \n341. We recall the Board of Advisers to the President of the General Assembly on \nLeast Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \nDeveloping States and call for leveraging the mechanism to share experiences and \nmobilize resources for landlocked developing countries.  \n342. We underscore the important role of the Group of Friends of Landlocked \nDeveloping Countries and call for its active participation and support in the \nimplementation of the Programme of Action.  \n \nVII. Preparation of a comprehensive road map and implementation and \nmonitoring framework  \n343. We invite the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed \nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States to \nprepare a comprehensive road map for the accelerated implementation of the \nProgramme of Action, identifying specific roles and responsibilities of various \nstakeholders, with a view to ensuring that the commitments in favour of landlocked \ndeveloping countries lead to concrete deliverables that would facilitate \nimplementation of the Programme of Action and help landlocked developing \ncountries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.  \n \nVIII. Network of national focal points  \n344. We note the network of national focal points of landlocked developing countries \nestablished by the Office of the High Representative and the convening of meetings \nof the national focal points on a regular basis. We also note that the national focal \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n46/48 \n \npoints designated by landlocked developing countries are heavily involved in the \nlocalization of the Vienna Programme of Action and the Sustainable Development \nGoals, as well as their national implementation, monitoring, review and reporting of \nthe Programme of Action. We invite the Office of the High Representative to further \nstrengthen the network of national focal points of landlocked developing countries \nand convene annual meetings of the focal points to share experiences and best \npractices on mainstreaming the new Programme of Action and the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals into national development processes, as well as their \nimplementation and follow-up; network among peers; and better understand existing \nmeans of implementation, including viable financing and business models.  \n345. We commit to ensuring synergy and coherence between the implementation of \nthe Programme of Action and the 2030 Agenda and other ongoing and upcoming \nprocesses.  \n \nIX. Strengthening national statistical capacity  \n346. We recognize that high-quality, timely, relevant, disaggregated and reliable data \nwill be needed to help with the measurement of progress and to ensure that no one is \nleft behind. Such data are key to decision-making.  \n347. We note that national statistical institutions in landlocked developing countries \nremain underresourced, both financially and technically. The resulting scarcity of data \nand weak frameworks for monitoring and evaluation constrain the capacity for \neffective implementation and monitoring. The absence of robust reliable data also \nconstrains the advocacy work to address the special circumstances of landlocked \ndeveloping countries.  \n348. We commit to enhancing capacity-building support to developing countries, \nincluding for landlocked developing countries, to increase significantly the \navailability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, sex, \nage, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographical location and other \ncharacteristics relevant in national contexts.  \n \nX. \nUndertaking thematic review and analytical work  \n349. The Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, \nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States is requested to \nundertake thematic reviews of the progress on the Programme of Action, including \ncross-cutting issues, as and when appropriate.  \n350. The Office of the High Representative will continue to be responsible for \ncoordinated substantive support to the global review of the Programme of Action, \nincluding through the following:  \n \n(a) \nFollowing up on action taken at the national level on the basis of input \nfrom Governments, United Nations system agencies, civil society organizations and \nother relevant stakeholders;  \n \n(b) \nMonitoring sectoral policy developments at the intergovernmental \nprocesses of relevant international and regional organizations;  \n \n(c) \nMaintaining substantive contact with United Nations system organizations \nand other relevant international and regional organizations, as well as resident \ncoordinators in landlocked developing countries;  \n \n(d) \nAssisting the Secretary-General in his efforts in support of landlocked \ndeveloping countries;  \n\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034 \nA/RES/79/233\n \n47/48\n24-24446 \n \n \n(e) \nSupporting follow-up by landlocked developing countries at the global and \nsectoral levels;  \n \n(f) \nMaintaining close collaboration and coordination with the regional \ncoordinators system to ensure their full involvement in the implementation, \nmainstreaming follow-up and monitoring of the Programme of Action.  \n351. The Office of the High Representative will continue to monitor international \npolicy developments of relevance to landlocked developing countries, including the \noutcomes of major global conferences, and carry out relevant advocacy efforts aimed \nat the effective and timely implementation of the Programme of Action.  \n352. The governing bodies of organizations in the United Nations system should \nconduct sectoral and thematic reviews of the Programme of Action, where \nappropriate, within their respective mandates.  \n353. We call for strengthening the International Think Tank for Landlocked \nDeveloping Countries and for sharing experiences and know-how, and undertaking \nresearch and analytical works in the thematic priority areas of the Programme of \nAction.  \n \nXI. Role of the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed \nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \nDeveloping States  \n354. The Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, \nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States should \nstrengthen its functions to undertake the following:  \n \n(a) \nAssist the Secretary-General in the systematic and effective follow-up to \nand monitoring of the implementation of the Programme of Action and the full \nmobilization and coordination of all parts of the United Nations system, including \nthrough the use of data, with a view to facilitating the coordinated implementation of \nand coherence in the follow-up to and monitoring of the Programme of Action at the \ncountry, regional and global levels aligned with the 2030 Agenda;  \n \n(b) \nAssist in mobilizing international support and resources for the \nimplementation of the Programme of Action;  \n \n(c) \nStrengthen its awareness-raising and advocacy work in favour of \nlandlocked developing countries, in partnership with the relevant entities of the \nUnited Nations system, as well as other relevant stakeholders, including parliaments, \ncivil society, the media and academia; \n \n(d) \nUndertake research and analytical works to provide substantive support to \nlandlocked developing countries in group consultations and in their participation in \nother intergovernmental meetings and conferences, in order to facilitate science- and \nevidence-based decisions in favour of landlocked developing countries, taking into \naccount new and emerging challenges and opportunities; to support the work of the \nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, the high-level political forum \non sustainable development and the United Nations System Chief Executives Board \nfor Coordination as it relates to landlocked developing countries; and to foster debate \nand innovative thinking, promote consensus on ways forward and coordinate efforts \nto achieve the implementation of the Programme of Action. \n355. With a view to ensuring the effective implementation of the functions of the \nOffice of the High Representative and strengthening its capabilities and effectiveness \nto support landlocked developing countries, as well as the effectiveness of the United \nNations system support provided to landlocked developing countries, we request the \n\nA/RES/79/233 \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the \nDecade 2024\u20132034\n \n24-24446\n48/48 \n \nSecretary-General to prepare a report, in consultation with Member States and the \nrelevant specialized agencies, funds, programmes and regional commissions, taking \ninto account the work done by the United Nations system, and to submit it with \nrecommendations to the General Assembly for its consideration at its eightieth \nsession.  \n \nXII. Midterm review and the Fourth United Nations Conference on \nLandlocked Developing Countries \n356. The General Assembly is invited to consider conducting a comprehensive high-\nlevel midterm review of the implementation of the Programme of Action in 2029. The \nAssembly, towards the end of the decade, is also invited to consider holding, in 2034, \na Fourth United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries in order to \nmake a comprehensive appraisal of the implementation of the Programme of Action \nand to decide on subsequent action. \n \n",

    "2": "The years of cascading challenges, in which a health and socioeconomic crisis has shaken everyone, individually and collectively, threaten the attainment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 1 and all the Sustainable Development Goals. The world is plagued by growing poverty, hunger and malnutrition, inequalities, human rights violations, digital divides within countries and between developed and developing countries, vaccine inequity, complex humanitarian emergencies and armed conflict, insecurity, pandemics, environmental degradation, climate change and disasters. The situation for landlocked developing countries is particularly bleak. The situation demands urgent mobilization of our collective resources, decisive actions by all and innovative solutions to the unprecedented challenges. In this context, we strongly reaffirm our unwavering commitment to work tirelessly for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals in a balanced and integrated manner in its three dimensions, including by taking tangible steps and calling for greater action and extraordinary measures by all countries; and strengthened international and multilateral cooperation to support the landlocked developing countries in this endeavour and to reach the furthest behind first.",

It is grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,2 international human rights treaties, the United Nations Millennium Declaration3 and the 2005 World Summit Outcome.4 It is informed by other instruments such as the Declaration on the Right to Development. 5 We recognize the need to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies that provide equal access to justice and that are based on respect for human rights, on effective rule of law and good governance at all levels and on transparent, effective and accountable institutions.",
    "4": "We further reaffirm our commitment to enhancing our efforts for the full and timely implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development,6 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 7 and the Paris Agreement 8 and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030,9 particularly with regard to the special development needs and challenges of landlocked developing countries.",
    "5": "We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 10 including, inter alia, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, as set out in principle 7 thereof.",
    "6": "We note that mixed progress was made in the implementation of the six priority areas of the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014\u20132024. 11 The combined effects of the COVID\u201119 pandemic, geopolitical tensions and conflict, and climate change, affected progress. We note with concern that the severe financing deficit, in particular for infrastructure, limited data and technical capacity constraints also undermined progress. Additionally, adverse global economic conditions characterized by tepid growth, surging inflation, increased pressure on energy, food and finance, supply chain disruptions and elevated trade costs continue to affect the recovery efforts of landlocked developing countries. Furthermore, landlocked developing countries were significantly affected by disasters, many of which are exacerbated by climate change, biodiversity loss and disasters, such as desertification, recurrent droughts, melting glaciers, floods and glacier lake outburst floods.",
    "7": "We recognize the limited progress that has been made during the implementation period of the Vienna Programme of Action. Considerable efforts have contributed to the realization of meaningful outcomes, including in facilitating trade, fostering regional integration, accession of landlocked developing and transit countries to international conventions for the promotion of transit and trade, and completing missing links and improving the quality of infrastructure for increased connectivity.",
    "8": "However, we note with concern that progress fell short of the goals and targets set out in the Vienna Programme of Action. Economic growth across the landlocked developing countries was modest and insufficient to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality, particularly among women, children and people in vulnerable situations, as well as people working in informal sectors.",
    "9": "We are concerned that landlocked developing countries have made very limited progress towards achieving structural transformation. We also note with concern that the economic structure of the landlocked developing countries continues to be characterized by a low level of diversification, with exports concentrated in a limited number of products, which tend to have low value addition and to be greatly susceptible to current and possible future external shocks and hazards. Road, rail, water and air transport infrastructure, and connecting river ports and seaports, remain insufficiently funded and underdeveloped, with huge missing links and inadequate maintenance.",
    "10": "We note with concern that the share of global merchandise exports of landlocked developing countries remains marginal, at only 1.1 per cent of the total global share in 2022. There was a growing interest in regional integration and cooperation among landlocked developing countries. The number of regional trade agreements that each landlocked developing country is a party to has increased, on average, from 3.3 in 2014 to 4.3 in 2023.",
    "11": "We express our concern that, while there was some progress in the allocation of official development assistance and aid for trade to landlocked developing countries, foreign direct investment flows declined and have largely been concentrated in natural resources. Furthermore, a large number of landlocked developing countries are either in debt distress or at a high risk of it.",
    "12": "We note that technology is rapidly changing the global economic landscape. It is reshaping work processes, production and distribution methods and consumption patterns. It is driving new innovations and fostering growth opportunities. It can also bridge the existing digital divides, including the growing gender digital divide, and accelerate progress for inclusive and sustainable development. Despite extraordinary opportunities, landlocked developing countries are not able to fully harness its potentials. This is due to a number of constraints, including infrastructure gaps, the relatively high cost of information and communications technology services, low digital literacy rates, insufficient regulatory frameworks and the high cost of accessing submarine cables.",
    "13": "We recognize that, during the implementation period, there was significant development of regional, subregional and multilateral initiatives to support transit. Progress was also made in ratifying the relevant legal agreements. Tools were developed to improve transit, such as the World Customs Organization transit guidelines, electronic consignment note and electronic TIR. Some progress was made in some corridors on the specific objective of the Vienna Programme of Action of reducing travel time along corridors.",
    "14": "We also note that some progress was made in completing missing links and generally improving the quality of infrastructure for increased connectivity of landlocked developing countries, but challenges remain. Several highway networks and railway lines were commissioned in those countries during the implementation period, but many more are needed.",
    "15": "We recognize the challenges that hampered the full implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action, including the persisting insufficiency and inadequacy of means of implementation, a lack of capacity in formulating financially viable infrastructure projects, low flows of official development assistance, the concentration of investment inflows towards natural resources, high debt vulnerabilities and multiple international crises, including the COVID\u201119 pandemic, that have had a disproportionately severe impact on the landlocked developing countries.",
    "16": "We reaffirm the importance of promoting unfettered, efficient and cost-effective access to and from the sea by all means of transport, on the basis of the freedom of transit, and other related measures, in accordance with applicable rules of international law. We reaffirm the need to reduce trade transaction costs and transport costs, and to develop adequate transit transport infrastructure networks. We recognize the continued importance of structural transformation, value addition, industrialization and diversification.",
    "17": "We recognize that increased participation in international trade, anchored in a strengthened multilateral trading system that is equitable and fair, is critical to the economic growth of landlocked developing countries and the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals. We recognize the crucial role of transport corridors as the backbone of transportation networks, linking major gateways and hubs, to enhance landlocked developing countries\u2019 connectivity to markets, achieve efficient transit and reduce transport costs.",
    "18": "We also recognize the importance of investment in supporting human capital development through inclusive, equitable, quality education and skills training for all, including for those in vulnerable situations. We acknowledge the importance of quality science, technology, engineering and mathematics education and institutional capacity development in landlocked developing countries in order to accelerate poverty reduction and effective sustainable development measures.",
    "19": " domestic resource mobilization and substantially reducing illicit financial flows, and strengthening the enabling environment for investments.",
    "20": "We express concern that the gender gap persists across all areas, including with respect to assets, inputs and services. We reaffirm that gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls will make a crucial contribution to progress across all the Sustainable Development Goals and targets in landlocked developing countries. We underline the urgent need to invest in and strengthen efforts to support the empowerment of all women and girls, including by removing all legal, social and economic barriers to achieving gender equality.",
    "21": "We further recognize that strong bilateral, multilateral and multi-stakeholder partnerships are critical and commit to working in collaboration with academia, civil society and the private sector to drive innovation that will identify solutions to pressing development challenges and the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Programme of Action, including through transparent, effective and accountable public-private partnerships.",
    "22": "We recognize that landlocked developing countries, due to their structural constraints, in addition to their landlockedness, require additional efforts, including additional borrowing, to stimulate their development, which affects their fiscal space and in turn impacts the policy space they require to support their sustainable development. This situation creates a bottleneck in financing for development and demands responses and solutions tailored to the specificities of these countries.",

VI. Biodiversity loss",
    "260": "We note that many landlocked developing countries are both biodiversity-rich and also have significant natural resources. We recognize that the economies of the landlocked developing countries are highly dependent on the flow of goods and services that nature generates. Biodiversity and healthy ecosystems provide essential resources that directly support a range of economic activities, food security and nutrition and social services. It is a matter of concern that landlocked developing countries experience important ecosystem and biodiversity losses. For instance, in landlocked developing countries, land covered by forests has declined from 17.0 per cent in 2015 to 16.6 per cent in 2020, while the world average has remained constant.",
    "261": "We affirm that the landlocked developing countries\u2019 rich biodiversity and natural resource endowment should be conserved and harnessed only in a sustainable, fair and equitable manner to advance economic prosperity and human well-being, in fulfilment of the three objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity 15 and the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. 16 Strategies for sustainable development can help landlocked developing countries to transform and add value to primary products, while addressing their structural vulnerabilities and limited productive capacities.",

    "264": "We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries in revising or updating national biodiversity strategies and action plans, including by promoting investments in alignment with the new Framework, mobilizing all sectors for increased policy coherence and action, strengthening monitoring, and improving resource mobilization strategies.",
    "265": "We reaffirm the commitment of parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity to substantially and progressively increase the level of financial resources from all sources, including domestic, international, public and private resources, in accordance with article 20 of the Convention, capacity-building, as well as technical and scientific cooperation, and access to and transfer of technology in the context of the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework under the Convention so that landlocked developing countries are able to fully implement their commitments. Priority area 5: Means of implementation",
    "266": "We acknowledge that available resources \u2013 domestic, external, public and private \u2013 have not been sufficient to meet the growing investment and spending needs of landlocked developing countries, despite the benefit of external resources, including international public finance, including official development assistance, foreign direct investment and other private flows, such as remittances and portfolio investment.",

I. Domestic resource mobilization",
    "268": "",
    "269": "Gross domestic savings as a share of gross domestic product in landlocked developing countries reached 24.1 per cent in 2021. However, this figure was much lower than the world average of 28 per cent, suggesting persistent development finance deficits in landlocked developing countries. Targets: \u2022 Progressively increase tax revenue as a proportion of gross domestic product in all landlocked developing countries as appropriate. \u2022 Enhance international cooperation for the recovery of stolen assets and their return to their countries of origin, in accordance with the United Nations Convention against Corruption18 and other applicable instruments. \u2022 Enhance intergovernmental coordination to prevent and combat illicit financial flows. We commit to taking the following actions:",
    "270": "We call upon landlocked developing countries to diversify revenue sources beyond traditional sectors, through promoting sectors such as manufacturing, services and technology to reduce dependency on a few commodities.",

    "283": "We acknowledge the need to accelerate the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on mutually agreed terms to developing countries, including landlocked developing countries. We urge countries to consider ways to provide landlocked developing countries with greater access to global climate funds, and we will explore the mobilization of additional resources through the issuance of green bonds and other instruments.",
    "284": "We will continue efforts to improve the quality, impact and effectiveness of development cooperation and other international efforts in public finance, including by aligning the support with the national priorities of landlocked developing countries, reducing fragmentation and accelerating the untying of aid.",
