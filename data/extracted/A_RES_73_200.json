Model Law on Recognition and Enforcement of Insolvency-Related \nJudgments of the United Nations Commission on International \nTrade Law  \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecalling its resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, by which it \nestablished the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with a \nmandate to further the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of \ninternational trade and in that respect to bear in mind the interests of all peoples, in \nparticular those of developing countries, in the extensive development of international \ntrade, \n \nRecognizing that effective insolvency regimes are increasingly seen as a means \nof encouraging economic development and investment, as well as fostering \nentrepreneurial activity and preserving employment, \n \nConvinced that the law of recognition and enforcement of judgments is \nbecoming more and more important in a world in which it is increasingly easy for \nenterprises and individuals to have assets in more than one State and to move assets \nacross borders,  \n \nConsidering that international instruments on the recognition and enforcement \nof judgments in civil and commercial matters exclude insolvency-related judgments \nfrom their scope,  \n \nConcerned that inadequate coordination and cooperation in cases of cross-\nborder insolvency, which lead to uncertainties associated with recognition and \nenforcement of insolvency-related judgments, can operate as an obstacle to the fair, \nefficient and effective administration of cross-border insolvencies, reducing the \npossibility of rescuing financially troubled but viable businesses, making it more \nlikely that debtors\u2019 assets would be concealed or dissipated and hindering \nreorganizations or liquidations that would be the most advantageous for all interested \npersons, including the debtors, the debtors\u2019 employees and the creditors, \n\nA/RES/73/200 \nModel Law on Recognition and Enforcement of Insolvency Related Judgments\nof the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law\n \n18-22462\n2/2 \n \n \nConvinced that fair and internationally standardized legislation on cross-border \ninsolvency that respects national procedural and judicial systems, as expressed by the \nprovisions of the Model Law on Recognition and Enforcement of Insolvency-Related \nJudgments,1 that is acceptable to States with different legal, social and economic \nsystems would contribute to the development of international trade and investment, \n \n1. \nExpresses its appreciation to the United Nations Commission on \nInternational Trade Law for finalizing and adopting the Model Law on Recognition \nand Enforcement of Insolvency-Related Judgments1 and its guide to enactment; \n \n2. \nRequests the Secretary-General to transmit the text of the Model Law, \ntogether with its guide to enactment, to Governments and other interested bodies; \n \n3. \nRecommends that all States give favourable consideration to the Model \nLaw when revising or adopting legislation relevant to insolvency, bearing in mind the \nneed for internationally harmonized legislation governing and facilitating instances \nof cross-border insolvency, and invites States that have used the Model Law to advise \nthe Commission accordingly;  \n \n4. \nAlso recommends that all States continue to consider implementation of \nthe Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency of the United Nations Commission on \nInternational Trade Law.2  \n \n62nd plenary meeting  \n20 December 2018 \n \n__________________ \n \n1  Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-third Session, Supplement No. 17 (A/73/17), \nannex III. \n \n2  Resolution 52/158, annex. \n",
