We \nwelcome the designation of 30 July as the World Day against Trafficking in \nPersons.3 \n4. \nWe reiterate our strong condemnation of trafficking in persons, especially \nwomen and children, which continues to pose a serious challenge to humanity, \nviolates and impairs the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and \nconstitutes a crime and a serious threat to human dignity and physical integrity, and \na challenge to sustainable development, and which requires the implementation of a \ncomprehensive approach that includes partnerships and measures to prevent such \ntrafficking, to prosecute and punish the traffickers and to identify and protect the \nvictims, as well as a criminal justice response commensurate to the serious nature of \nthe crime. In this regard, we encourage the development of policies, programmes \nand national strategies to prevent and combat trafficking in persons. \n5. \nWe reaffirm the crucial importance of universal ratification of the United \nNations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 4 and the Protocol to \nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \nChildren, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational \nOrganized Crime,5 taking into consideration the central role of those instruments in \nthe fight against trafficking in persons, and urge Member States that have not yet \ndone so to consider ratifying or acceding to the Convention and the Protocol to \nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \nChildren, as a matter of priority. We urge States parties to those instruments to \nimplement them fully and effectively, and welcome the decision of the Conference \nof the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized \nCrime to continue the process of establishing a mechanism for the review of the \nimplementation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto. \n6. \nWe also reaffirm the importance of universal ratification and implementation \nof other relevant international instruments that address trafficking in persons. \n7. \nWe reaffirm our recognition that \u201ctrafficking in persons\u201d shall mean the \nrecruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of \nthe threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of \ndeception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or \nreceiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control \nover another person, for the purpose of exploitation, which includes, at a minimum, \nthe exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, \nforced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the \nremoval of organs, as set forth in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish \nTrafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. \n8. \nWe express solidarity with and compassion for victims and survivors, call for \nfull respect of their human rights, and, recognizing their role as agents of change in \nthe global fight against trafficking in persons, encourage further consideration of \nincorporating their perspective and experience in all efforts to prevent and combat \ntrafficking in persons. We will provide appropriate care, assistance and services for \ntheir recovery and rehabilitation, working with civil society and other relevant \npartners. We will also undertake appropriate measures for access to justice and \nprotections for victims in criminal justice processes, including measures to ensure \nthat identified victims are not penalized for having been trafficked and that they do \n__________________ \n \n3  See resolution 68/192. \n \n4  United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2225, No. 39574. \n \n5  Ibid., vol. 2237, No. 39574. \n\nPolitical declaration on the implementation of the United Nations \nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons \nA/RES/72/1\n \n3/6 \n17-30057 \n \nnot suffer from victimization as a result of actions taken by Government authorities, \ncommunities and families. \n9. \nWe commit to intensify our efforts to prevent and address, with a view to \neliminating, the demand that fosters trafficking, especially of women and girls, for \nall forms of exploitation, and in this regard to put in place or to enhance preventive \nmeasures, including legislative and punitive measures, to deter exploiters of \ntrafficked persons, as well as ensure their accountability. \n10. We reaffirm our commitment to continue our efforts to criminalize trafficking \nin persons in all its forms, and to strengthen cooperation and coordination among \nMember States in countries of origin, transit and destination in order to disrupt and \ndismantle criminal networks involved in such crimes, including through, inter alia, \nthe enhancement of information-sharing with full respect for domestic law and \nmutual legal assistance in combating crimes that might be connected with \ntrafficking in persons, such as money-laundering, corruption, illicit financial flows, \nthe smuggling of migrants and all forms of organized crime. We commit to \nenhancing the capacity of law enforcement and criminal justice systems to identify, \ninvestigate and prosecute cases of trafficking in persons, to analyse financial flows \nand to detect those criminal networks. \n11. \nWe are seriously concerned that the scale of global resourcing to fight \ntrafficking in persons does not match the scale of the challenge and in this regard: \n \n(a) \nWe reaffirm our strong support for the United Nations voluntary trust \nfund for victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, \nestablished in accordance with the Global Plan of Action, aimed at providing \nvictims of trafficking in persons with humanitarian, legal and financial aid through \nestablished channels of assistance, such as governmental, intergovernmental and \nnon-governmental organizations, and we invite all stakeholders to contribute to the \ntrust fund, including through the announcement of pledges at the quadrennial \nhigh-level appraisals of the Global Plan of Action; \n \n(b) \nWe stress the need to intensify international cooperation, including \ncapacity-building and technical assistance, especially for developing countries, \naimed at strengthening their ability to prevent all forms of trafficking, including \nsupporting their development programmes. \n12. We also stress the need to ensure overall organization and coherence in the \nefforts of the United Nations system to respond to trafficking in persons, especially \nin ensuring support to Member States. In this regard, while recalling that the \nInter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons was established to \nfoster coordination and cooperation among relevant United Nations system entities \nand other international organizations involved in combating trafficking in persons, \nwith the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime as its coordinator, we urge the \nSecretary-General to continue efforts to strengthen coordination within the United \nNations system and to inform Member States thereof through existing reporting \nchannels. \n13. We recognize the important role played by the Inter-Agency Coordination \nGroup against Trafficking in Persons in the United Nations system, and invite it to \ncontinue to increase its activities related to the implementation of the Global Plan of \nAction and, to that end, to incorporate aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment relevant to preventing and combating trafficking in persons and to \nconsider how future activities will be coordinated and how the duplication of efforts \nwill be avoided. We encourage the Coordination Group to expand its working group \nto include entities of the United Nations system that are not currently active in the \nworking group but that have a role in addressing trafficking in persons. \n\nA/RES/72/1 \nPolitical declaration on the implementation of the United Nations\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons\n \n17-30057 \n4/6 \n \n14. We reaffirm the central role of the work of the United Nations Office on Drugs \nand Crime in the global fight against trafficking in persons, particularly in providing \ntechnical assistance to Member States, upon their request, to implement the United \nNations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to \nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \nChildren, by making use of existing capacity-building tools, lessons learned from \nMember States and expertise available in other international organizations. \n15. We reaffirm the important contribution to the global fight against trafficking in \npersons of the other members of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against \nTrafficking in Persons, in particular the Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Human Rights, the Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the United \nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), \nthe International Labour Organization, the International Organization for Migration, \nthe International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other intergovernmental \norganizations, within their respective mandates. \n16. We reiterate the need for improved data collection and analysis of trafficking \nin persons, disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant factors, including the form \nof exploitation, to effectively counter trafficking in persons. We thus recognize the \nimportance of improved data collection by national authorities and will enhance \ninternational cooperation to this end, including through capacity-building, financial \nsupport and technical assistance. We will do so consistent with our national \nlegislations on data protection, if applicable, and our international obligations \nrelated to privacy, as applicable. \n17. We acknowledge the importance of the biennial Global Report on Trafficking \nin Persons, prepared by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime pursuant to \nthe Global Plan of Action, and request the Office to continue to collect information \non patterns, forms and flows of trafficking in persons, at the national, regional and \ninternational levels, in a balanced, reliable and comprehensive manner, to be \npublished in the Global Report, and in ongoing research to estimate the prevalence \nof trafficking in persons, in close cooperation and collaboration with Member \nStates. \n18. We recall the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants,6 in which, \ninter alia, it was recognized that refugees and migrants in large movements are at \ngreater risk of being trafficked and of being subjected to forced labour. We will \nprovide support for the victims of trafficking in persons and work to prevent \ntrafficking in persons among those affected by displacement, including through \ntargeted measures to identify victims of trafficking in persons or those at risk of \ntrafficking. We reiterate our commitment to take steps to address the particular \nvulnerabilities of women and children during the journey from country of origin to \ncountry of arrival, including their potential exposure to trafficking in persons, \nincluding through the development of age- and gender-sensitive policies and \nprogrammes. \n19. We express our serious concern over the increase in the number of women and \nchildren who are being trafficked, recognize that trafficking in persons \ndisproportionately affects them, and call upon Member States to establish \ncomprehensive policies, programmes and other measures to protect trafficked \n__________________ \n \n6  Resolution 71/1. \n\nPolitical declaration on the implementation of the United Nations \nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons \nA/RES/72/1\n \n5/6 \n17-30057 \n \nwomen and children from revictimization and to provide appropriate assistance and \nprotection in the best interest of the child. \n20. We recognize that the issue of trafficking in persons in situations of armed \nconflict and humanitarian emergencies, including natural disasters, requires further \nattention. We encourage the training of humanitarian and peacekeeping personnel to \nbe deployed in humanitarian emergencies and peacekeeping operations on \nresponding to trafficking in persons and on gender expertise, child protection and \nsexual exploitation. We encourage all entities and bodies of the United Nations \nsystem to train their personnel and to build their technical capacity to assess \nsituations for instances of trafficking in persons in armed conflict and humanitarian \nemergencies, and to work together to identify, prevent and respond effectively to \nvictims of trafficking. \n21. We express our deep concern about the increasing links in some regions \nbetween armed groups, including terrorist groups, and trafficking in persons, \ninvolving the coercion of women and girls into marriages or sexual slavery, and \npressing men and boys to act as forced labour or combatants. \n22. We note with concern the criminal misuse of information and communications \ntechnologies, in particular the Internet, to facilitate trafficking in persons, and \nemphasize the importance of countering such use while respecting human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, including the right to privacy, in compliance with other \nobligations under international law. \n23. We reaffirm that the crime of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ \nremoval constitutes a form of exploitation and an offence against the human dignity \nof the victims, and condemn the involvement of criminal groups and unethical \nmedical personnel in trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal. \n24. We reiterate, in the strongest terms possible, the importance of strengthening \ncollective action by Member States to end trafficking in persons, including through \nregional, subregional and cross-regional mechanisms, and through partnerships and \ninitiatives with the United Nations system and other stakeholders, including, inter \nalia, regional and international organizations, the private sector, the media, \nparliamentarians and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, \nacademic institutions and faith-based organizations, as well as national human \nrights institutions, where they exist, with regard to the Paris Principles. 7 In \nparticular, we underline the work of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights \nCouncil on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and the Special \nRapporteur of the Human Rights Council on contemporary forms of slavery, in \ncombating trafficking in persons, and welcome their continued efforts to implement \nthe Global Plan of Action and the present political declaration. \n25. We will promote partnerships and engage the business community and civil \nsociety, including non-governmental organizations, in developing and implementing \nsustainable initiatives to prevent and combat trafficking in persons in supply chains, \ntaking into account the views and experiences of trafficked persons in designing, \nimplementing, monitoring and evaluating such initiatives, and encourage businesses \nto support efforts to combat trafficking in persons. We urge the Secretary-General to \nensure that all United Nations procurement is free from trafficking in persons. \n__________________ \n \n7  Resolution 48/134, annex. \n\nA/RES/72/1 \nPolitical declaration on the implementation of the United Nations\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons\n \n17-30057 \n6/6 \n \n26.
