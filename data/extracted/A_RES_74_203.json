partnership and solidarity, \n \nReaffirming further the Paris Agreement,1 and encouraging all its parties to fully \nimplement the Agreement, and parties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change 2  that have not yet done so to deposit their instruments of \nratification, acceptance, approval or accession, where appropriate, as soon as possible, \n \nRecalling the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its \nImpact on Development and its outcome document,3 \n \nRecalling also the 2019 Economic and Social Council forum on financing for

cuts in public spending, \nincluding on health and education, affecting the poor and vulnerable in particular, \n \nReaffirming that each country has primary responsibility for its own \ndevelopment, including through maintaining its own debt sustainability, and that the \nrole of national policies and development strategies, including in the area of debt \nmanagement, is central to the achievement of sustainable development, and \nrecognizing that national efforts, including to achieve development goals and to \nmaintain debt sustainability, should be complemented by supportive global \nprogrammes, measures and policies aimed at expanding the development \nopportunities of developing countries, while taking into account national conditions \nand ensuring respect for national ownership, strategies and sovereignty, \n \nReiterating that debt sustainability depends on a confluence of many factors at \nthe international and national levels, and emphasizing that country-specific \ncircumstances and the impact of external shocks, such as volatile commodity and \nenergy prices, more intense and frequent natural disasters and international capital \nflows, should continue to be taken into account in debt sustainability analyses, \n \nExpressing concern about the adverse impact of the continuing fragility of the \nglobal economy and the slow pace of the restoration of global growth and trade, \nincluding the impact on development, cognizant that the global economy remains in \na challenging phase, with many downside risks, including net negative capital flows \nfrom some emerging and developing economies, continued low commodity prices, \nhigh unemployment, in particular among young people, women, persons with \ndisabilities and other people in vulnerable situations, and rising private and public \nindebtedness in many developing countries, and stressing the need for continuing \nefforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances and to reform and strengthen \nthe international financial system while implementing the reforms agreed upon to date \nto attend to these challenges and to make progress towards sustaining global demand, \n \nExpressing deep concern that global growth has remained strongly dependent \non unprecedented increases in global debt stocks in the years since the global financial \ncrisis, and, in conjunction

of debt refinancing, exposes a \ngrowing number of developing economies to highly sensitive and amplified reactions \nto even mildly adverse economic developments, or the perception of such, in financial \nmarkets, \n \nUnderlining that, globally, the gross domestic product growth rate could \nincrease significantly if every country achieved gender equality, and recognizing that \nthe economic and social losses owing to a lack of progress in achieving gender \nequality and the empowerment of women and girls are significant, \n \nRecognizing with concern that, by 2018, the external debt positions of many \ndeveloping countries had worsened again, with external debt stocks growing at a \ncumulative rate of almost 20 per cent for all developing countries over the past three \nyears alone and with the ratio of total external debt to gross domestic product \nincreasing to 29.1 per cent in 2018, compared with 23.3 per cent in 2011, and that the \nexternal debt positions of middle-income countries and small island developing States \nhave worsened, as stated in the report of the Secretary-General,5 \n \nRecognizing with concern also that small island developing States saw a sharp \nrise in 2003 in their total ratio of external debt to gross domestic product, which \nincreased from 19.8 per cent in 2000 to 85.6 per cent in 2003, and that by 2010, \nexternal debt stocks had surpassed their combined gross domestic product, with the \nratio reaching 118.9 per cent for small island developing States as a whole, \n \nRecognizing with concern further that total external debt stocks in middle-\nincome countries, excluding small island developing States, grew by 8 per cent per \nannum over the period from 2009 to 2018, total external debt has grown by over \n20 per cent since 2016 and the current debt represents 26.8 per cent of their combined \ngross domestic product, and that the debt of middle-income countries is not only \ngrowing at a faster pace than anticipated, but is a more costly debt with a shorter \nmaturity, \n \nRecognizing the important role, on a case-by-case basis, of debt relief, including \ndebt cancellation, as appropriate, and debt restructuring as debt crisis prevention, \nmanagement and resolution tools, \n \nRecalling the Sendai Declaration and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \nReduction 2015\u20132030, 6  reiterating that severe natural disasters and social or \neconomic shocks can undermine a country\u2019s debt sustainability, and noting that public \ncreditors have taken steps to ease debt repayment obligations through debt \nrescheduling and debt cancellation following an earthquake or a tsunami and in the \ncontext of the Ebola crisis in West Africa, noting the debt swap initiative of the \nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Debt for Climate \nAdaptation Swap, and encouraging consideration of further debt relief steps, such as \nthe use of sovereign contingent debt instruments, where appropriate, and/or other \nmeasures for countries affected in this regard, as feasible, \n \nExpressing deep concern that a number of countries in special situations, in \nparticular African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing \ncountries and small island developing States, as well as a growing number of middle-\nincome countries, face challenges in servicing their debt and that, in spite of \ninternational efforts, a growing number of developing countries continue to struggle \nwith high debt burdens and are classified, in accordance with the debt sustainability \nassessments, as being in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress, \n__________________ \n \n5 A/74/234. \n \n6 Resolution 69/283, annexes I and II. \n\nA/RES/74/203 \nExternal debt sustainability and development\n \n19-22416\n4/9 \n \n \nRecognizing the importance of debt sustainability for the smooth transition of \ncountries graduating from least developed country status, as well as those that have \nalready graduated, \n \nEmphasizing that international support, in the form of official development \nassistance and a coordinated multilateral effort to provide low-cost, long-term \ndevelopment financing, as well as enhanced domestic resource mobilization, which \nis the primary source of financing for development across all country classifications, \nare needed to address the growing challenges to developing countries\u2019 debt \nsustainability, \n \nTaking note of the operational guidelines for sustainable financing promoted by \nthe Group of 20, while urging the Group to continue to engage in an inclusive and \ntransparent manner with other States Members of the United Nations in its work, in \norder to ensure that the initiatives of the Group complement or strengthen the United \nNations system, and noting the progress achieved in the implementation of the \noperational guidelines, \n \nNoting the need for coordinated efforts by the International Monetary Fund and \nthe World Bank to promote responsible, transparent and sustainable lending and \nborrowing, including debt transparency, \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General;5 \n \n2. \nEmphasizes the special importance of timely, effective, comprehensive \nand durable solutions to the debt problems of developing countries to promote their \neconomic growth and development; \n \n3. \nRecognizes the importance, in particular, of new and emerging challenges \nand vulnerabilities in regard to developing country external debt sustainability arising \nfrom structural changes to overall debt composition, the rapid growth of private sector \ndebt in many emerging and developing countries and the growing use of new debt \nfinancing instruments and approaches; \n \n4. \nNotes the growing concerns about fast-rising corporate debt, high-risk \nexposure to volatile international financial markets and fast-growing debt servicing \nburdens as potential triggers of financial and debt crises and the consequent need for \ncoordinated policy responses; \n \n5. \nStresses the need to continue to assist developing countries in avoiding a \nbuild-up of unsustainable debt so as to reduce the risk of relapsing into another debt \ncrisis, taking into account the challenges posed by the global economic environment \nand risks for debt sustainability in some developed and developing countries; \n \n6. \nAcknowledges the role played by the Debt Sustainability Framework for \nLow-Income Countries, jointly developed by the International Monetary Fund and \nthe World Bank, to guide borrowing and lending decisions, and notes its \noperationalization in 2018 and the further enhancement of debt sustainability \nassessment frameworks, consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment7 and longer-term structural transformation; \n \n7. \nReiterates that no single indicator should be used to make definitive \njudgments about a country\u2019s debt sustainability, and, in view of the new challenges \nand vulnerabilities for developing countries\u2019 external debt sustainability, \nsubstantiated by the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment and recent joint analyses of the International Monetary Fund and the \nWorld Bank, stresses the need for improved data collection and quality in areas that \ninclude domestic public debt and domestic and external private debt, as well as legal \n__________________ \n \n7 Resolution 70/1. \n\nExternal debt sustainability and development \nA/RES/74/203\n \n5/9\n19-22416 \n \nand regulatory features, such as ownership, currency denomination and jurisdiction \naccording to national priorities; \n \n8. \nAlso reiterates that timely and comprehensive data on the level and \ncomposition of debt are necessary for, inter alia, building early warning systems \naimed at limiting the impact of debt crises, calls for debtor and creditor countries to \nintensify their efforts to collect and release data, where appropriate, welcomes the \nongoing work of relevant institutions to apply innovative tools for monitoring \nfinancial stress in developing countries and to create a central data registry that \nincludes information on debt restructuring, and calls for donors to consider increasing \ntheir support for technical cooperation programmes aimed at increasing the statistical \ncapacity of developing countries in that regard; \n \n9. \nEncourages the United Nations system, the World Bank Group, the \nInternational Monetary Fund and other relevant stakeholders, including the \nDevelopment Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development, to continue to conduct analytical activities and to provide policy \nadvice and technical assistance to Governments, upon request, in the areas of \nmanaging debt, and operating and maintaining databases, and in this regard recalls \nthat the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development should continue its \nanalytical and policy work and technical assistance on debt issues, including the Debt \nManagement and Financial Analysis System Programme, so that this extends not only \nto improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of debt data recording, but also to the \nenhanced coverage of public sector and other relevant debt data, including, in \nparticular, heretofore unrecorded or hidden debt instruments, contingent liabilities \nand more complex debt instruments; \n \n10. Stresses the need to strengthen information-sharing and transparency \namong all creditors and borrowers to make sure that debt sustainability assessments \nare based on comprehensive, objective and reliable data, including an assessment of \nnational public and private debt, in order to ensure the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, encourages further improvement of the mutual exchange of \ninformation, on a voluntary basis, on borrowing and lending among all creditors and \nborrowers, and takes note of the Paris Forum initiative, which is aimed at gathering \ntogether sovereign creditors and debtors to share views and information, promote \ngreater debt transparency and preserve debt sustainability; \n \n11. \nRecognizes that the long-term sustainability of debt depends on, inter alia, \neconomic growth, the mobilization of domestic and international resources, the export \nprospects of debtor countries, sustainable debt management, sound macroeconomic \npolicies that also support job creation, transparent and effective regulatory \nframeworks and success in overcoming structural development problems and, hence, \non the creation of an enabling environment at all levels that is conducive to \ndevelopment, and also recognizes the need to assist developing countries in attaining \nlong-term debt sustainability, through coordinated policies aimed at fostering \nadequate debt financing and resolution tools, such as debt relief and debt restructuring \nsupporting sound debt management; \n \n12. Notes with concern that some low- and middle-income developing \ncountries that were not part of the existing debt relief initiatives now have large debt \nburdens that may create constraints on mobilizing the resources needed to achieve the \nSustainable Development Goals, indicating a need to consider, as appropriate, \nstronger debt management initiatives for those countries, and stresses the importance \nof medium- and long-term debt sustainability to deal with debt, including bilateral \nand non-Paris Club debt; \n \n13. Underlines the fact that heavily indebted poor countries eligible for debt \nrelief will not be able to enjoy the full benefits unless all creditors, both public and \n\nA/RES/74/203 \nExternal debt sustainability and development\n \n19-22416\n6/9 \n \nprivate, contribute to debt workouts, as appropriate, in order to ensure the debt \nsustainability of those countries, and invites creditors, both private and public, that \nare not yet fully participating in debt relief initiatives to substantially increase their \nparticipation, including by providing comparable treatment, to the extent possible, to \ndebtor countries that have concluded sustainable debt relief agreements with \ncreditors; \n \n14. Stresses the need for the international community to remain vigilant in \nmonitoring the debt situation of developing countries, including the least developed \ncountries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, and to \ncontinue to take effective measures, preferably within existing frameworks, when \napplicable, to address the debt problem of those countries, acknowledges that sound \ndebt management initiatives can play a key role in liberating resources that should be \ndirected towards activities consistent with the eradication of poverty in all its forms \nand dimensions, including extreme poverty, and with the promotion of sustained \neconomic growth and development and the internationally agreed development goals, \nincluding the Sustainable Development Goals, and in this regard urges countries to \ndirect the resources freed through debt relief, in particular through debt cancellation \nand reduction, towards achieving those objectives, including in the context of the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, according to their national priorities and \nstrategies; \n \n15. Notes that countries can seek to negotiate, as a last resort, on a case-by-\ncase basis and through existing frameworks, agreements on temporary debt standstills \nbetween debtors and creditors in order to help to mitigate the adverse impacts of a \ndebt crisis and stabilize macroeconomic developments; \n \n16. Acknowledges the efforts of, and invites creditors to provide additional \nflexibility to, developing countries affected by natural disasters so as to allow them \nto address their national debt concerns, while taking into account their specific \neconomic and social situations and needs; \n \n17. Recognizes that the detrimental impact of disasters on the debt \nsustainability of many least developed countries, small island developing States and \nmiddle-income countries warrants further attention and that preserving external debt \nsustainability requires ex ante financing to enable the systematic reduction of disaster \nrisk and resilience-building, as well as the disclosure of disaster risk to avoid \nexacerbating debt distress, when feasible, and in this regard recognizes that many \nleast developed countries, small island developing States and middle-income \ncountries have limited access to financing to invest in disaster risk reduction for \nresilience before and after disasters; \n \n18. Also recognizes that, in some cases, the use of public debt and renewed \nexternal borrowing to absorb the impact of a natural disaster could lead to higher debt \nservicing for developing countries and constrain their growth and their capacity to \ninvest in long-term resilience-building measures, and further acknowledges that, with \neach new disaster, financial vulnerabilities grow and domestic response capacities \nweaken; \n \n19. Further recognizes the importance of the creation of robust, nationally \nappropriate legal and regulatory frameworks for sustainable national and municipal \nborrowing, on the basis of sustainable debt management, supported by adequate \nrevenues and capacities, by means of local creditworthiness, as well as expanded \nsustainable municipal debt markets, when appropriate, and in this regard underlines \nthe importance of the establishment of appropriate financial intermediaries for urban \nfinancing, such as regional, national, subnational and local development funds or \ndevelopment banks, including pooled financing mechanisms, which can catalyse \npublic and private, national and international financing; \n\nExternal debt sustainability and development \nA/RES/74/203\n \n7/9\n19-22416 \n \n \n20. Underlines the importance of multilateral efforts to tackle increasingly \ncomplex cross-border challenges that have serious effects on development and debt \nsustainability; \n \n21. Recognizes the role of the United Nations and of the international financial \ninstitutions, in accordance with their respective mandates, and encourages them to \ncontinue to support global efforts towards sustained and inclusive growth, sustainable \ndevelopment and the external debt sustainability of developing countries, including \nthrough continued monitoring of global financial flows and their implications in this \nregard; \n \n22. Reiterates that debtors and creditors must work together in a transparent \nmanner to prevent and resolve unsustainable debt situations and that maintaining \nsustainable debt levels is the responsibility of the borrowing countries, acknowledges \nthat lenders also have a responsibility to lend in a way that does not undermine a \ncountry\u2019s debt sustainability, and in this regard takes note of the principles on \nresponsible sovereign lending and borrowing of the United Nations Conference on \nTrade and Development, recognizes the applicable requirements of the debt limits \npolicy of the International Monetary Fund and/or the non-concessional borrowing \npolicy of the World Bank and the safeguards of the Development Assistance \nCommittee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in its \nstatistical system to enhance the debt sustainability of recipient countries, and \nresolves to work towards a global consensus on guidelines for debtor and creditor \nresponsibilities in borrowing by and lending to sovereigns, building on existing \ninitiatives; \n \n23. Calls for the intensification of efforts to prevent and mitigate the \nprevalence and cost of debt crises by enhancing international financial mechanisms \nfor crisis prevention and resolution, encourages the private sector to cooperate in this \nregard, and invites creditors and debtors to further explore, where appropriate and on \na mutually agreed, transparent and case-by-case basis, the use of new and improved \ndebt instruments such as debt swaps, including debt for equity in Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal projects, as well as debt indexation instruments; \n \n24. Notes the holding of the twelfth session of the International Debt \nManagement Conference in Geneva from 18 to 20 November 2019, and encourages \nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund to continue their analytical and policy work and \ntechnical assistance on debt issues and to promote policies for responsible, \nsustainable and transparent sovereign borrowing and lending, as appropriate; \n \n25. Expresses its concern regarding the ability of non-cooperative minority \nbondholders to disrupt the will of the large majority of bondholders who accept a \nrestructuring of a debt-crisis country\u2019s obligations, given the potential broader \nimplications in other countries, notes legislative steps taken by certain countries to \nprevent these activities and encourage all Governments to take action, as appropriate, \nand, furthermore, takes note of discussions in the United Nations on debt issues; \n \n26. Encourages Governments to be mindful of the ability of non-cooperative \nminority bondholders to block a restructuring of a debt-crisis country\u2019s obligations, \nand encourages debtors and creditors to work together to draft bond agreements \naccordingly; \n \n27. Welcomes the reforms to pari passu and collective action clauses proposed \nby the International Capital Market Association and endorsed by the International \nMonetary Fund to reduce the vulnerability of sovereigns to holdout creditors, \nencourages countries to take further action to include those clauses in all their bond \nissuances, and welcomes the continued work of the International Monetary Fund to \n\nA/RES/74/203 \nExternal debt sustainability and development\n \n19-22416\n8/9 \n \nmonitor the uptake of the clauses and explore options for resolving the issue with the \noutstanding stock of debt without such clauses; \n \n28. Recalls that the United Nations, as a universal intergovernmental body, \nhas provided a platform for both creditors and debtors to discuss ways to improve \nexternal debt sustainability, notes the substantive expert debate among the major \ninstitutional stakeholders on how to improve debt sustainability and debt restructuring \nduring the 2019 Economic and Social Council forum on financing for development \nfollow-up, and in this regard invites continued ongoing cooperation among the \ninternational financial institutions, including the Bretton Woods institutions, in \nparticular the International Monetary Fund, relevant United Nations system entities, \nincluding the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and other \nrelevant forums, in accordance with their respective mandates, pursuant to the \nrelevant resolutions on this matter; \n \n29. Also recalls the establishment of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts \non Financing for Development of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment, notes its meeting held in Geneva in November 2018, at which the issue \nof debt sustainability was an item for deliberation, and recalls the request that the \nwork of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts be presented as a regular input to the \nforum on financing for development follow-up, in accordance with the terms of \nreference of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts; \n \n30. Reiterates the invitation to the President of the General Assembly and the \nSecretary-General to give appropriate consideration to the central role of maintaining \nand facilitating the financial and macroeconomic stability of developing countries, \nincluding debt sustainability, and of supporting an appropriately enabling domestic \nand international economic, financial and regulatory environment for the means of \nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and in this regard \ninvites all major institutional stakeholders, including the International Monetary \nFund, the World Bank and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \nto support these efforts, in accordance with their respective mandates; \n \n31. Encourages Member States, the United Nations system, the World Bank \nGroup, the International Monetary Fund and other relevant stakeholders, and \ninternational financial institutions to scale up technical assistance in debt \nmanagement, including debt data recording and reporting, and to provide greater \ncoordination of advice, for the delivery of such technical assistance upon request, and \nto ensure synergies with the full spectrum of debt management mechanisms; \n \n32. Invites donor countries, taking into account country-specific debt \nsustainability analyses, to continue their provision of concessional and grant-based \nfinancing to developing countries, which could contribute to debt sustainability in the \nmedium to long term, and notes the provision by the International Monetary Fund of \ninterest relief to eligible developing countries in the form of zero-interest loans; \n \n33. Invites the international community to continue efforts to increase support, \nincluding financial and technical assistance, for institutional capacity-building in \ndeveloping countries to enhance sustainable upstream and downstream debt \nmanagement as an integral part of national development strategies, including by \npromoting transparent and accountable debt management systems and negotiation and \nrenegotiation capacities and through supporting legal advice in relation to tackling \nexternal debt litigation and debt data reconciliation between creditors and debtors so \nthat debt sustainability may be achieved and maintained; \n \n34. Requests the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and \ninvites the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in cooperation with the \nregional commissions, regional development banks and other relevant multilateral \n\nExternal debt sustainability and development \nA/RES/74/203\n \n9/9\n19-22416 \n \nfinancial institutions and stakeholders, to continue and intensify cooperation in \nrespect of activities relating to capacity-building and to early warning monitoring \nsystems in developing countries in the area of debt management and debt \nsustainability, with a view to contributing to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda \nfor Sustainable Development; \n \n35. Calls upon all Member States and the United Nations system to take \nappropriate measures and actions for the implementation of the commitments, \nagreements and decisions of the major United Nations conferences and summits, in \nparticular those related to the question of the external debt sustainability of \ndeveloping countries; \n \n36.
