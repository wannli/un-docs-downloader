\nmetals, rhinoceros horns and ivory, of piracy and money-laundering and of the fact \nthat crime is a major obstacle to harmonious and sustainable development in Africa, \n \nDeeply concerned about the growing links, in some cases, between some forms \nof transnational organized crime and terrorism, and recognizing that countering \ntransnational organized crime and terrorism is a common and

\nEmphasizing that combating crime is a collective endeavour to meet the global \nchallenge of organized crime and that investment of necessary resources in crime \nprevention is important to that aim and contributes to sustainable development, \n \nNoting with concern that in most African countries the existing criminal justice \nsystem does not have sufficiently skilled personnel and adequate infrastructure and is \ntherefore ill-equipped to manage the emergence of new crime trends, and \nacknowledging the challenges that Africa faces in litigation processes and the \nmanagement of correctional institutions, \n \nRecognizing that the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of \nCrime and the Treatment of Offenders is a focal point for professional efforts aimed \nat promoting the active cooperation and collaboration of Governments, academics, \ninstitutions and scientific and professional organizations and experts in crime \nprevention and criminal justice, \n \nBearing in mind the African Union Plan of Action on Drug Control and Crime \nPrevention (2019\u20132023), aimed at encouraging Member States to participate in and \nown the regional initiatives for

Institute, and \nnoting the important role of such senior management positions in ensuring the normal \nfunctioning of the Institute, \n \nNoting with concern that the financial situation of the Institute has greatly \naffected its capacity to deliver services to African Member States in an effective and \ncomprehensive manner, and noting that one of the findings of the preliminary \ndiagnostic study is that the Institute urgently needs to increase its income, \n \nRecognizing the ongoing efforts by the Governing Board of the Institute to \nmobilize States members of the Institute, with a view to obtaining and reaffirming \ntheir financial commitment to the Institute, in line with the decision of the Board, \ntaken in Addis Ababa on 18 February 2020, to address the decline in financial support \nfor the programmes of the Institute,  \n \nRecalling the detailed description provided in the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral2 of funding deficiencies that have severely undermined the capacity of the \nInstitute to serve the needs of the region, and recognizing that crime results in the \nexpenditure of a significant amount of resources, \n \nBearing in mind that the Institute is an important component of the United \nNations crime prevention and criminal justice network and that, without the necessary \nfunds, the Institute will fail to accomplish its vital goals of combating drug \ntrafficking, cybercrime and environmental crimes, among other challenges, as well as \nits goals of reforming the crucial deficiencies in the region\u2019s prosecution
