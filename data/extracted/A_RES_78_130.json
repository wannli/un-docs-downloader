health-care waste, \nand, furthermore, 1 billion people access health-care facilities without reliable \nelectricity or without electricity access at all, underscoring the grave implications of \nnot having these basic services, especially the 8 million people that die annually from \npoor-quality care, resulting in 6 trillion United States dollars in losses,  \n \nDeeply concerned also that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation \nservices, including for menstrual health and hygiene management in health-care \nfacilities, negatively affects gender equality, the empowerment of women and girls and \ntheir enjoyment of human rights, including the right to the enjoyment of the highest \nattainable standard of physical and mental health, and recognizing the specific hygiene

practicable and with the least possible delay, the medical care and attention \nrequired, \n \nTaking note of the work of the World Health Organization and the United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund through the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, \nSanitation and Hygiene, and their global leadership and coordination of efforts to \nimprove water, sanitation, hygiene and electricity in health-care facilities, and of the \nbaseline reports and progress updates for the provision of safe drinking water and \nsanitation in health-care facilities, and the articulation of evidence-based actions and \ntools to improve services, including Water and Sanitation for Health Facility \nImprovement,  \n \nTaking note of World Health Assembly resolution 72.7 of 28 May 2019 on water, \nsanitation and hygiene in health-care facilities8 and subsequent global progress reports \nhighlighting the large gaps in services as well as the reports on the practical actions, \nwhile noting that progress is greatest in establishing baselines and strengthening \nstandards and least in integrating these with health systems, including through \nimproving water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure, training and education, \n \nEmphasizing the importance of a coordinated, strategic response that accelerates \naction and investments at the global, regional and national levels, taking into \nconsideration, as appropriate, the main recommendations contained in the most recent \nglobal progress report of the World Health Organization and the United Nations \n__________________
