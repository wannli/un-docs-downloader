contains a set of political commitments for \nstrengthening and promoting existing initiatives on, and addressing existing gaps in, \nthrough-life conventional ammunition management, and emphasizing the importance \nof its early and full implementation, \n \nExpressing grave concern over the risks posed by the diversion of conventional \nammunition of all types and calibres to unauthorized recipients, including criminals, \norganized criminal groups and terrorists, their trafficking into illicit markets, \nincluding their subsequent use in the manufacture of improvised explosive devices, \nas well as their contribution to the intensity and duration of armed conflict, armed \nviolence, including gender-based armed violence, around the world, and the threat \nthat their diversion and illicit trafficking poses to peace, security, stability and \nsustainable development at the national, subregional, regional and global levels, \n \nExpressing grave concern also over the destruction caused by unplanned \nexplosions of conventional ammunition at ammunition sites, which claim thousands \nof lives, disrupt communities\u2019 livelihoods, and can generate severe humanitarian, \nhuman rights, socioeconomic, environmental and public health impacts,  \n \nRecognizing that gaps exist to achieving a discernible reduction in the risks and \nimpacts arising from the ineffective through-life management of conventional \nammunition around the world, extending from the point of manufacture, through \npre\u2011transfer, transfer, relocation and transport, stockpiling and recovery, to their \neventual use or disposal, and to this end stressing the importance of addressing the \nsafety and security risks and impacts emanating from the ineffective through-life

right of each State to legally manufacture, acquire, stockpile, \nmanage and transfer conventional ammunition, including for its self-defence and \nsecurity needs, as well as for its capacity to participate in peace operations, in a \nmanner consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, \n \nRecognizing that responsibility for addressing the risks associated with \nineffective through-life conventional ammunition management falls to States, \nconsistent with national laws, and underlining the importance of all States assuming \nstrong national ownership in the through-life management of conventional \nammunition, \n \nRecognizing also the importance of international cooperation and assistance in \npursuing and supporting safe, secure and sustainable through-life conventional \nammunition management nationally, subregionally, regionally and globally,  \n \nStressing the need for international cooperation among all States and other \nrelevant stakeholders on through-life conventional ammunition management, and \nacknowledging the support that they can provide, where appropriate and feasible, to \nStates in addressing the risks posed by ineffective
