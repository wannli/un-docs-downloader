the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating \npoverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest \nglobal challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its \ncommitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions \u2013 \neconomic, social and environmental \u2013 in a balanced and integrated manner, and to \nbuilding upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking \nto address their unfinished business,  \n \nRecalling the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 1 and

review of the effectiveness of the international \narrangement on forests in achieving its objectives, and the declaration of the high-\nlevel segment of the nineteenth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests,  \n \nStressing that the sustainable management of forests and trees outside forests is \nvital to the integrated implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment, including achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, especially \nGoal 15,  \n \nEmphasizing the continuous need to increase the visibility of the social, \neconomic and environmental benefits of forests and sustainable forest management \nand place them as an important component of responses to global challenges, and in \nthis regard noting recent forest-related declarations, pledges and developments, \nincluding but not limited to the forest-relevant contributions of the Glasgow Leaders\u2019 \nDeclaration on Forests and Land Use and the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem \nRestoration (2021\u20132030),  \n \nRecognizing that forests provide essential ecosystem services, such as timber, \nfood, fuel, fodder, non-wood products and shelter, as well as contribute to soil and \nwater conservation and clean air, prevent land degradation and desertification and \nreduce the risk of floods, landslides, avalanches, droughts, dust storms, sandstorms \nand other natural disasters, and contribute substantially to climate change mitigation \nand adaptation and to the conservation of biodiversity,  \n \nRecognizing also the valuable contributions of Indigenous Peoples as well as \nlocal communities, where applicable, in sustainable forest management, including \nafforestation and reforestation, in degraded lands, including drylands, and therefore \nfurther recognizing the need to promote their full and meaningful participation in \nforest-related decision-making, contributing to better conserving and managing \nforests,  \n \nRecognizing further the vital role that women play in the conservation and \nsustainable use of biological diversity, and reaffirming the need for their full, equal, \neffective and meaningful participation at all levels of policymaking and \nimplementation for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, as \nwell as ecosystem restoration,  \n \nRecognizing the Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing \nConservation of Terrestrial Habitats to prevent, halt and reverse land degradation \nadopted by the leaders of the Group of 20 in Riyadh in 2020, as well as the Riyadh

reforestation through tree planting, seeding and regeneration in degraded lands, \nincluding drylands, can have economic, social and environmental benefits inter alia \nby increasing biodiversity, providing habitat for diverse plant and animal species, \nprotecting against natural hazards and disasters, contributing substantially to climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation, particularly by absorbing and storing carbon \ndioxide from the atmosphere, as well as providing opportunities for agroforestry and \necotourism;  \n \n2. \nAlso emphasizes the need to ensure that afforestation and reforestation \nactivities are carried out in line with sustainable forest management and that they do \nnot lead to the degradation of non-forested natural ecosystems; \n \n3. \nStrives to strengthen
