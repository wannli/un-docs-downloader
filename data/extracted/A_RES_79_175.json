contributing to adverse human rights impacts through \ntheir own activities, and address such impacts as they occur, and that business \nenterprises seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly \nlinked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even \nif they have not contributed to those impacts,  \n \nNoting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all \nover the world to use new information and communications technologies that empower \npeople, improve lives, strengthen justice and boost productivity, and at the same time \nenhances the capacity of Governments, business enterprises and individuals to \nundertake surveillance, interception, hacking and data collection, which may violate \nor abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant \non Civil and Political Rights, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, \n \nNoting also that violations and abuses of the right to privacy in the digital \nage can affect all individuals, with particular effects on women, children, in particular \ngirls, persons with disabilities and older persons, as well as those in vulnerable \nsituations, \n \nRecognizing that new and emerging digital technologies, in particular assistive \ndigital technologies, can especially contribute to the full enjoyment of human rights \nby persons with disabilities, and that these technologies should be designed in \nconsultation with them and with appropriate safeguards to protect their rights, \nincluding their right to privacy, \n \nRecognizing also that the promotion of and respect for the right to privacy are \nimportant to the prevention of violence, including gender-based violence, abuse and \nsexual harassment, in particular against women and children, as well as any form of \ndiscrimination, which can occur in digital and online spaces and includes \ncyberbullying and cyberstalking,  \n \nNoting that women and girls experience specific violations and abuses of their \nright to privacy, both online and offline, as well as violations or abuses that have \ngender-specific impacts, and recognizing that the way in which many digital \nplatforms are designed, commercialized, maintained and governed can give rise to \ndisinformation and hate speech, which can exacerbate gender stereotypes and result \nin various forms of violence, including gender-based violence, and expressing \nconcern about the continuity and interrelation between offline and online violence, \nharassment and discrimination against women and girls, and condemning the increase \nof such acts that are committed, assisted, aggravated or amplified by the use of \ntechnology,  \n \nNoting also that children can be particularly vulnerable to abuses and violations \nof their right to privacy,  \n \nNoting further that States parties should implement the Convention on the \nRights of the Child24 in relation to the digital environment, including the importance \nof privacy to children\u2019s agency, dignity and safety, and for the exercise of their rights, \n \nReaffirming the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be \nsubjected to arbitrary or unlawful

of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection \nof honour and reputation,25 while also noting the vast technological leaps that have \ntaken place since its adoption and the need to discuss the right to privacy in view of \nthe challenges of the digital age,  \n \nRecognizing the need to further discuss and analyse, based on international \nhuman rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to \nprivacy in the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and \nremedies, the impact of surveillance on the right to privacy and other human rights, \nas well as the need to examine the principles of non-arbitrariness, lawfulness, legality, \nnecessity and proportionality in relation to surveillance practices,  \n \nRecognizing also that the discussion on the right to privacy should be based \nupon existing international and domestic legal obligations, including international \nhuman rights law, as well as relevant commitments, and should not open the path for \nundue interference with an individual\u2019s human rights,  \n \nRecognizing further the need to ensure that international human rights \nobligations are respected in the conception, design, development, deployment, \nevaluation and regulation of data-driven technologies and to ensure that they are \nsubject to adequate safeguards and oversight, \n \nStressing the importance of full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and \nimpart information, including the fundamental importance of access to information \nand democratic participation,  \n \nRecognizing that the right to privacy is important for the enjoyment of other \nrights and can contribute to an individual\u2019s ability to participate in political, \neconomic, social and cultural life, and noting with concern that violations or abuses \nof the right to be free from unlawful or arbitrary interference with the right to privacy \nmight affect the enjoyment of other human rights, including the right to freedom of \nexpression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to peaceful \nassembly and freedom of association,  \n \nNoting that, while metadata may provide benefits, certain types of metadata, \nwhen aggregated, can reveal personal information that can be no less sensitive than \nthe actual content of communications and can give an insight into an individual\u2019s \nbehaviour, social relationships, private preferences and identity,  \n \nExpressing concern that individuals, particularly children, often do not and/or \ncannot provide their free, explicit and informed consent to the collection, processing \nand storage of their data or to the reuse, sale or multiple resale of their personal data, \nas the collection, processing, use, storage and sharing of personal data, including \nsensitive data, have increased significantly in the digital age,  \n \nNoting that general comment No. 16 of the Human Rights Committee \nrecommends that States take effective measures to prevent the unlawful retention, \nprocessing and use of personal data stored by public authorities and business \nenterprises,  \n \nNoting also that the use of artificial intelligence can contribute to the promotion \nand protection of human rights and has the potential to transform Governments and \n__________________ \n \n25 Official Records of the General

work and can also have various far-\nreaching implications, including with regard to the right to privacy,  \n \nNoting further that the observance of the principles of transparency, \nexplainability and, where applicable, users\u2019 meaningful consent in the processing of \npersonal data using artificial intelligence not only helps to build trust and reliability \nin artificial intelligence technologies, but also contributes to the protection of human \nrights, including by enabling individuals affected by artificial intelligence \ntechnologies to be informed in a timely, comprehensive, simple and clear manner \nabout basic issues concerning the use of their personal information in artificial \nintelligence processes or projects and the consequences thereof, and about the specific \nreasons behind such use,  \n \nNoting with concern that artificial intelligence and other digital divides between \nand within countries continue to widen, and developing countries face unique \nchallenges in keeping pace with the rapid acceleration of artificial intelligence \ndevelopment, in particular in terms of the design, development, deployment and use \nof artificial intelligence,  \n \nNoting with concern also that the use of artificial intelligence or machine-\nlearning technologies, including for tools such as remote biometric identification, \nfacial recognition technology or automated content moderation, without proper \ntechnical, regulatory, legal and ethical safeguards, may lead to decisions that have the \npotential to affect the enjoyment of human rights, including economic, social and \ncultural rights, and affect non-discrimination, and recognizing the need to apply \ninternational human rights law and data protection frameworks in the design, \nevaluation and regulation of these practices,  \n \nRecognizing that, while the use of artificial intelligence can have significant \npositive economic and social impacts, it requires and allows for the processing of \nlarge amounts of data, often relating to personal data, including biometric data and \ndata on an individual\u2019s behaviour, social relationships, race or ethnicity, religion or \nbelief, which can pose serious risks to the enjoyment of the right to privacy, especially \nwhen done without proper safeguards, in particular when employed for identification, \ntracking, profiling, facial recognition, classification, behaviour prediction or scoring \nof individuals,  \n \nNoting that the use of artificial intelligence may, without proper technical, \nregulatory, legal and ethical safeguards, pose the risk of reinforcing discrimination, \nincluding structural inequalities, and recognizing that racially and otherwise \ndiscriminatory outcomes should be prevented in the design, development, \nimplementation and use of emerging digital technologies,  \n \nRecognizing that the improper or malicious design, development, deployment \nand use of artificial intelligence systems, such as without adequate safeguards or in a \nmanner inconsistent with international law, pose risks that could hinder progress \ntowards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 26 and its \nSustainable Development Goals and undermine sustainable development in its three \ndimensions \u2013 economic, social and environmental; widen digital divides between and \nwithin countries; reinforce structural inequalities and biases; lead to discrimination; \nundermine information integrity and access to information; and undercut the \nprotection, promotion and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, \nincluding the right not to be subject to unlawful or arbitrary interference with one\u2019s \nprivacy, \n__________________ \n \n26 Resolution 70/1. \n\nA/RES/79/175 \nThe right to privacy in the digital age\n \n24-24216\n6/12 \n \n \nNoting with concern that certain predictive algorithms are likely to result in \ndiscrimination, including when non-representative data are used, \n \nNoting that the use of algorithmic or automated decision-making processes \nonline can affect the enjoyment of individuals\u2019 rights offline, \n \nNoting also that the use of data extraction and algorithms to target content \ntowards online users may undermine information integrity, user agency and access to \ninformation online, as well as the right to privacy, which can result in intensifying \nthreats from misinformation, disinformation and hate speech, and may lead to \nviolence, including political violence, and recalling in this regard the Rabat Plan of \nAction on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that \nconstitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence,27 \n \nNoting with concern reports indicating lower accuracy of facial recognition \ntechnologies with certain groups, including when non-representative training data are \nused, that the use of digital technologies can exacerbate racial inequality and in this \ncontext the importance of effective remedies, \n \nEmphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of \ncommunications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, \nhacking and the unlawful use of biometric technologies, as highly intrusive acts, \nviolate the right to privacy, can interfere with the right to freedom of expression and \nto hold opinions without interference, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and \nassociation and the right to freedom of religion or belief and may contradict the tenets \nof a democratic society, including when undertaken extraterritorially or on a mass \nscale, \n \nRecognizing that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected \nonline, including the right to privacy,  \n \nNoting that the accelerated synchronization of online and offline spaces can \naffect individuals\u2019 enjoyment of their human rights, including their right to privacy, \n \nNoting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be \nconsistent with international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the \nbasis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, \ncomprehensive and non-discriminatory, and that any interference with the right to \nprivacy must not be arbitrary or unlawful, bearing in mind what is reasonable with \nregard to the pursuance of legitimate aims, and recalling that States that are parties to \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must take the necessary steps \nto adopt laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights \nrecognized in the Covenant, \n \nExpressing concern about the spread of disinformation and misinformation, \nparticularly on social media platforms, which can be designed and implemented so as \nto mislead, to spread racism, xenophobia, negative stereotyping and stigmatization, \nto violate and abuse human rights, including the right to privacy, to impede freedom \nof expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, and to \nincite all forms of violence, hatred, intolerance, discrimination and hostility, and \nemphasizing the important contribution of journalists, civil society and academia in \ncountering this trend, \n \nNoting with deep concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations \nengaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, \njournalists and other media workers may frequently face threats and harassment and \n__________________ \n \n27 A/HRC/22/17/Add.4, appendix. \n\nThe right to privacy in the digital age \nA/RES/79/175\n \n7/12\n24-24216 \n \nsuffer insecurity, as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their right to \nprivacy, as a result of their activities, \n \nNoting with deep concern also the use of technological tools developed by the \nprivate surveillance industry and by private or public actors to undertake surveillance, \nhacking of devices and systems, interception and disruption of communications, and \ndata collection, interfering with the professional and private lives of individuals, \nincluding those engaged in the promotion and defence of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, journalists and other media workers, in violation or abuse of \ntheir human rights, specifically the right to privacy, \n \nEmphasizing that States must respect international human rights obligations \nregarding the right to privacy when they intercept digital communications of \nindividuals and/or collect personal data, when they share or otherwise provide access \nto data collected through, inter alia, information- and intelligence-sharing agreements \nand when they require disclosure of personal data from third parties, including \nbusiness enterprises, \n \nNoting the increase in the collection of sensitive biometric information from \nindividuals, and stressing that States must comply with their human rights obligations \nand that business enterprises should respect the right to privacy and other human \nrights when collecting, processing, sharing and storing biometric information by, inter \nalia, adopting data protection policies and safeguards,  \n \nDeeply concerned at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception \nof communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of \ncommunications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried \nout on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights, \n \nEmphasizing that, in the digital age, technical solutions to secure and to protect \nthe confidentiality of digital communications and transactions, including measures \nfor strong encryption, pseudonymization and anonymity, are important to ensure the \nenjoyment of human rights, in particular the rights to privacy, to freedom of opinion \nand expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and recognizing \nthat States should promote such measures and refrain from employing unlawful or \narbitrary surveillance techniques, which may include forms of hacking,  \n \nNoting that, while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and \nprotection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with \ntheir obligations under international human rights law,  \n \nNoting also, in that respect, that the prevention and suppression of terrorism is \na public interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that \nany measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations \nunder international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and \nhumanitarian law,  \n \nRecognizing that a lack of access to affordable and reliable technologies and \nservices remains a critical challenge in many developing countries, \n \nStressing the need to address prevailing challenges to bridge the digital divides, \nboth between and within countries, and the gender digital divide, and to harness \ninformation and communications technologies for development, and recalling the need \nto emphasize quality of access to bridge digital and knowledge divides, using a \nmultidimensional approach that includes speed, stability, affordability, language, \ntraining, capacity-building, local content and accessibility for persons with \ndisabilities, and to promote the full enjoyment of human rights, including the right to \nprivacy,  \n\nA/RES/79/175 \nThe right to privacy in the digital age\n \n24-24216\n8/12 \n \n \nStressing also the need to ensure that national security and public health \nmeasures, including the use of technology to monitor and contain the spread of \ninfectious diseases, are in full compliance with the obligations of States under \ninternational human rights law and adhere to the principles of lawfulness, legality, \nlegitimacy with regard to the aim pursued, necessity and proportionality and the need \nto protect human rights, including the right to privacy, and personal data in the \nresponse to health or other emergencies,  \n \nNoting the importance of protecting and respecting the right of individuals to \nprivacy when designing, developing or deploying technological means in response to \ndisasters, epidemics and pandemics, and recalling in this regard the importance of \nprotecting health-related and other personal data, noting also that new emerging \ndigital technologies can contribute to the recovery from global health emergencies, \n \n1. \nReaffirms the right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected \nto arbitrary or
