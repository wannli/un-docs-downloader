small island developing States remain a special case for \nsustainable development, renewing thus our solidarity with them, as they continue to \nface the combined challenges arising, in particular, from their geographical \nremoteness, the small scale of their economies, high costs and the adverse effects of \nclimate change and natural disasters, and remaining particularly concerned that many \nsmall island developing States have not achieved sustained high levels of economic \ngrowth, owing in part to their vulnerabilities to the ongoing negative impacts of \nenvironmental challenges and external economic and financial shocks,  \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety \nand well-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as \nthe severe disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives \nand livelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the \npandemic,

that COVID-19 recovery and return to economic growth in \nsmall island developing States has been constrained by multiple factors, including the \nincreased pressure on food, water, energy and finance, high inflation, rising global \ninterest rates, tightened financial conditions, high indebtedness, disruptions in supply \nchains, and geopolitical tensions and global conflicts, together with the adverse \nimpacts of climate change, biodiversity loss and the digital divide, posing severe \nconsequences for the sustainable development of small island developing States, and \nhighlighting that achieving the Goals and targets set out in the 2030 Agenda will be \nmore difficult and that integrating the concept of resilience is critical to enable a \nsustainable future and avoid creating new risks,  \n \nNoting with grave concern that, although it fell in 2022, the debt level in small \nisland developing States remains above pre-pandemic levels, and more than 40 per \ncent of those States are suffering from severe debt problems, owing to the continuing \nrise of the external debt stock of those States, which grew by 5 per cent in 2022 to \n68.6 billion United States dollars, and by 16 per cent since the end of 2019; moreover, \nthe reduction in liquidity buffers as measured by the ratio of reserves to short-term \ndebt to 148 per cent disproportionately affects small island developing States,  \n \nAcknowledging the need for urgent action to address the adverse impacts of \nclimate change, including those related to sea level rise and extreme weather events, \nwhich continue to pose a significant risk to small island developing States and to their \nefforts to achieve sustainable development and, for many, represent the gravest of \nthreats to
