\npost-disaster response, while ensuring governance frameworks that promote the \nethical, inclusive and equitable use of data and technology and prevent the creation \nof new risks, and recognizes in this regard the need for sustainable and predictable \ninvestment in disaster risk reduction in all sectors;  \n \n7. \nEmphasizes the importance of advancing the digitalization of multi-hazard \nearly warning systems, inter alia, through the enhanced use of information and \ncommunications technologies, in order to ensure the timely, accessible and inclusive \ncommunication of risk

to higher debt \nservicing for developing countries and constrain their growth and their capacity to \ninvest in long-term resilience-building, and acknowledges that, with each new \ndisaster, financial vulnerabilities may grow and domestic response capacities may \nweaken, and in that regard welcomes the development of climate-resilient debt \nclauses, where appropriate, and the exploration of clauses that consider other \ncatastrophic external shocks; \n \n10. Further recognizes the need for the global community, including \ninternational financial institutions, development banks and the private sector, to better \nintegrate inclusive disaster risk reduction into decision-making, with more transparent \naccounting of exposure and management of disaster-related risks, and enhance efforts \nto scale up disaster risk reduction financing instruments to meet the scale of financing \nneeded by developing countries to prevent and reduce risks and build resilience \nagainst current and future shocks and hazards; \n \n11. \nCalls upon all relevant actors to work towards the achievement of the \nglobal targets adopted in the Sendai Framework;  \n\nDisaster risk reduction \nA/RES/80/137\n \n9/20\n25-20759 \n \n \n12.
