economic development;  \n \n5. \nReiterates the need for further efforts to address excessive commodity \nprice volatility, in particular by assisting producers, especially small-scale producers, \nincluding women, in accordance with national plans and policies, in managing risk;  \n \n6. \nStresses that developing countries, including African countries, the least \ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing \nStates, face particular challenges as lower prices for the commodities that they \nproduce threaten the sustainable growth and the debt positions of such countries, and \ntherefore notes that, in this context, economic and export diversification, value \naddition and industrialization can contribute to strengthening resilience to excessive \nprice volatility by allowing the derivation of revenue from various sources;  \n \n7. \nRecognizes the need to continue efforts to diversify economies, as well as \nto improve the regulation, where appropriate, and the efficiency, responsiveness, \nfunctioning and transparency of financial and commodity markets nationally, \nregionally and internationally;  \n \n8.

industrialization in order to achieve \nthe Sustainable Development Goals;  \n \n9. \nRecognizes the relationship between technological change, innovation, \neconomic diversification and structural transformation, notes with concern that most \ncommodity-dependent developing countries have made minimal gains in closing \ntechnological gaps in the past 25 years, and notes that acquiring technological \ncapabilities on mutually agreed terms and adopting policies and exploring the creation \nof national institutions, as appropriate, that foster innovation and technological \ndevelopment in line with the Sustainable Development Goals could help to close those \ngaps;  \n \n10. Encourages Member States, development partners and the private sector \nto promote economic diversification in commodity-dependent developing countries \nby means of responsible and sustainable investments in productive capacity, physical \ncapital accumulation, value addition to commodities supply chains, human capacity-\nbuilding, infrastructure, the improvement of science and technology capabilities and \nthe strengthening of institutions and governance, in line with the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, while considering that diversification strategies can contribute \nto the creation of decent work and economic growth (Goal 8) and build resilient \ninfrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation (Goal 9);  \n\nCommodities \nA/RES/78/138\n \n7/10\n23-25929 \n \n \n11. \nCalls upon the international community to support the efforts of and foster \ncooperation with commodity-dependent developing countries to address the factors \nthat create structural barriers to international trade and impede, inter alia, \ndiversification, including tariff and non-tariff barriers, limited access to financial \nservices resulting in scarce resources for investing in the commodity sector, weak \ninfrastructure, particularly regarding both the cost and availability of transportation \nand storage, and lack of skills in producing and marketing alternative products;  \n \n12. Emphasizes the importance of enhanced collaboration between the public \nand private sectors and high levels of investment in commodity-dependent developing \ncountries to promote diversification and upgrade productive structures integrated into \nglobal value chains for sustainable development;  \n \n13. Also emphasizes the importance of coherence in the integration of \ndeveloping countries into commodity value chains, particularly through local and \nregional value addition;  \n \n14.

Calls for a coherent set of policy actions at the national, regional and \ninternational levels to address excessive price volatility and support commodity-\ndependent developing countries in mitigating negative impacts, by facilitating value \naddition and enhancing their participation in commodity and related product value \nchains, by supporting large-scale diversification of these economies and by \nencouraging the use and further development of market-oriented risk management \ntools, instruments and strategies;  \n \n17. Stresses the importance of developing and strengthening agricultural \npolicies and strategies that recognize and address women\u2019s critical role in food security \nand improved nutrition outcomes as an integral part of both short- and long-term \nresponses to food insecurity and malnutrition and food crises in developing countries;  \n \n18. Recognizes the potential for innovation, productivity improvements and \nthe promotion of non-traditional exports in most commodity-dependent developing \ncountries, particularly in Africa, and calls for enhanced support by the international \ncommunity as well as exchanges of experience in these areas within the framework \nof South-South economic cooperation;  \n \n19. Underscores the importance of increased investments in quality, reliable, \nsustainable and resilient infrastructure as a means of promoting sustainable \nagricultural development and enhancing commodity diversification, including value-\nadded production, and trade, and urges the international community to assist \ncommodity-dependent developing countries in mainstreaming trade as well as sound \ninvestment and financial policies as key elements of development strategies, based \non national circumstances and development priorities, and investing in and supporting \nresearch, innovation and development of sustainable agriculture productivity;  \n__________________ \n \n15  Resolution 70/1. \n\nA/RES/78/138 \nCommodities\n \n23-25929\n8/10 \n \n \n20. Stresses that technical assistance and capacity-building aimed at improving \nthe commodity export competitiveness of producers are particularly important for \ndeveloping countries, especially in Africa, and invites Member States and all relevant \nstakeholders to provide the resources necessary for commodity-specific financial and \ntechnical assistance, in particular for human and institutional capacity-building, \nincluding gender-responsive measures, as well as quality, reliable, sustainable and \nresilient infrastructure development of developing countries, with a view to reducing \ntheir institutional bottlenecks and transaction costs and enhancing their commodity \ntrade and development in accordance with national development plans; \n \n21. Also stresses that the Aid for Trade initiative should aim to help developing \ncountries, particularly the least developed countries, to build the supply-side capacity \nand trade-related infrastructure that they need to assist them in implementing and \nbenefiting from World Trade Organization agreements and, more broadly, expanding \ntheir trade; \n \n22. Recalls the agreement to keep under regular review, by the Ministerial \nConference and appropriate bodies of the World Trade Organization, the impact of \nthe results of the Uruguay Round on the least developed countries as well as on the \nnet food-importing developing countries, with a view to fostering positive measures \nto enable them to achieve their development objectives, and in this regard looks \nforward to the implementation of the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures \nConcerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least \nDeveloped and Net Food-Importing Developing Countries;  \n \n23. Recognizes that high volatility in food prices in various countries and \ncontinuing food insecurity and malnutrition being faced by hundreds of millions of \npeople, in particular in Africa, in South and West Asia and in parts of Latin America \nand the Caribbean, highlight the need for resilient and diversified agrifood systems, \nin order to lower the risks associated with future shocks and to safeguard access to \nsafe, sufficient and nutritious food and diversified healthy diets, by supporting large-\nscale diversification of these economies, building a stronger food production sector \ninclusive of all relevant stakeholders, boosting productivity and market links in the \nfood supply chains, increasing investments for a more diverse agricultural sector and \nseeking partnerships to increase trade and strengthen supply chains;  \n \n24. Stresses that improving access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food and \ndiversified healthy diets and maintaining food security during crises involve efforts \nto protect the most vulnerable, which, drawing from the experiences of the COVID-19 \npandemic, highlights the need for socioeconomic policies to counteract the effects of \nadverse economic cycles and serve as a buffer against income shocks;  \n \n25. Encourages developed countries that have not already done so and \ndeveloping countries declaring themselves in a position to do so to take steps towards \nthe goal of realizing timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access \non a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with the Hong Kong \nMinisterial Declaration adopted by the World Trade Organization in 2005;  \n \n26. Notes the efforts under way to make the international financial architecture \nmore responsive to global challenges, recognizes that more needs to be done, and in \nthis regard strongly encourages international financial institutions and development \nbanks to assist developing countries, in particular commodity-dependent developing \ncountries, in managing the effects of commodity price volatility, including excessive \nvolatility, in accordance with their respective mandates; \n \n27.
