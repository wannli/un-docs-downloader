\n \n3. \nEmphasizes that extreme poverty is a major issue to be addressed by \nGovernments, the United Nations system and international financial institutions, the \nprivate sector, including the corporate sector, civil society and community-based \nsocial organizations, and in this context reaffirms that political commitment is a \nprerequisite for the eradication of poverty;
