irreplaceable part \nof the natural systems of the Earth which must be protected for this generation and \nthe generations to come, \n \nSeriously concerned about the rate of species extinctions, as indicated in the \nfindings of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and \nEcosystem Services, 1 and stressing the urgent need to address the unprecedented \nglobal decline in
