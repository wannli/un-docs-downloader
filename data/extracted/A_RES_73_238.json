sites \nof Maili-Say, Min-Kush and Shekaftar, Kyrgyzstan, Degmay and Taboshar, \nTajikistan, and Chorkesar and Yangiobod, Uzbekistan, as well as promising \nremediation projects for these sites planned to be implemented and financed within \nthe framework of the Environmental Remediation Account for Central Asia managed \nby the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and noting the holding \nof a donors\u2019 conference in this connection in London on 8 November 2018, \n \nNoting the importance of the Strategic Master Plan for environmental \nremediation at the sites of former uranium facilities in Central Asia, developed by the \nCoordination Group for Uranium Legacy Sites of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency and approved by the competent authorities of the Governments of \nKyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in 2017,1  \n \nNoting also that numerous burial sites of uranium waste and other extremely \nhazardous radioactive processing wastes are located in densely populated areas of the \nCentral Asian countries,  \n \nNoting further that many tailings ponds are located in seismically active areas \nclose to population centres and the banks of major rivers in the region and are subject \nto the threat of natural disasters,  \n \nReaffirming the human rights to life, to an adequate standard of living and to \nthe enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and \nstressing in this regard the need to mitigate the impact of natural and man-made \ndisasters in the areas around uranium waste burial sites and tailings ponds in order to \navoid loss of human life, as well as immediate and long-term negative consequences \nfor human health,  \n \nNoting the need to inform the public in a timely manner when conducting work \non the prevention of the radiation threat in Central Asia,  \n \nConsidering that, despite the efforts made by the States of Central Asia at the \nnational level and despite the support of international programmes and projects to \nremediate former uranium mines and tailings ponds, a number of States continue to \nhave serious social, economic and environmental problems associated with former \nuranium mines and tailings ponds,  \n \nStriving to contribute to strengthening the security and safety of radioactive \nmaterials,  \n \nExpressing gratitude to donor countries, in particular Czechia, Finland, \nGermany, Japan, Norway, the Russian Federation, Switzerland and the United States \nof America, and to international and regional organizations and financial institutions, \nincluding the United Nations Development Programme, the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the \nEuropean Union,
