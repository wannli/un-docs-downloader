sustainable development; \n \n6. \nRecognizes the need for developing countries rich in critical minerals to \npromote domestic processing of these minerals in a way that adds value to the

Reiterates the need for further efforts to address excessive commodity \nprice volatility, in particular by assisting producers, especially small-scale producers, \nincluding women, in accordance with national plans and policies, in managing risk; \n \n11. Stresses that developing countries, including African countries, the least \ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing \nStates, face particular challenges, such as long-term declines in certain commodities, \nand that the fluctuating prices for the commodities that they produce and export \nthreaten the sustainable growth and the debt positions of such countries during \nperiodic price downturns, and therefore notes that, in this context, economic and \nexport diversification, value addition and industrialization can contribute to \nstrengthening resilience to excessive price volatility by allowing the derivation of \nrevenue from various sources; \n \n12. Recognizes the need to continue efforts to diversify economies, as well as \nto improve the regulation, where appropriate, and the efficiency, responsiveness, \nfunctioning and transparency of financial and commodity markets nationally, \nregionally and internationally; \n \n13.

Calls for a coherent set of policy actions at the national, regional and \ninternational levels to address excessive price volatility and support commodity-\ndependent developing countries in mitigating negative impacts, by facilitating value \naddition and enhancing their participation in commodity and related product value \nchains, by supporting large-scale diversification of these economies and by \nencouraging the use and further development of market-oriented risk management \ntools, instruments and strategies; \n_______________ \n \n13 Resolution 70/1. \n\nA/RES/80/124 \nCommodities\n \n25-20760\n8/10 \n \n \n24.

Stresses that technical assistance and capacity-building aimed at \nimproving the commodity export competitiveness of producers are particularly \nimportant for developing countries, especially in Africa, and invites Member States \nand all relevant stakeholders to provide the resources necessary for commodity-\nspecific financial and technical assistance, in particular for human and institutional \ncapacity-building, including gender-responsive measures, as well as quality, reliable, \nsustainable and resilient infrastructure development of developing countries, with a \nview to reducing their institutional bottlenecks and transaction costs and enhancing \ntheir commodity trade and development in accordance with national development \nplans; \n \n28.

Recognizes that high volatility in food prices in various countries and \ncontinuing food insecurity and malnutrition being faced by hundreds of millions of \npeople, in particular in Africa, in South and West Asia and in parts of Latin America \nand the Caribbean, highlight the need for resilient and diversified agrifood systems, \nin order to lower the risks associated with future shocks and to safeguard access to \nsafe, sufficient and nutritious food and diversified healthy diets, by supporting large-\nscale diversification of these economies, building a stronger food production sector \ninclusive of all relevant stakeholders, boosting productivity and market links in the \nfood supply chains, increasing investments for a more diverse agricultural sector and \nseeking partnerships to increase trade and strengthen supply chains; \n\nCommodities \nA/RES/80/124\n \n9/10\n25-20760 \n \n \n31. Stresses that improving access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food and \ndiversified healthy diets and maintaining food security during crises involve efforts \nto protect the most vulnerable, which, drawing from the experiences of the COVID\u201119 \npandemic, highlights the need for socioeconomic policies to counteract the effects of \nadverse economic cycles and serve as a buffer against income shocks; \n \n32. Encourages developed countries that have not already done so and \ndeveloping countries declaring themselves in a position to do so to take steps towards \nthe goal of realizing timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access \non a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with the Hong Kong \nMinisterial Declaration adopted by the World Trade Organization in 2005; \n \n33.

Stresses that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \nand its partners, in the spirit of inter-agency cooperation and multi-stakeholder \npartnerships, within their respective mandates, should continue to engage actively in \ncollaborative research and analysis of the commodity problematique and related \ncapacity- and consensus-building activities, with a view to providing regular analysis \nand policy advice relevant to the sustainable development of commodity-dependent \ndeveloping countries, particularly low-income countries; \n \n39.
