from the spread of COVID-19 \nand due to extreme weather events and that the COVID-19 pandemic has had \nwidespread impacts on agricultural production systems, including those producing \nnatural plant fibres, as it has disrupted natural plant fibre production and value chains \nowing to restrictions in the movement and availability of inputs, labour, post-harvest \nservices and timely access to markets, and has challenged the livelihoods of farmers, \nincluding small-scale and family farmers and workers dependent on agriculture, \nincluding migrant workers,  \n \n1. \nInvites all relevant

\nRecognizes that the production, processing, application and proper \nmanagement and export of natural plant fibres may well have the potential to be \nadvantageous to the economies of many developing countries and the livelihoods of \nmillions of small-scale farmers and low-wage workers, and in this regard calls upon \nMember States to take effective measures, as appropriate, to help to integrate small-\nscale holders into global production, value and supply chains for the sustainable \nproduction, consumption and use of natural plant fibres;  \n \n4. \nStresses that the sustainable production, consumption and use of natural \nplant fibres may contribute to broader efforts towards the implementation of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development, as well as of outcome documents of other related \nmajor United Nations conferences and summits and multilateral environmental \nagreements including the Paris Agreement, and the achievement of the Kunming-\nMontreal Global
