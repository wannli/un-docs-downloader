advance the effective protection and \npromotion of the rights of the child and the elimination of violence against children, \nand in this regard taking note, inter alia, of the Global Partnership to

poverty, social inequality, inadequate social and economic conditions, \npandemics, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria, cholera and tuberculosis, fetal alcohol \nsyndrome and inherited addictions, non-communicable diseases, lack of access to safe \ndrinking water and sanitation, environmental damage, climate change, natural \ndisasters, armed conflict, foreign occupation, displacement, famine,

and \nan indispensable requirement for sustainable development, recognizing its impact \nbeyond the socioeconomic context and the intrinsic interlinkage between poverty \neradication and the promotion of sustainable development, in this regard underlining \nthe importance of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment, and recognizing that a strong focus is needed on poverty, deprivation \nand inequality to prevent and protect children from all forms of violence and to \npromote the resilience of children, their families and their communities,  \n \nProfoundly concerned further that children in many parts of the world remain \nnegatively affected by the impacts of climate change, including persistent drought \nand extreme weather events, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and \nocean acidification, which further threaten health, food security and efforts to \neradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and in this regard

\nExpressing deep concern that, despite the recognition of the right of the child to \nexpress her or his views freely on all matters affecting her or him, with her or his \nviews given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, children \nare still seldom seriously consulted and involved in such matters owing to a variety \nof constraints and impediments and that the full implementation of this right has yet \nto be fully realized,  \n \nDeeply concerned that children disproportionately suffer the consequences of \ndiscrimination, exclusion, inequality and poverty,  \n \nDeeply concerned also that approximately 5.6 million children under the age of \n5 die each year,37 mostly from preventable and treatable causes, owing to inadequate \nor lack of access to integrated and quality sexual, reproductive and maternal health-\ncare services, as well as newborn and child health care and services, early \nchildbearing and lack of access to health determinants, such as safe drinking water \nand sanitation, safe and adequate food and nutrition, including breastfeeding, and that \nmortality remains highest among children belonging to the poorest and most \nmarginalized communities,  \n \nRecognizing that the risk of maternal mortality is highest for girls under 15 years \nof age and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death \namong girls under 15 years of age in many countries,  \n \nExpressing concern that children with disabilities face stigmatization, \ndiscrimination or exclusion and are disproportionately subjected to mental and \nphysical violence and sexual abuse in all settings,  \n \nI \nImplementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the \nOptional Protocols thereto \n \n \n1.
