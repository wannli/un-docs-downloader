December 2015, 71/45 of 5 December 2016, 72/54 \nof 4 December 2017, 73/54 of 5 December 2018, 74/62 of 12 December 2019, 75/62 \nof 7 December 2020, 76/47 of 6 December 2021, 77/79 of 7 December 2022 and 78/32 \nof 4 December 2023 on the implementation of the Convention, \n \nReaffirming its determination to put an end for all time to the suffering and \ncasualties caused by cluster munitions at the time of their use, when they fail to \nfunction as intended or when they are abandoned, \n \nDeploring the use of cluster munitions in recent and ongoing conflicts and the \nrelated significant increase in civilian casualties, and calling upon those who continue \nto use cluster munitions to cease any such activity immediately, \n \nConscious that cluster munition remnants kill or maim civilians, including \nwomen and children, obstruct economic and social development, including through \nthe loss of livelihood, impede post-conflict reconciliation, rehabilitation and \nreconstruction, delay or prevent the return of refugees and internally displaced \npersons, can have a negative impact on national and international peacebuilding and \nhumanitarian assistance efforts, and have other severe consequences for many years \nafter use, \n \nConcerned about the dangers presented by the large national stockpiles of \ncluster munitions retained and also transferred for operational use, and determined to \nensure their rapid destruction, \n\nA/RES/79/58 \nImplementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions\n \n24-23085\n2/4 \n \n \nWelcoming the important achievement of the completion by all States parties to \nthe Convention of their article 3 obligations, after the destruction by South Africa and \nPeru of their respective stockpiles of cluster munitions, \n \nRecognizing the impact of cluster munitions on women, men, girls and boys and \nthe importance of relevant States providing adequate, gender- and age-sensitive \nassistance to victims of cluster munitions, \n \nBelieving it necessary to contribute effectively in an efficient, coordinated \nmanner to resolving the challenge of removing cluster munition remnants located \nthroughout the world, and to ensure their destruction, \n \nMindful of the need to adequately coordinate efforts undertaken in various \nforums, including through the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 1 \nto address the rights and adequately provide for the needs of victims of various types \nof weapons, and resolved to avoid discrimination among victims of various types of \nweapons, \n \nReaffirming that in cases not covered by the Convention on Cluster Munitions 2 \nor by other international agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the \nprotection and authority of the principles of international law, derived from \nestablished custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public \nconscience, \n \nWelcoming the steps taken nationally, regionally and globally in recent years \naimed at prohibiting, restricting or suspending the use, stockpiling, production and \ntransfer of cluster munitions, and welcoming also in this regard that, since 2014, all \nCentral American States have joined the Convention, thus fulfilling their aspiration \nto become the first cluster munitions-free region in the world, \n \nStressing the role of public conscience in furthering the principles of humanity, \nas evidenced by the global call for an end to civilian suffering caused by cluster \nmunitions, and recognizing the efforts to that end undertaken by the United Nations, \nthe International Committee of the Red Cross, the Cluster Munition Coalition and \nnumerous other non-governmental organizations around the world, \n \nNoting that a total of 124 States have joined the Convention, 112 as States \nparties and 12 as signatories, albeit taking note that the twelfth Meeting of States \nParties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions deeply regretted the recent decision \nof Lithuania,3 exercising its national sovereignty, to withdraw from the Convention \npursuant to its article 20, \n \nEmphasizing the need to make further efforts in accelerating the universalization \nprocess, and acknowledging the call by States parties and other stakeholders, as a \nmatter of priority, to all States that have not yet done so, to ratify or otherwise accede \nto the Convention and, in particular in the current context, to prevent any withdrawal, \nto promote universal adherence to and strict observance of the Convention\u2019s norms, \nincluding to discourage, in every possible way, the use, development, production, \nstockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions, \n \nNoting the outcome of the second Review Conference of States Parties to the \nConvention on Cluster Munitions, held in Geneva from 25 to 27 November 2020 and \non 20 and 21 September 2021, and in particular the adoption of the Lausanne \nDeclaration
