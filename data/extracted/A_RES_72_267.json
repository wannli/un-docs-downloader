The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link between \nthe illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict \nas a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly,  \n \nRecognizing that the trade in conflict diamonds continues to be a matter of \nserious international concern, which can be directly linked to the fuelling of armed \nconflict, the activities of rebel movements aimed at undermining or overthrowing \nlegitimate Governments and the illicit traffic in and proliferation of armaments, \nespecially small arms and light weapons,  \n \nRecognizing also the devastating impact of conflicts fuelled by the trade in \nconflict diamonds on the peace, safety and security of people in affected countries, \nand the systematic and gross human rights violations that have been perpetrated in \nsuch conflicts,  \n \nNoting the negative impact of such conflicts on regional stability and the \nobligations placed upon States by the Charter of the United Nations regarding the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, and recognizing that continued \naction to curb the trade in conflict diamonds is imperative,  \n \nNoting with appreciation that the Kimberley Process, as an international \ninitiative led by Participants, has pursued its deliberations on an inclusive basis \ninvolving concerned stakeholders, including producing, exporting and importing \nStates, the diamond industry and civil society, as well as applicant States and \ninternational organizations,  \n \nNoting that the vast majority of rough diamonds produced in the world are from \nlegitimate sources, recalling that the elimination of conflict diamonds from legitimate \ntrade is the primary objective of the Kimberley Process, and stressing the need to \ncontinue its activities in order to achieve this objective, \n\nA/RES/72/267 \nThe role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link between the illicit \ntransaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a contribution\nto prevention and settlement of conflicts\n \n18-03560 \n2/4 \n \n \nWelcoming the important contribution of the Kimberley Process, which was \ninitiated by African diamond-producing countries, and calling for the consistent \nimplementation of commitments made by Kimberley Process Participants and the \ndiamond industry and civil society organizations, as observers,  \n \nAcknowledging the successful role that the Kimberley Process has played, in the \nlast 15 years, in stemming the flow of conflict diamonds and the valuable \ndevelopment impact it has had in improving the lives of most people dependent on \nthe trade in diamonds,  \n \nAcknowledging also that the diamond sector is an important catalyst for \npromoting economic and social development, which are necessary for poverty \nreduction and meeting the requirements of the Sustainable Development Goals in \nmany producing countries, particularly in developing countries,  \n \nRecalling its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled \u201cTransforming our \nworld: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d, in which it adopted a \ncomprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative \nSustainable Development Goals and targets, committed itself to working tirelessly for \nthe full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, recognized that eradicating poverty \nin all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global \nchallenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, and \nexpressed its commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three \ndimensions \u2013 economic, social and environmental \u2013 in a balanced and integrated \nmanner and to building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals \nand seeking to address their unfinished business,  \n \nRecalling also the positive benefits of the legitimate diamond trade to producing \ncountries and its critical contribution to the economies of the producing, exporting \nand importing States, and underlining the need for continued international action to \nprevent the problem of conflict diamonds from negatively affecting the trade in \nlegitimate diamonds,  \n \nRecalling further the Charter and all the relevant resolutions of the Security \nCouncil related to conflict diamonds, and determined to contribute to and support the \nimplementation of the measures provided for in those resolutions,  \n \nRecalling Security Council resolution 1459 (2003) of 28 January 2003, in which \nthe Council strongly supported the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme 1 as a \nvaluable contribution against trafficking in conflict diamonds,  \n \nNoting with satisfaction that the implementation of the Kimberley Process \nCertification Scheme continues to have a positive impact in reducing the opportunity \nfor conflict diamonds to play a role in fuelling armed conflict and helps to protect \nlegitimate trade and ensure the effective implementation of the relevant resolutions \non trade in conflict diamonds,  \n \nAcknowledging that lessons learned from the Kimberley Process may be useful \nfor the work of the Peacebuilding Commission in its consideration of the countries \nincluded in its agenda, as appropriate,  \n \nRecognizing that regular review and reform of the Kimberley Process will be \nnecessary to keep pace with and aim to address the ongoing threat of instability, \nconflict and contemporary challenges in the diamond trade, as well as to seize \ncontemporary opportunities, \n_______________ \n1 See A/57/489. \n\nThe role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link between the illicit \ntransaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a contribution \nto prevention and settlement of conflicts \nA/RES/72/267\n \n3/4 \n18-03560 \n \n \nWelcoming the implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme \nin such a way as not to impede the legitimate trade in diamonds or impose an undue \nburden on Governments or industry, particularly smaller producers, nor to hinder the \ndevelopment of the diamond industry,  \n \nWelcoming also the decision of the 54 Kimberley Process Participants, \nrepresenting 81 countries, including the 28 States members of the European Union \nrepresented by the European Commission, to address the problem of conflict \ndiamonds by participating in the Kimberley Process and implementing the Kimberley \nProcess Certification Scheme,  \n \nWelcoming further the demonstration by Gabon of its determination to become \na Kimberley Process Participant and its having met the main requirements, \n \nNoting the decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization of \n11 December 2012 granting an extension until 31 December 2018 of a waiver with \nrespect to the measures taken to implement the Kimberley Process Certification \nScheme, \n \nRecognizing that State sovereignty should be fully respected and that the \nprinciples of equality, mutual benefits and consensus should be adhered to,  \n \nRecognizing also that the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which came \ninto effect on 1 January 2003, will be credible only if all Participants have the \nrequisite national legislation coupled with effective and credible internal systems of \ncontrol designed to eliminate the presence of conflict diamonds in the chain of \nproducing, exporting and importing rough diamonds within their own territories and \nacross their borders, while taking into account that differences in production methods \nand trading practices, as well as differences in the institutional controls thereof, may \nrequire different approaches to meeting minimum standards, encouraging all \nParticipants to exceed them and to work towards overall compliance with the \nKimberley Process standards,  \n \nRecalling its resolution 71/277 of 2 February 2017 and its previous
