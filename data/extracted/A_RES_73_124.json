loss of life and adverse impact on \ninternational trade, energy security and the global economy resulting from such \nactivities, \n \nReiterating the importance of the fair treatment of crew members and its \ninfluence on maritime safety,  \n \nRecognizing that fibre-optic submarine cables transmit most of the world\u2019s data \nand communications and hence are vitally important to the global economy and the \nnational security of all States, conscious that these cables are susceptible to \nintentional and accidental damage from shipping and other activities and that the \nmaintenance, including the repair, of these cables is important, noting that these \nmatters have been brought to the attention of States at various workshops and \nseminars, and conscious of the need for States to adopt national laws and regulations \nto protect submarine cables and render their wilful damage or damage by culpable \nnegligence punishable offences,  \n \nNoting the importance of the
