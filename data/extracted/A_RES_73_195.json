We \nrecall the advances made through the United Nations High-level Dialogues on \nInternational Migration and Development in 2006 and 2013. We also acknowledge \nthe contributions of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, launched in \n2007. These platforms paved the way for the New York Declaration for Refugees and \nMigrants, through which we committed to elaborate a global compact on refugees and \nto adopt this Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, in two \nseparate processes. The two global compacts, together, present complementary \ninternational cooperation frameworks that fulfil their respective mandates as laid out \n__________________ \n \n2 Resolution 217 A (III). \n \n3 See resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex. \n \n4  International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Convention \non the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Convention against Torture \nand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Convention on the Rights of \nthe Child, International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and \nMembers of Their Families, International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from \nEnforced Disappearance, and Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. \n \n5 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2225, No. 39574. \n \n6 Ibid., vol. 2237, No. 39574. \n \n7 Ibid., vol. 2241, No. 39574. \n \n8 League of Nations, Treaty Series, vol.

Only refugees are entitled to the specific international protection defined \nby international refugee law. This Global Compact refers to migrants and presents a \ncooperative framework addressing migration in all its dimensions.  \n5. \nAs a contribution to the preparatory process for this Global Compact, we \nrecognize the inputs shared by Member States and relevant stakeholders during the \nconsultation and stocktaking phases, as well as the report of the Secretary-General \nentitled \u201cMaking migration work for all\u201d.18 \n6. \nThis Global Compact is a milestone in the history of the global dialogue and \ninternational cooperation on migration. It is rooted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and informed by the Declaration \nof the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, adopted in \nOctober 2013.19 It builds on the pioneering work of the former Special Representative \nof the Secretary-General on Migration, including his report of 3 February 2017.20 \n7. \nThis Global Compact presents a non-legally binding, cooperative framework \nthat builds on the commitments agreed upon by Member States in the New York \nDeclaration for Refugees and Migrants. It fosters international cooperation among all \nrelevant actors on migration, acknowledging that no State can address migration alone, \nand upholds the sovereignty of States and their obligations under international law. \n \n \n \n \nOur vision and guiding principles \n \n \n8. \nThis Global Compact expresses our collective commitment to improving \ncooperation on international migration. Migration has been part of the human \nexperience throughout history, and we recognize that it is a source of prosperity, \ninnovation and sustainable development in our globalized world, and that these \npositive impacts can be optimized by improving migration governance. The majority \nof migrants around the world today travel, live and work in a safe, orderly and regular \nmanner. Nonetheless, migration undeniably affects our countries, communities, \nmigrants and their families in very different and sometimes unpredictable ways.  \n9. \nIt is crucial that the challenges and opportunities of international migration unite \nus, rather than divide us. This Global Compact sets out our common understanding, \nshared responsibilities and unity of purpose regarding migration, making it work \nfor all. \n \n \n \nCommon understanding \n \n10. This Global Compact is the product of an unprecedented review of evidence and \ndata gathered during an open, transparent and inclusive process. We shared our \nrealities and heard diverse voices, enriching and shaping our common understanding \nof this complex phenomenon. We learned that migration is a defining feature of our \nglobalized world, connecting societies within and across all regions, making us all \ncountries of origin, transit and destination. We recognize that there is a continuous \nneed for international efforts to strengthen our knowledge and analysis of migration, \n__________________ \n \n18 A/72/643. \n \n19 Resolution 68/4. \n \n20 See A/71/728. \n\nA/RES/73/195 \nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration\n \n18-22354\n4/36 \n \nas shared understandings will improve policies that unlock the potential of sustainable \ndevelopment for all. We must collect and disseminate quality data. We must ensure \nthat current and potential migrants are fully informed about their rights, obligations \nand options for safe, orderly and regular migration, and are aware of the risks of \nirregular migration. We also must provide all our citizens with access to objective, \nevidence-based, clear information about the benefits and challenges of migration, \nwith a view to dispelling misleading narratives that generate negative perceptions of \nmigrants.  \n \n \n \nShared responsibilities \n \n11. \nThis Global Compact offers a 360-degree vision of international migration and \nrecognizes that a comprehensive approach is needed to optimize the overall benefits \nof migration, while addressing risks and challenges for individuals and communities \nin countries of origin, transit and destination. No country can address the challenges \nand opportunities of this global phenomenon on its own. With this comprehensive \napproach, we aim to facilitate safe, orderly and regular migration, while reducing the \nincidence and negative impact of irregular migration through international \ncooperation and a combination of measures put forward in this Global Compact. We \nacknowledge our shared responsibilities to one another as States Members of the \nUnited Nations to address each other\u2019s needs and concerns over migration, and an \noverarching obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all migrants, \nregardless of their migration status, while promoting the security and prosperity of all \nour communities. \n12. This Global Compact aims to mitigate the adverse drivers and structural factors \nthat hinder people from building and maintaining sustainable livelihoods in their \ncountries of origin, and so compel them to seek a future elsewhere. It intends to reduce \nthe risks and vulnerabilities migrants face at different stages of migration by \nrespecting, protecting and fulfilling their human rights and providing them with care \nand assistance. It seeks to address legitimate concerns of communities, while \nrecognizing that societies are undergoing demographic, economic, social and \nenvironmental changes at different scales that may have implications for and result \nfrom migration. It strives to create conducive conditions that enable all migrants to \nenrich our societies through their human, economic and social capacities, and thus \nfacilitate their contributions to sustainable development at the local, national, regional \nand global levels. \n \n \n \nUnity of purpose \n \n13. This Global Compact recognizes that safe, orderly and regular migration works \nfor all when it takes place in a well-informed, planned and consensual manner. \nMigration should never be an act of desperation. When it is, we must cooperate to \nrespond to the needs of migrants in situations of vulnerability, and address the \nrespective challenges. We must work together to create conditions that allow \ncommunities and individuals to live in safety and dignity in their own countries. We \nmust save lives and keep migrants out of harm\u2019s way. We must empower migrants to \nbecome full members of our societies, highlight their positive contributions, and \npromote inclusion and social cohesion. We must generate greater predictability and \ncertainty for States, communities and migrants alike. To achieve this, we commit to \nfacilitate and ensure safe, orderly and regular migration for the benefit of all. \n14. Our success rests on the mutual trust, determination and solidarity of States to \nfulfil the objectives and commitments contained in this Global Compact. We unite, in \na spirit of win-win cooperation, to address the challenges and opportunities of \nmigration in all its dimensions through shared responsibility and innovative solutions. \nIt is with this sense of common purpose that we take this historic step, fully aware \n\nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration \nA/RES/73/195\n \n5/36\n18-22354 \n \nthat the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is a milestone, but \nnot the end to our efforts. We commit to continue the multilateral dialogue at the \nUnited Nations through a periodic and effective follow-up and review mechanism, \nensuring that the words in this document translate into concrete actions for the benefit \nof millions of people in every region of the world. \n15. We agree that this Global Compact is based on a set of cross-cutting and \ninterdependent guiding principles: \n \n(a) \nPeople-centred. The Global Compact carries a strong human dimension, \ninherent to the migration experience itself. It promotes the well-being of migrants and \nthe members of communities in countries of origin, transit and destination. As a result, \nthe Global Compact places individuals at its core;  \n \n(b) \nInternational cooperation. The Global Compact is a non-legally binding \ncooperative framework that recognizes that no State can address migration on its own \nbecause of the inherently transnational nature of the phenomenon. It requires \ninternational, regional and bilateral cooperation and dialogue. Its authority rests on \nits consensual nature, credibility, collective ownership, joint implementation, \nfollow-up and review;  \n \n(c) \nNational sovereignty. The Global Compact reaffirms the sovereign right \nof States to determine their national migration policy and their prerogative to govern \nmigration within their jurisdiction, in conformity with international law. Within their \nsovereign jurisdiction, States may distinguish between regular and irregular migration \nstatus, including as they determine their legislative and policy measures for the \nimplementation of the Global Compact, taking into account different national \nrealities, policies, priorities and requirements for entry, residence and work, in \naccordance with international law;  \n \n(d) \nRule of law and due process. The Global Compact recognizes that respect \nfor the rule of law, due process and access to justice are fundamental to all aspects of \nmigration governance. This means that the State, public and private institutions and \nentities, as well as persons themselves, are accountable to laws that are publicly \npromulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and are consistent with \ninternational law;  \n \n(e) \nSustainable development. The Global Compact is rooted in the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development, and builds upon its recognition that migration \nis a multidimensional reality of major relevance for the sustainable development of \ncountries of origin, transit and destination, which requires coherent and \ncomprehensive responses. Migration contributes to positive development outcomes \nand to realizing the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially \nwhen it is properly managed. The Global Compact aims to leverage the potential of \nmigration for the achievement of all Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the \nimpact this achievement will have on migration in the future; \n \n(f) \nHuman rights. The Global Compact is based on international human rights \nlaw and upholds the principles of non-regression and non-discrimination. By \nimplementing the Global Compact, we ensure effective respect for and protection and \nfulfilment of the human rights of all migrants, regardless of their migration status, \nacross all stages of the migration cycle. We also reaffirm the commitment to eliminate \nall forms of discrimination, including racism, xenophobia and intolerance, against \nmigrants and their families; \n \n(g) \nGender-responsive. The Global Compact ensures that the human rights of \nwomen, men, girls and boys are respected at all stages of migration, that their specific \nneeds are properly understood and addressed and that they are empowered as agents \nof change. It mainstreams a gender perspective and promotes gender equality and the \n\nA/RES/73/195 \nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration\n \n18-22354\n6/36 \n \nempowerment of all women and girls, recognizing their independence, agency and \nleadership in order to move away from addressing migrant women primarily through \na lens of victimhood; \n \n(h) \nChild-sensitive. The Global Compact promotes existing international legal \nobligations in relation to the rights of the child, and upholds the principle of the best \ninterests of the child at all times, as a primary consideration in all situations concerning \nchildren in the context of international migration, including unaccompanied and \nseparated children; \n \n(i) \nWhole-of-government approach. The Global Compact considers that \nmigration is a multidimensional reality that cannot be addressed by one government \npolicy sector alone. To develop and implement effective migration policies and \npractices, a whole-of-government approach is needed to ensure horizontal and \nvertical policy coherence across all sectors and levels of government; \n \n(j) \nWhole-of-society approach. The Global Compact promotes broad multi-\nstakeholder partnerships to address migration in all its dimensions by including \nmigrants, diasporas, local communities, civil society, academia, the private sector, \nparliamentarians, trade unions, national human rights institutions, the media and other \nrelevant stakeholders in migration governance.  \n \n \n \n \nOur cooperative framework \n \n \n16. With the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, we adopted a \npolitical declaration and a set of commitments. Reaffirming that Declaration in its \nentirety, we build upon it by laying out the following cooperative framework, \ncomprising 23 objectives, implementation, as well as follow-up and review. Each \nobjective contains a commitment, followed by a range of actions considered to be \nrelevant policy instruments and best practices. To fulfil the 23 objectives, we will \ndraw from these actions to achieve safe, orderly and regular migration along the \nmigration cycle. \n \nObjectives for safe, orderly and regular migration \n1. \nCollect and utilize accurate and disaggregated data as a basis for evidence-based \npolicies \n2. \nMinimize the adverse drivers and structural factors that compel people to leave \ntheir country of origin \n3. \nProvide accurate and timely information at all stages of migration \n4. \nEnsure that all migrants have proof of legal identity and adequate documentation\n5. \nEnhance availability and flexibility of pathways for regular migration \n6. \nFacilitate fair and ethical recruitment and safeguard conditions that ensure \ndecent work \n7. \nAddress and reduce vulnerabilities in migration \n8. \nSave lives and establish coordinated international efforts on missing migrants \n9. \nStrengthen the transnational response to smuggling of migrants \n10.

Establish mechanisms for the portability of social security entitlements and \nearned benefits \n23. Strengthen international cooperation and global partnerships for safe, orderly \nand regular migration \n \n \n \n \n \nObjectives and commitments \n \n \nObjective 1: Collect and utilize accurate and disaggregated data as a basis \nfor evidence-based policies \n \n17. We commit to strengthen the global evidence base on international migration by \nimproving and investing in the collection, analysis and dissemination of accurate, \nreliable and comparable data, disaggregated by sex, age, migration status and other \ncharacteristics relevant in national contexts, while upholding the right to privacy \nunder international human rights law and protecting personal data. We further commit \nto ensure that this data fosters research, guides coherent and evidence-based \npolicymaking and well-informed public discourse, and allows for effective \nmonitoring and evaluation of the implementation of commitments over time.  \n \nTo realize this commitment, we will draw from the following actions: \n \n(a) \nElaborate and implement a comprehensive strategy for improving \nmigration data at the local, national, regional and global levels, with the participation \nof all relevant stakeholders, under the guidance of the Statistical Commission of the \nUnited Nations, by harmonizing methodologies for data collection, and strengthening \nanalysis and dissemination of migration-related data and indicators;  \n \n(b) \nImprove international comparability and compatibility of migration \nstatistics and national data systems, including by further developing and applying the \nstatistical definition of an international migrant, elaborating a set of standards to \n\nA/RES/73/195 \nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration\n \n18-22354\n8/36 \n \nmeasure migrant stocks and flows, and documenting migration patterns and trends, \ncharacteristics of migrants, as well as drivers and impacts of migration; \n \n(c) \nDevelop a global programme to build and enhance national capacities in \ndata collection, analysis and dissemination to share data, address data gaps and assess \nkey migration trends, that encourages collaboration between relevant stakeholders at \nall levels, provides dedicated training, financial support and technical assistance, \nleverages new data sources, including big data, and is reviewed by the Statistical \nCommission on a regular basis; \n \n(d) \nCollect, analyse and use data on the effects and benefits of migration, as \nwell as the contributions of migrants and diasporas to sustainable development, with \na view to informing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment and related strategies and programmes at the local, national, regional \nand global levels;  \n \n(e) \nSupport further development of and collaboration between existing global \nand regional databases and depositories, including the International Organization for \nMigration (IOM) Global Migration Data Portal and the World Bank Global \nKnowledge Partnership on Migration and Development, with a view to systematically \nconsolidating relevant data in a transparent and user-friendly manner, while \nencouraging inter-agency collaboration to avoid duplication; \n \n(f) \nEstablish and strengthen regional centres for research and training on \nmigration or migration observatories, such as the African Observatory for Migration \nand Development, to collect and analyse data in line with United Nations standards, \nincluding on best practices, the contributions of migrants, the overall economic, social \nand political benefits and challenges of migration in countries of origin, transit and \ndestination, as well as drivers of migration, with a view to establishing shared \nstrategies and maximizing the value of disaggregated migration data, in coordination \nwith existing regional and subregional mechanisms; \n \n(g) \nImprove national data collection by integrating migration-related topics \ninto national censuses, as early as practicable, such as on country of birth, country of \nbirth of parents, country of citizenship, country of residence five years prior to the \ncensus, most recent arrival date and reason for migrating, to ensure timely analysis \nand dissemination of results, disaggregated and tabulated in accordance with \ninternational standards, for statistical purposes; \n \n(h) \nConduct household, labour force and other surveys to collect information \non the social and economic integration of migrants or add standard migration modules \nto existing household surveys to improve national, regional and international \ncomparability, and make collected data available through public use of statistical \nmicrodata files;  \n \n(i) \nEnhance collaboration between State units responsible for migration data \nand national statistical offices to produce migration-related statistics, including by \nusing administrative records for statistical purposes, such as border records, visas, \nresident permits, population registers and other relevant sources, while upholding the \nright to privacy and protecting personal data; \n \n(j) \nDevelop and use country-specific migration profiles, which include \ndisaggregated data on all migration-relevant aspects in a national context, including \nthose on labour market needs, demand for and availability of skills, the economic, \nenvironmental and social impacts of migration, remittance transfer costs, health, \neducation, occupation, living and working conditions, wages, and the needs of \nmigrants and receiving communities, in order to develop evidence-based migration \npolicies;  \n\nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration \nA/RES/73/195\n \n9/36\n18-22354 \n \n \n(k) \nCooperate with relevant stakeholders in countries of origin, transit and \ndestination to develop research, studies and surveys on the interrelationship between \nmigration and the three dimensions of sustainable development, the contributions and \nskills of migrants and diasporas, as well as their ties to the countries of origin and \ndestination. \n \nObjective 2: Minimize the adverse drivers and structural factors that compel \npeople to leave their country of origin \n \n18. We commit to create conducive political, economic, social and environmental \nconditions for people to lead peaceful, productive and sustainable lives in their own \ncountry and to fulfil their personal aspirations, while ensuring that desperation and \ndeteriorating environments do not compel them to seek a livelihood elsewhere \nthrough irregular migration. We further commit to ensure timely and full \nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as to build \nupon and invest in the implementation of other existing frameworks, in order to \nenhance the overall impact of the Global Compact to facilitate safe, orderly and \nregular migration.  \n \nTo realize this commitment, we will draw from the following actions:  \n \n(a) \nPromote the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment, including the Sustainable Development Goals and the Addis Ababa \nAction Agenda, and the commitment to reach the furthest behind first, as well as the \nParis Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030; \n \n(b) \nInvest in programmes that accelerate States\u2019 fulfilment of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals with the aim of eliminating the adverse drivers and structural \nfactors that compel people to leave their country of origin, including through poverty \neradication, food security, health and sanitation, education, inclusive economic \ngrowth, infrastructure, urban and rural development, employment creation, decent \nwork, gender equality and empowerment of women and girls, resilience and disaster \nrisk reduction, climate change mitigation and adaptation, addressing the \nsocioeconomic effects of all forms of violence, non-discrimination, the rule of law \nand good governance, access to justice and protection of human rights, as well as \ncreating and maintaining peaceful and inclusive societies with effective, accountable \nand transparent institutions;  \n \n(c) \nEstablish or strengthen mechanisms to monitor and anticipate the \ndevelopment of risks and threats that might trigger or affect migration movements, \nstrengthen early warning systems, develop emergency procedures and toolkits, launch \nemergency operations and support post-emergency recovery, in close cooperation \nwith and in support of other States, relevant national and local authorities, national \nhuman rights institutions and civil society;  \n \n(d) \nInvest in sustainable development at the local and national levels in all \nregions, allowing all people to improve their lives and meet their aspirations, by \nfostering sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, including through \nprivate and foreign direct investment and trade preferences, to create conducive \nconditions that allow communities and individuals to take advantage of opportunities \nin their own countries and drive sustainable development; \n \n(e) \nInvest in human capital development by promoting entrepreneurship, \neducation, vocational training and skills development programmes and partnerships, \nproductive employment creation, in line with labour market needs, as well as in \ncooperation with the private sector and trade unions, with a view to reducing youth \nunemployment, avoiding brain drain and optimizing brain gain in countries of origin, \nand harnessing the demographic dividend; \n\nA/RES/73/195 \nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration\n \n18-22354\n10/36 \n \n \n(f) \nStrengthen collaboration between humanitarian and development actors, \nincluding by promoting joint analysis, multi-donor approaches and multi-year \nfunding cycles, in order to develop long-term responses and outcomes that ensure \nrespect for the rights of affected individuals, resilience and coping capacities of \npopulations, as well as economic and social self-reliance, and by ensuring that these \nefforts take migration into account;  \n \n(g) \nAccount for migrants in national emergency preparedness and response, \nincluding by taking into consideration relevant recommendations from State-led \nconsultative processes, such as the Guidelines to Protect Migrants in Countries \nExperiencing Con\ufb02ict or Natural Disaster (Migrants in Countries in Crisis Initiative \nGuidelines); \n \n \n \nNatural disasters, the adverse effects of climate change, and \nenvironmental degradation \n \n \n(h) \nStrengthen joint analysis and sharing of information to better map, \nunderstand, predict and address migration movements, such as those that may result \nfrom sudden-onset and slow-onset natural disasters, the adverse effects of climate \nchange, environmental degradation, as well as other precarious situations, while \nensuring effective respect for and protection and fulfilment of the human rights of all \nmigrants; \n \n(i) \nDevelop adaptation and resilience strategies to sudden-onset and slow-\nonset natural disasters, the adverse effects of climate change, and environmental \ndegradation, such as desertification, land degradation, drought and sea level rise, \ntaking into account the potential implications for migration, while recognizing that \nadaptation in the country of origin is a priority; \n \n(j) \nIntegrate displacement considerations into disaster preparedness strategies \nand promote cooperation with neighbouring and other relevant countries to prepare \nfor early warning, contingency planning, stockpiling, coordination mechanisms, \nevacuation planning, reception and assistance arrangements, and public information;

We commit to promote faster, safer and cheaper remittances by further \ndeveloping existing conducive policy and regulatory environments that enable \ncompetition, regulation and innovation on the remittance market and by providing \ngender-responsive programmes and instruments that enhance the financial inclusion \nof migrants and their families.

We also \ncommit to create conducive conditions for personal safety, economic empowerment, \ninclusion and social cohesion in communities, in order to ensure that reintegration of \nmigrants upon return to their countries of origin is sustainable.  \n \nTo realize this commitment, we will draw from the following actions:  \n \n(a) \nDevelop and implement bilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation \nframeworks and agreements, including readmission agreements, ensuring that return \nand readmission of migrants to their own country is safe, dignified and in full \ncompliance with international human rights law, including the rights of the child, by \ndetermining clear and mutually agreed procedures that uphold procedural safeguards, \nguarantee individual assessments and legal certainty, and by ensuring that they also \ninclude provisions that facilitate sustainable reintegration; \n \n(b) \nPromote gender-responsive and child-sensitive return and reintegration \nprogrammes that may include legal, social and financial support, guaranteeing that \n\nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration \nA/RES/73/195\n \n31/36\n18-22354 \n \nall returns in the context of such voluntary programmes effectively take place on the \nbasis of the migrant\u2019s free, prior and informed consent, and that returning migrants \nare assisted in their reintegration process through effective partnerships, including to \navoid their becoming displaced in the country of origin upon return;  \n \n(c) \nCooperate on identification of nationals and issuance of travel documents \nfor safe and dignified return and readmission in cases of persons who do not have the \nlegal right to stay on another State\u2019s territory, by establishing reliable and efficient \nmeans of identification of our own nationals such as through the addition of biometric \nidentifiers in population registries, and by digitalizing civil registry systems, with full \nrespect for the right to privacy and protection of personal data; \n \n(d) \nFoster institutional contacts between consular authorities and relevant \nofficials from countries of origin and destination, and provide adequate consular \nassistance to returning migrants prior to return by facilitating access to documentation, \ntravel documents and other services, in order to ensure predictability, safety and \ndignity in return and readmission; \n \n(e) \nEnsure that the return of migrants who do not have the legal right to stay \non another State\u2019s territory is safe and dignified, follows an individual assessment, is \ncarried out by competent authorities through prompt and effective cooperation \nbetween countries of origin and destination, and allows all applicable legal remedies \nto be exhausted, in compliance with due process guarantees and other obligations \nunder international human rights law; \n \n(f) \nEstablish or strengthen national monitoring mechanisms on return, in \npartnership with relevant stakeholders, that provide independent recommendations on \nways and means to strengthen accountability, in order to guarantee the safety, dignity \nand human rights of all returning migrants; \n \n(g) \nEnsure that return and readmission processes involving children are \ncarried out only after a determination of the best interests of the child and take into \naccount the right to family life and family unity, and that a parent, legal guardian or \nspecialized official accompanies the child throughout the return process, ensuring that \nappropriate reception, care and reintegration arrangements for children are in place \nin the country of origin upon return; \n \n(h) \nFacilitate the sustainable reintegration of returning migrants into \ncommunity life by providing them with equal access to social protection and services, \njustice, psychosocial assistance, vocational training, employment opportunities and \ndecent work, recognition of skills acquired abroad, and financial services, in order to \nfully build upon their entrepreneurship, skills and human capital as active members \nof society and contributors to sustainable development in the country of origin upon \nreturn; \n \n(i) \nIdentify and address the needs of the communities to which migrants \nreturn by including respective provisions in national and local development strategies, \ninfrastructure planning, budget allocations and other relevant policy decisions and \ncooperating with local authorities and relevant stakeholders. \n \nObjective 22: Establish mechanisms for the portability of social security \nentitlements and earned benefits \n \n38. We commit to assist migrant workers at all skills levels to have access to social \nprotection in countries of destination and profit from the portability of applicable \nsocial security entitlements and earned benefits in their countries of origin or when \nthey decide to take up work in another country.  \n\nA/RES/73/195 \nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration\n \n18-22354\n32/36 \n \n \nTo realize this commitment, we will draw from the following actions:  \n \n(a) \nEstablish or maintain non-discriminatory national social protection \nsystems, including social protection floors for nationals and migrants, in line with the \nILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202); \n \n(b) \nConclude reciprocal bilateral, regional or multilateral social security \nagreements on the portability of earned benefits for migrant workers at all skills \nlevels, that refer to applicable social protection floors in the respective States and \napplicable social security entitlements and provisions, such as pensions, health care \nor other earned benefits, or integrate such provisions into other relevant agreements, \nsuch as those on long-term and temporary labour migration; \n \n(c) \nIntegrate provisions on the portability of entitlements and earned benefits \ninto national social security frameworks, designate focal points in countries of origin, \ntransit and destination that facilitate portability requests from migrants, address the \ndifficulties women and older persons can face in accessing social protection, and \nestablish dedicated instruments, such as migrant welfare funds in countries of origin, \nthat support migrant workers and their families.  \n \nObjective 23: Strengthen international cooperation and global partnerships \nfor safe, orderly and regular migration \n \n39.

We further commit to take joint action, in addressing the \nchallenges faced by each country, to implement this Global Compact, underscoring \nthe specific challenges faced in particular by African countries, least developed \ncountries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States and \nmiddle-income countries. We also commit to promote the mutually reinforcing nature \nbetween the Global Compact and existing international legal and policy frameworks, \nby aligning the implementation of this Global Compact with such frameworks, \nparticularly the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as well as the Addis Ababa \nAction Agenda, and their recognition that migration and sustainable development are \nmultidimensional and interdependent.  \n \nTo realize this commitment, we will draw from the following actions:  \n \n(a) \nSupport other States as we collectively implement the Global Compact, \nincluding through the provision of financial and technical assistance, in line with \nnational priorities, policies, action plans and strategies, through a whole-of-\ngovernment and whole-of-society approach; \n \n(b) \nIncrease international and regional cooperation to accelerate the \nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in geographical \nareas from which irregular migration systematically originates owing to consistent \nimpacts of poverty, unemployment, climate change and disasters, inequality, \ncorruption and poor governance, among other structural factors, through appropriate \ncooperation frameworks, innovative partnerships and the involvement of all relevant \nstakeholders, while upholding national ownership and shared responsibility; \n \n(c) \nInvolve and support local authorities in the identification of needs and \nopportunities for international cooperation for the effective implementation of the \nGlobal Compact and integrate their perspectives and priorities into development \nstrategies, programmes and planning on migration, as a means to ensure good \n\nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration \nA/RES/73/195\n \n33/36\n18-22354 \n \ngovernance as well as policy coherence across levels of government and policy \nsectors, and maximize the effectiveness and impact of international development \ncooperation; \n \n(d) \nMake use of the capacity-building mechanism and build upon other \nexisting instruments to strengthen the capacities of relevant authorities by mobilizing \ntechnical, financial and human resources from States, international financial \ninstitutions, the private sector, international organizations and other sources in order \nto assist all States in fulfilling the commitments outlined in this Global Compact;  \n \n(e) \nConclude bilateral, regional or multilateral mutually beneficial, tailored \nand transparent partnerships, in line with international law, that develop targeted \nsolutions to migration policy issues of common interest and address opportunities and \nchallenges of migration in accordance with the Global Compact.  \n \n \n \n \nImplementation \n \n \n40. For the effective implementation of the Global Compact, we require concerted \nefforts at the global, regional, national and local levels, including a coherent United \nNations system.  \n41. We commit to fulfil the objectives and commitments outlined in the Global \nCompact, in line with our vision and guiding principles, by taking effective steps at \nall levels to facilitate safe, orderly and regular migration at all stages. We will \nimplement the Global Compact, within our own countries and at the regional and \nglobal levels, taking into account different national realities, capacities and levels of \ndevelopment, and respecting national policies and priorities. We reaffirm our \ncommitment to international law and emphasize that the Global Compact is to be \nimplemented in a manner that is consistent with our rights and obligations under \ninternational law. \n42. We will implement the Global Compact through enhanced bilateral, regional \nand multilateral cooperation and a revitalized global partnership in a spirit of \nsolidarity. We will continue building on existing mechanisms, platforms and \nframeworks to address migration in all its dimensions. Recognizing the centrality of \ninternational cooperation for the effective fulfilment of the objectives and \ncommitments, we will strive to reinforce our engagement in North-South, South-\nSouth and triangular cooperation and assistance. Our cooperation efforts in this regard \nwill be aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis \nAbaba Action Agenda.  \n43. We decide to establish a capacity-building mechanism in the United Nations, \nbuilding upon existing initiatives, that supports efforts of Member States to \nimplement the Global Compact. It allows Member States, the United Nations and \nother relevant stakeholders, including the private sector and philanthropic \nfoundations, to contribute technical, financial and human resources on a voluntary \nbasis in order to strengthen capacities and foster multi-partner cooperation. The \ncapacity-building mechanism will consist of: \n \n(a) \nA connection hub that facilitates demand-driven, tailor-made and \nintegrated solutions, by: \n \n(i) \nAdvising on, assessing and processing country requests for the \ndevelopment of solutions; \n \n(ii) Identifying main implementing partners within and outside of the United \nNations system, in line with their comparative advantages and operational \ncapacities; \n\nA/RES/73/195 \nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration\n \n18-22354\n34/36 \n \n \n(iii) Connecting the request to similar initiatives and solutions for peer-to-peer \nexchange and potential replication, where existing and relevant; \n \n(iv) Ensuring effective set-up for multi-agency and multi-stakeholder \nimplementation; \n \n(v) \nIdentifying funding opportunities, including by initiating the start-up fund; \n \n(b) \nA start-up fund for initial financing to realize project-oriented solutions, by: \n \n(i) \nProviding seed funding, where needed, to jump-start a specific project; \n \n(ii) Complementing other funding sources; \n \n(iii) Receiving voluntary financial contributions by Member States, the United \nNations, international financial institutions and other stakeholders, including the \nprivate sector and philanthropic foundations; \n \n(c) \nA global knowledge platform as an online open data source, by:  \n \n(i) \nServing as a repository of existing evidence, practices and initiatives; \n \n(ii) Facilitating the accessibility of knowledge and sharing of solutions; \n \n(iii) Building on the Global Forum on Migration and Development Platform \nfor Partnerships and other relevant sources. \n44. We will implement the Global Compact in cooperation and partnership with \nmigrants, civil society, migrant and diaspora organizations, faith-based organizations, \nlocal authorities and communities, the private sector, trade unions, parliamentarians, \nnational human rights institutions, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent \nMovement, academia, the media and other relevant stakeholders. \n45. We welcome the decision of the Secretary-General to establish a United Nations \nnetwork on migration to ensure effective and coherent system-wide support for \nimplementation, including the capacity-building mechanism, as well as follow-up and \nreview of the Global Compact, in response to the needs of Member States. In this \nregard, we note that: \n \n(a) \nIOM will serve as the coordinator and secretariat of the network; \n \n(b) \nThe network will fully draw from the technical expertise and experience \nof relevant entities within the United Nations system; \n \n(c) \nThe work of the network will be fully aligned with existing coordination \nmechanisms and the repositioning of the United Nations development system. \n46. We request the Secretary-General, drawing on the network, to report to the \nGeneral Assembly on a biennial basis on the implementation of the Global Compact, \nthe activities of the United Nations system in this regard, as well as the functioning \nof the institutional arrangements. \n47. Further recognizing the important role of State-led processes and platforms at \nthe global and regional levels in advancing the international dialogue on migration, \nwe invite the Global Forum on Migration and Development, regional consultative \nprocesses and other global, regional and subregional forums to provide platforms to \nexchange experiences on the implementation of the Global Compact, share good \npractices on policies and cooperation, promote innovative approaches, and foster \nmulti-stakeholder partnerships around specific policy issues. \n \n \n\nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration \nA/RES/73/195\n \n35/36\n18-22354 \n \n \n \nFollow-up and review \n \n \n48. We will review the progress made at the local, national, regional and global \nlevels in implementing the Global Compact in the framework of the United Nations \nthrough a State-led approach and with the participation of all relevant stakeholders. \nFor follow-up and review, we agree on intergovernmental measures that will assist us \nin fulfilling our objectives and commitments.  \n49. Considering that international migration requires a forum at the global level \nthrough which Member States can review the implementation progress and guide the \ndirection of the work of the United Nations, we decide that: \n \n(a) \nThe High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, \ncurrently scheduled to take place every fourth session of the General Assembly, shall \nbe repurposed and renamed \u201cInternational Migration Review Forum\u201d; \n \n(b) \nThe International Migration Review Forum shall serve as the primary \nintergovernmental global platform for Member States to discuss and share progress \non the implementation of all aspects of the Global Compact, including as it relates to \nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and with the participation of all \nrelevant stakeholders; \n \n(c) \nThe International Migration Review Forum shall take place every four \nyears beginning in 2022; \n \n(d) \nThe International Migration Review Forum shall discuss the implementation \nof the Global Compact at the local, national, regional and global levels, as well as \nallow for interaction with other relevant stakeholders with a view to building upon \naccomplishments and identifying opportunities for further cooperation; \n \n(e) \nEach edition of the International Migration Review Forum will result in \nan intergovernmentally agreed Progress Declaration, which may be taken into \nconsideration by the high-level political forum on sustainable development. \n50. Considering that most international migration takes place within regions, we \ninvite relevant subregional, regional and cross-regional processes, platforms and \norganizations, including the United Nations regional economic commissions or \nregional consultative processes, to review the implementation of the Global Compact \nwithin the respective regions, beginning in 2020, alternating with discussions at the \nglobal level at a four-year interval, in order to effectively inform each edition of the \nInternational Migration Review Forum, with the participation of all relevant \nstakeholders. \n51. We invite the Global Forum on Migration and Development to provide a space \nfor annual informal exchange on the implementation of the Global Compact, and to \nreport the findings, best practices and innovative approaches to the International \nMigration Review Forum. \n52. Recognizing the important contributions of State-led initiatives on international \nmigration, we invite forums such as the IOM International Dialogue on Migration, \nregional consultative processes and others to contribute to the International Migration \nReview Forum by providing relevant data, evidence, best practices, innovative \napproaches and recommendations as they relate to the implementation of the Global \nCompact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. \n53. We encourage all Member States to develop, as soon as practicable, ambitious \nnational responses for the implementation of the Global Compact, and to conduct \nregular and inclusive reviews of progress at the national level, such as through the \n\nA/RES/73/195 \nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration\n \n18-22354\n36/36 \n \nvoluntary elaboration and use of a national implementation plan. Such reviews should \ndraw on contributions from all relevant stakeholders, as well as parliaments and local \nauthorities, and serve to effectively inform the participation of Member States in the \nInternational Migration Review Forum and other relevant forums.  \n54. We request the President of the General Assembly to launch and conclude, in \n2019, open, transparent and inclusive intergovernmental consultations to determine \nthe precise modalities and organizational aspects of the International Migration \nReview Forums and articulate how the contributions of the regional reviews and other \nrelevant processes will inform the Forums, as a means to further strengthen the overall \neffectiveness and consistency of the follow-up and review outlined in the Global \nCompact. \n \n",

To realize this commitment, we will draw from the following actions: (a) Support other States as we collectively implement the Global Compact, including through the provision of financial and technical assistance, in line with national priorities, policies, action plans and strategies, through a whole-of- government and whole-of-society approach; (b) Increase international and regional cooperation to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in geographical areas from which irregular migration systematically originates owing to consistent impacts of poverty, unemployment, climate change and disasters, inequality, corruption and poor governance, among other structural factors, through appropriate cooperation frameworks, innovative partnerships and the involvement of all relevant stakeholders, while upholding national ownership and shared responsibility; (c) Involve and support local authorities in the identification of needs and opportunities for international cooperation for the effective implementation of the Global Compact and integrate their perspectives and priorities into development strategies, programmes and planning on migration, as a means to ensure good Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration A/RES/73/195 33/36 18-22354 governance as well as policy coherence across levels of government and policy sectors, and maximize the effectiveness and impact of international development cooperation; (d) Make use of the capacity-building mechanism and build upon other existing instruments to strengthen the capacities of relevant authorities by mobilizing technical, financial and human resources from States, international financial institutions, the private sector, international organizations and other sources in order to assist all States in fulfilling the commitments outlined in this Global Compact; (e) Conclude bilateral, regional or multilateral mutually beneficial, tailored and transparent partnerships, in line with international law, that develop targeted solutions to migration policy issues of common interest and address opportunities and challenges of migration in accordance with the Global Compact.

Our cooperation efforts in this regard will be aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.",
    "43": "We decide to establish a capacity-building mechanism in the United Nations, building upon existing initiatives, that supports efforts of Member States to implement the Global Compact. It allows Member States, the United Nations and other relevant stakeholders, including the private sector and philanthropic foundations, to contribute technical, financial and human resources on a voluntary basis in order to strengthen capacities and foster multi-partner cooperation. The capacity-building mechanism will consist of: (a) A connection hub that facilitates demand-driven, tailor-made and integrated solutions, by: (i) Advising on, assessing and processing country requests for the development of solutions; (ii) Identifying main implementing partners within and outside of the United Nations system, in line with their comparative advantages and operational capacities; A/RES/73/195 Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration 18-22354 34/36 (iii) Connecting the request to similar initiatives and solutions for peer-to-peer exchange and potential replication, where existing and relevant; (iv) Ensuring effective set-up for multi-agency and multi-stakeholder implementation; (v) Identifying funding opportunities, including by initiating the start-up fund; (b) A start-up fund for initial financing to realize project-oriented solutions, by: (i) Providing seed funding, where needed, to jump-start a specific project; (ii) Complementing other funding sources; (iii) Receiving voluntary financial contributions by Member States, the United Nations, international financial institutions and other stakeholders, including the private sector and philanthropic foundations; (c) A global knowledge platform as an online open data source, by: (i) Serving as a repository of existing evidence, practices and initiatives; (ii) Facilitating the accessibility of knowledge and sharing of solutions; (iii) Building on the Global Forum on Migration and Development Platform for Partnerships and other relevant sources.",

    "45": "We welcome the decision of the Secretary-General to establish a United Nations network on migration to ensure effective and coherent system-wide support for implementation, including the capacity-building mechanism, as well as follow-up and review of the Global Compact, in response to the needs of Member States. In this regard, we note that: (a) IOM will serve as the coordinator and secretariat of the network; (b) The network will fully draw from the technical expertise and experience of relevant entities within the United Nations system; (c) The work of the network will be fully aligned with existing coordination mechanisms and the repositioning of the United Nations development system.",

For follow-up and review, we agree on intergovernmental measures that will assist us in fulfilling our objectives and commitments.",
    "49": "Considering that international migration requires a forum at the global level through which Member States can review the implementation progress and guide the direction of the work of the United Nations, we decide that: (a) The High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, currently scheduled to take place every fourth session of the General Assembly, shall be repurposed and renamed \u201cInternational Migration Review Forum\u201d; (b) The International Migration Review Forum shall serve as the primary intergovernmental global platform for Member States to discuss and share progress on the implementation of all aspects of the Global Compact, including as it relates to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and with the participation of all relevant stakeholders; (c) The International Migration Review Forum shall take place every four years beginning in 2022; (d) The International Migration Review Forum shall discuss the implementation of the Global Compact at the local, national, regional and global levels, as well as allow for interaction with other relevant stakeholders with a view to building upon accomplishments and identifying opportunities for further cooperation; (e) Each edition of the International Migration Review Forum will result in an intergovernmentally agreed Progress Declaration, which may be taken into consideration by the high-level political forum on sustainable development.",
    "50": "Considering that most international migration takes place within regions, we invite relevant subregional, regional and cross-regional processes, platforms and organizations, including the United Nations regional economic commissions or regional consultative processes, to review the implementation of the Global Compact within the respective regions, beginning in 2020, alternating with discussions at the global level at a four-year interval, in order to effectively inform each edition of the International Migration Review Forum, with the participation of all relevant stakeholders.",

    "53": "We encourage all Member States to develop, as soon as practicable, ambitious national responses for the implementation of the Global Compact, and to conduct regular and inclusive reviews of progress at the national level, such as through the A/RES/73/195 Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration 18-22354 36/36 voluntary elaboration and use of a national implementation plan. Such reviews should draw on contributions from all relevant stakeholders, as well as parliaments and local authorities, and serve to effectively inform the participation of Member States in the International Migration Review Forum and other relevant forums.",
    "54": "We request the President of the General Assembly to launch and conclude, in 2019, open, transparent and inclusive intergovernmental consultations to determine the precise modalities and organizational aspects of the International Migration Review Forums and articulate how the contributions of the regional reviews and other relevant processes will inform the Forums, as a means to further strengthen the overall effectiveness and consistency of the follow-up and review outlined in the Global Compact."
