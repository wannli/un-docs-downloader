\nconsideration of the items referred to it. It shall at the beginning of the session \nadopt a programme of work indicating, if possible, a target date for the \n\nA/C.6/80/L.1 \n \n25-14774\n6/10 \n \nconclusion of its work, the approximate dates of consideration of items and the \nnumber of meetings to be allocated to each item. \n5. \nPursuant to General Assembly resolution 77/335 on further measures for the \nrevitalization of the work of the Assembly, upon the recommendation of the Sixth \nCommittee, the Assembly, at its 47th plenary meeting, held on 4 December 2024, \nadopted decision 79/524 containing the provisional programme of work of the \nCommittee for the eightieth session of the Assembly. \n6. \nThe General Assembly, at its 2nd plenary meeting, held on 12 September 2025, \nupon the recommendation of the General Committee (see A/80/250), fixed the target \ndate of 21 November 2025 for the completion of the work of the Sixth Committee. \n7. \nThe Bureau of the Committee has considered the provisional programme of \nwork as contained in decision 79/524 and has taken into account the allocation of \nadditional items (requests for observer status in the General Assembly) to the \nCommittee by the General Assembly, as well as the reduction of the length of the \nreport of the International Law Commission on the work of its seventy-sixth session \n(as a consequence of the reduction of the length of the Commission\u2019s session) and the \nanticipated workload at the present session.

In the light of that, three \nmeetings, to be held on 15 October and 3 and 7 November, have been suggested for \nthat purpose. \n9. \nConcerning agenda item 109, entitled \u201cMeasures to eliminate international \nterrorism\u201d, the General Assembly, by its resolution 79/129, decided to recommend \nthat the Sixth Committee, at the eightieth session of the Assembly, establish a working \ngroup with a view to finalizing the process on the draft comprehensive convention on \ninternational terrorism as well as discussions on the item included in its agenda by \nAssembly resolution 54/110 concerning the question of convening a high-level \nconference under the auspices of the United Nations. In the light of that, two \nmeetings, to be held on 17 October and 6 November, have been suggested for that \npurpose. \n10. The consideration of the reports of the working groups in plenary is scheduled \nfor 14 November. It has also been suggested that the following be held: a briefing on \nagenda item 77, entitled \u201cCriminal accountability of United Nations officials and \nexperts on mission\u201d, on 16 October; and an informal briefing on agenda item 146, \nentitled \u201cAdministration of justice at the United Nations\u201d, on 17 October. \n11. In view of the limited conference services available to the Sixth Committee (see \npara. 22), any meetings for the working groups or for informal consultations are \naccommodated within the overall meetings allocated to the Committee. \n12. Concerning agenda item 86, entitled \u201cProtection of persons in the event of \ndisasters\u201d, the General Assembly, by its resolution 79/128, decided that the Sixth \nCommittee shall resume its session for up to five days by the end of April 2026 at the \nlatest, in order to prepare a consolidated text that will serve as the basis for the \nnegotiations of a legally binding instrument on the protection of persons in the event \nof disasters, including the draft articles on the protection of persons in the event of \ndisasters and the proposals submitted by Governments, within the framework of a \nworking group of the Committee. It is expected that the Sixth Committee will include, \nin the forthcoming draft resolution to be prepared under the agenda item, an indication \nof the dates and number of meetings of the working group. \n \nStatements by delegations \n \n13. The list of speakers for the debate on all agenda items opened on 15 September \n2025. Delegations are invited to inscribe their names on the list of speakers through \nthe eSpeakers module for the Sixth Committee in the e-deleGATE portal, preferably \n\nA/C.6/80/L.1\n \n9/10\n25-14774 \n \nby 5 p.m. on the Friday preceding the week in which each agenda item is scheduled \nto be considered (unless otherwise indicated). The live list of speakers for each agenda \nitem can be accessed through the e-deleGATE portal, or from the website of the Sixth \nCommittee.3 \n14. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 72/313, delegations are encouraged to \nadhere to the \u201call protocol observed\u201d principle and to refrain from listing standard \nprotocol expressions during their statements. In the same resolution, the Assembly \nrecommended that speakers should be mindful of the speed of statement delivery, \nbearing in mind the need for accuracy of interpretation. The delivery of national \nstatements will be limited to 7 minutes, and group statements to 12 minutes, for all \nagenda items except those dealing with the annual report of the International Law \nCommission, for which delegations are encouraged to limit their statements to main \npositions and views for a total of 12 minutes (with further information or clarifications \nprovided in written versions made available through the eStatements portal or in \nwritten submissions to the Commission). \n15. In accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, delegations should \nexercise their right of reply at the end of the day whenever two meetings have been \nscheduled for the consideration of the relevant agenda item on that day, or at the \nconclusion of the consideration of the item, if that is sooner. The first statement should \nbe limited to five minutes and the second, if any, to three minutes. \n \nDraft resolutions \n \n16. The initiation and sponsorship of draft resolutions, where applicable, will be \nundertaken electronically through the eSponsorship module for the Sixth Committee \nin the e-deleGATE portal. \n17. Unless otherwise agreed, coordinators or main sponsors, as applicable, of \nproposals for draft resolutions are encouraged to hold at least one informal \nconsultation per proposal. The Secretariat will provide assistance where necessary. \nInformal consultations should be announced sufficiently in advance, including in the \nJournal of the United Nations, so as to allow participation by representatives of all \nMember States. Once consultations have concluded, it is the practice of the Sixth \nCommittee to place proposals for draft resolutions under a silence procedure, prior to \ntheir submission for processing and issuance in all official languages as limited (\u201cL\u201d) \ndocuments. \n18. All delegations wishing to sponsor a proposal for a draft resolution, where \napplicable, are encouraged to do so electronically through the eSponsorship module, \nrather than during the formal proceedings of the Committee. This is without prejudice \nto the possibility of delegations sponsoring a proposal for a draft resolution at the \ntime of the Committee\u2019s action on the latter during a plenary meeting. Sponsorship \nshould take place at the level of the Sixth Committee, given that, once the Committee \nhas adopted a proposal for a draft resolution and recommended its adoption by the \nGeneral Assembly, its sponsorship can no longer be altered by Member States. \nProposals for draft resolutions submitted on behalf of the Bureau are not subject to \nsponsorship. \n19. Pursuant to rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, \u201cno \nresolution involving expenditure shall be recommended by a committee for approval \nby the General Assembly unless it is accompanied by an estimate of expenditures \nprepared by the Secretary-General\u201d. It is therefore imperative that the Sixth \nCommittee allow sufficient time for the preparation of estimates of expenditure by \n__________________ \n \n3 See www.un.org/en/ga/sixth/80/programme.shtml. \n\nA/C.6/80/L.1 \n \n25-14774\n10/10 \n \nthe Secretariat and for their consideration by the Advisory Committee on \nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth Committee. Bearing in mind \nthat 21 November has been fixed as the concluding date for the work of the Sixth \nCommittee (see para. 6), 7 November would have to be considered the mandatory \ndeadline for submission to the Fifth Committee of draft resolutions with financial \nimplications, except for draft resolutions concerning items to be considered after that \ndate. When submitting such proposals, delegations may also wish to bear in mind \nthat, in most cases, a period of more than 48 hours, up to four days, is required for \nthe Secretary-General to review the programme budget implications of proposals. \nAccordingly, the deadline for finalization and submission of all draft resolutions for \nbudget review and processing is 14 November 2025. \n20. Each coordinator or main sponsor, as applicable, of proposals for draft \nresolutions will be invited to introduce their respective draft resolutions as issued in \nlimited distribution (\u201cL\u201d) documents. Such introductions take place at plenary \nmeetings, and will be announced in advance, including in the Journal. \n21. Except for draft resolutions introduced at the final meeting of the substantive \npart of the session on 21 November 2025, it is the practice of the Committee to take \naction on each draft resolution at the plenary meeting following that at which the draft \nresolution was introduced, or at a later date. Any anticipated action on draft \nresolutions or decisions will be announced in advance, including in the Journal and \non the website of the Committee. It is the practice of the Sixth Committee to strive \nfor the adoption of draft resolutions without taking a vote. \n \nConference resources available \n \n22. The available conference facilities will, in principle, enable the Committee to \nhold between three and six plenary meetings per week. Morning meetings will be held \nfrom 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and afternoon meetings from 3 to 6 p.m. \n23. Unless otherwise specified, formal meetings of the Committee will be held from \n10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 to 6 p.m. in the Trusteeship Council Chamber. The General \nAssembly has stressed that a punctual start to the meetings is critical to the efficient \nutilization of services allocated to the intergovernmental bodies of the United Nations. \nIn accordance with past practice, rule 108 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly \ncould be waived with respect to the quorum needed to declare a meeting open. \n \n",

The delivery of national statements will be limited to 7 minutes, and group statements to 12 minutes, for all agenda items except those dealing with the annual report of the International Law Commission, for which delegations are encouraged to limit their statements to main positions and views for a total of 12 minutes (with further information or clarifications provided in written versions made available through the eStatements portal or in written submissions to the Commission).",

Once consultations have concluded, it is the practice of the Sixth Committee to place proposals for draft resolutions under a silence procedure, prior to their submission for processing and issuance in all official languages as limited (\u201cL\u201d) documents.",
    "18": "All delegations wishing to sponsor a proposal for a draft resolution, where applicable, are encouraged to do so electronically through the eSponsorship module, rather than during the formal proceedings of the Committee.

It is therefore imperative that the Sixth Committee allow sufficient time for the preparation of estimates of expenditure by the Secretariat and for their consideration by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth Committee. Bearing in mind that 21 November has been fixed as the concluding date for the work of the Sixth Committee (see para. 6), 7 November would have to be considered the mandatory deadline for submission to the Fifth Committee of draft resolutions with financial implications, except for draft resolutions concerning items to be considered after that date. When submitting such proposals, delegations may also wish to bear in mind that, in most cases, a period of more than 48 hours, up to four days, is required for the Secretary-General to review the programme budget implications of proposals. Accordingly, the deadline for finalization and submission of all draft resolutions for budget review and processing is 14 November 2025.",

    "21": "Except for draft resolutions introduced at the final meeting of the substantive part of the session on 21 November 2025, it is the practice of the Committee to take action on each draft resolution at the plenary meeting following that at which the draft resolution was introduced, or at a later date. Any anticipated action on draft resolutions or decisions will be announced in advance, including in the Journal and on the website of the Committee. It is the practice of the Sixth Committee to strive for the adoption of draft resolutions without taking a vote. Conference resources available",
    "22": "The available conference facilities will, in principle, enable the Committee to hold between three and six plenary meetings per week. Morning meetings will be held from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and afternoon meetings from 3 to 6 p.m.",
