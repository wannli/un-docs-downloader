international \norganizations to contribute, at the global, regional, subregional and bilateral levels, \nthrough cooperation programmes with Governments, to the development of national \ncapacity in marine science and the sustainable management of the oceans and their \nresources, \n \nRecalling that marine science is important for eradicating poverty, contributing \nto food security, conserving the world\u2019s marine environment and resources, helping \nto understand, predict and respond to natural events and promoting the sustainable \ndevelopment of the oceans and seas, by improving knowledge, through sustained \nresearch efforts and the evaluation of monitoring results, and applying such \nknowledge to management and decision-making, \n \nExpressing deep concern at the adverse economic, social and environmental \nimpacts of the physical alteration and destruction of marine habitats that may result \nfrom land-based and coastal development activities, in particular those land \nreclamation activities that are carried out in a manner that has a detrimental impact \non the marine environment, \n \nReiterating its serious concern at the current and projected adverse effects of \nclimate change, including rising seawater temperature, ocean deoxygenation, and sea \nlevel rise, as well as ocean acidification, on the marine environment and marine \nbiodiversity, and emphasizing the urgency of addressing these adverse effects, \nconsidering also the importance of preserving the role of the ocean as a carbon sink, \n \nNoting with concern, in this regard, the findings by the World Meteorological \nOrganization, in its Greenhouse Gas Bulletin No. 21, that, in 2024, carbon dioxide \nlevels in the atmosphere were at 423.9 plus or minus 0.2 parts per million, which \nrepresents an increase of 3.5 parts per million, a relative increase of 0.83 per cent, \nover the period 2023\u20132024, and the findings in the World Meteorological \nOrganization State of the Global Climate 2024 that the global mean temperature in \n2024 was about 1.55 degrees Celsius above the 1850 to 1900 baseline, \n \nNoting with concern also that the World Meteorological Organization, in its \nState of the Global Climate 2024, highlighted that the past 10 years, from 2015 to \n2024, were individually the 10 warmest on record, and in 2024 ocean heat content \nreached its highest recorded level and global mean sea level reached a record high, \nwhile the world also continued to see increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases \nand ocean acidification, and the cryosphere continued its contraction, \n \nExpressing concern that climate change continues to increase the severity and \nincidence of coral bleaching throughout tropical seas and weakens the ability of reefs \nto withstand ocean acidification, which could have serious and irreversible negative \neffects on marine organisms, particularly corals, as well as to withstand other \npressures, including overfishing and pollution, \n \nReiterating its deep concern at the vulnerability of the environment and the \nfragile ecosystems of the polar regions particularly affected by the observed and

protection, including the \nprotection of vulnerable marine ecosystems, and the economics of the global shipping \nindustry, and encouraging further efforts towards electronic charting, which not only \nprovides significantly increased benefits for safe navigation and management of ship \nmovement, but also provides data and information that can be used for sustainably \nmanaged fisheries and sustainably managed aquaculture activities and other sectoral \nuses of the marine environment, the delimitation of maritime boundaries and \nenvironmental protection, and noting that, under the International Convention for the \nSafety of Life at Sea, 1974,12 ships on international voyages are required to carry an \nelectronic chart display and information system, in accordance with the \nimplementation schedule as set out in that Convention, \n \nNoting with concern threats to maritime safety and security, including piracy, \narmed robbery at sea, smuggling and terrorist acts against shipping, offshore \ninstallations and other maritime interests, and the continuing problem of transnational \norganized crime committed at sea, including illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and
