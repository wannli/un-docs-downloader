\n \n8. \nEmphasize the burden of noncommunicable diseases, which, together, \naccount for more than 43 million deaths each year, 18 million of which occur \nprematurely (before the age of 70) and include cardiovascular diseases \u2013 which \naccount for the largest share of these deaths \u2013 cancers, diabetes and chronic \n_______________ \n \n1 Resolution 66/2, annex. \n \n2 Resolution 68/300. \n \n3 Resolution 73/2. \n \n4 Resolution 74/2. \n \n5 Resolution 78/4, annex. \n \n6 Resolution 78/3, annex. \n \n7 Resolution 78/5, annex. \n \n8 Resolution 79/2, annex. \n \n9 A/79/762. \n\nPolitical declaration of the fourth high-level meeting of the \nGeneral Assembly on the prevention and control of noncommunicable \ndiseases and the promotion of mental health and well-being \nA/RES/80/117\n \n3/14\n25-20712 \n \nrespiratory diseases, while recognizing the burden of conditions beyond these four \nmain noncommunicable diseases; \n \n9. \nNote with concern that there are: (a) 1.3 billion adults living with \nhypertension and only one in five have it under control; (b) 800 million adults living \nwith diabetes; (c) one in five people developing cancer during their lifetime, with \n20 million new cases annually, of which 400,000 are children; (d) 3.7 billion people \nsuffering from oral diseases; (e) more than 674 million people affected by chronic \nkidney disease; and (f) over 300 million persons living with rare diseases; \n \n10. Emphasize that mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression \nand psychosis, affect close to 1 billion people worldwide and can commonly co-occur \nand interact with other neurological conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and \nother forms of dementia, stroke sequelae, Parkinson\u2019s disease, epilepsy and other \nnoncommunicable diseases, as well as substance abuse, and that suicide is the third \nleading cause of death among those 15 to 29 years old; \n \n11. Recognize that noncommunicable diseases and mental health and well-\nbeing are closely intertwined with brain health and neurological conditions, that \nmental health conditions and neurological conditions contribute to the global \nincidence and impact of noncommunicable diseases and that persons living with \nmental health conditions and neurological conditions also have an increased risk of \nother noncommunicable diseases and therefore have higher rates of morbidity and \nmortality; \n \n12. Recognize also that the main modifiable risk factors of noncommunicable \ndiseases are tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity \nand air pollution and are largely preventable and require cross-sectoral actions; \n \n13. Emphasize with concern that, globally, there are: (a) 1.3 billion tobacco \nusers and more than 7 million tobacco-related deaths each year, including an \nestimated 1.6 million non\u2011smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke; \n(b) 2.6 million deaths each year attributable to alcohol consumption; (c) 35 million \nchildren under 5 years of age currently overweight; (d) 390 million children 5 to \n19 years old who are overweight or obese, while adult obesity has more than doubled \nsince 1990; and (e) nearly 7 million deaths each year caused by air pollution, with \n99 per cent of the population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels; \n \n14. Emphasize that noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions \nprevent people and communities from reaching their full potential, pose a heavy \neconomic burden, limit human capital development, can undermine the sustainability \nof health systems and, together with other health conditions, compound cycles of \npoverty and disadvantage; \n \n15. Recognize that the human and economic cost of noncommunicable \ndiseases and mental health conditions contributes to poverty and inequalities and \nthreatens the health of peoples and the development of countries, and that there are \npublic health risks associated with increased urbanization, including unhealthy diets, \nmalnutrition and hunger, sedentary lifestyles and physical inactivity, requiring \ncommitments to mobilize and allocate adequate, predictable and sustained resources \nfor national responses to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases, including \nthrough international cooperation and official development assistance; \n \n16. Recognize also that noncommunicable diseases, mental health conditions \nand their underlying risk factors and determinants affect people at all ages, including \nchildren and young people; \n \n17. Recognize further the increasing gap between life expectancy and healthy \nlife expectancy for older persons and note that, despite the progress achieved at the \n\nA/RES/80/117 \nPolitical declaration of the fourth high-level meeting of the \nGeneral Assembly on the prevention and control of noncommunicable \ndiseases and the promotion of mental health and well-being\n \n25-20712\n4/14 \n \nglobal level, many health systems continue to be inadequately prepared to identify \nand respond to the growing needs of the rapidly ageing population, including the \nincreased prevalence of noncommunicable diseases; \n \n18. Acknowledge that mainstreaming a gender perspective into the prevention \nand control of noncommunicable diseases is crucial to understanding and addressing \nhealth risks and needs of women and men of all ages, giving particular attention to \nthe impact of noncommunicable diseases on women in all settings; \n \n19. Recognize that, globally, women comprise approximately 70 per cent of \nthe health workforce, and further recognize that women face a double \nnoncommunicable disease burden, often acting as caregivers for the sick and facing \nother structural barriers that hinder timely noncommunicable disease prevention, \nscreening, diagnosis and treatment; \n \n20. Recognize that persons with disabilities are at increased risk of \nnoncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions and often face \ndisproportionate discrimination, stigma and exclusion from accessing health services, \nand that noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions are leading causes \nof years lived with a disability; \n \n21. Recognize also that the poorest, the socioeconomically disadvantaged and \nthose in vulnerable situations, including those in conflict, emergency and \nhumanitarian settings, and those living in areas most vulnerable to climate change, \noften bear a disproportionate burden of noncommunicable diseases and mental health \nconditions, that there are unique vulnerabilities for people living in developing \ncountries, including in small island developing States, where noncommunicable \ndiseases are increasingly becoming the main cause of mortality, and that small island \ndeveloping States have among the highest rates of obesity worldwide and are \ndisproportionately represented among the countries with the highest risk of dying \nprematurely from noncommunicable diseases; \n \n22. Recognize further that, since the adoption of the political declaration in \n2018, issues such as the coronavirus disease (COVID\u201119) pandemic, humanitarian \nemergencies, natural disasters and extreme weather events, conflicts, increasing debt \nchallenges and other intersected crises have strained macroeconomic conditions and \nfiscal capacity, especially for developing countries, and directly impacted health and \nwell-being and introduced additional pressures on national responses to \nnoncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions; \n \n23. Recognize that the COVID\u201119 pandemic disproportionately impacted \npeople living with noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions and that \nmany health systems were heavily disrupted and not adequately prepared to \neffectively respond to these conditions during the pandemic, demonstrating the \nimportance of investing in resilient health systems and healthy populations; \n \n24. Recognize the threat and challenge posed by antimicrobial resistance in \nthe treatment of certain noncommunicable diseases, such as cancers, cardiovascular \ndiseases, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, and the need for integrated \npolicies and strategies that promote disease prevention and safeguard the reliable \naccess, stewardship and effectiveness of antimicrobials across health systems \naligning, as appropriate, with the global action plan on antimicrobial resistance; 10 \n \n25. Recognize that achieving universal health coverage is essential for the \nprevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, including through integrated, \nsustainable, resilient and well-financed health systems for health promotion, \n_______________ \n \n10 World Health Organization, document WHA68/2015/REC/1, annex 3. \n\nPolitical declaration of the fourth high-level meeting of the \nGeneral Assembly on the prevention and control of noncommunicable \ndiseases and the promotion of mental health and well-being \nA/RES/80/117\n \n5/14\n25-20712 \n \nprevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, care and rehabilitation for people living \nwith, or at elevated risk of, noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions, \nfocusing on a primary health care approach, while recognizing the importance of well-\nfunctioning referral systems, to connect primary health care with secondary and \ntertiary health care for conditions that require specialized services; \n \n26. Recognize further the fundamental role of primary health care in achieving \nuniversal health coverage, as was declared in the Declaration of Alma-Ata of 1978 \nand the Declaration of Astana on primary health care of 2018, and further reaffirm the \nimportance of primary health care as an effective and efficient approach to enhancing \npeople\u2019s physical and mental health, as well as social well-being, noting the need to \nunite efforts through the global coalition on primary health care to take coordinated \naction in delivering high-quality, safe, integrated and accessible health services at the \nprimary care level, including in remote geographical regions or in areas difficult to \naccess; \n \n27. Reaffirm the importance of national ownership and the primary role and \nresponsibility of governments at all levels to determine their own path in responding \nto the challenge of noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions, \nunderscore the importance of pursuing whole-of-government and whole-of-society \napproaches, and acknowledge that all stakeholders, including civil society, the private \nsector and people living with noncommunicable diseases and mental health \nconditions, play a role and can contribute to creating an environment conducive to \npreventing and controlling noncommunicable diseases and promoting mental health \nand well-being, and mobilizing all available resources, as appropriate, for the \nimplementation of national responses; \n \n28. Recognize the importance of fully respecting human rights, including the \nrights of Indigenous Peoples, in line with national contexts, in the prevention and \ncontrol of noncommunicable diseases and the promotion of mental health and well-\nbeing, and ensuring that no one is left behind, including for access to services and \ncare, acknowledging that people living with and at risk of these conditions are often \nunjustly deprived of such access and may encounter discrimination and inconsiderate \ntreatment; \n \n29. Recognize also that people living with noncommunicable diseases and \nmental health conditions, their families and caregivers have unique experiences and \nhave first-hand expertise to contribute to designing, implementing and monitoring \nhealth promotion, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care (including rehabilitation \nand palliation) policies and programmes; \n \n30. Acknowledge \nthat \nthere \nare \ncost-effective \nand \nevidence-based \ninterventions for preventing, screening, diagnosing, treating and caring for people \nliving with or at elevated risk of noncommunicable diseases and mental health \nconditions, while also acknowledging that scarce resources and increasing prices of \ncertain health products and services mean that Member States must prioritize the most \naffordable and feasible interventions, which, for the most part, can be delivered at \ncommunity and primary health care level based on context-specific considerations; \n \n31. Recognize the value of high-quality research and evidence to inform \neffective and innovative prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases and \nmental health conditions, while noting with concern that access to the benefits of \nresearch and innovation, such as quality, safe, efficacious and affordable diagnostics \nand treatment, remains challenging, especially for developing countries; \n \n32. Acknowledge that investing, as appropriate, in the World Health \nOrganization \u201cbest buys\u201d aims to save close to 7 million lives, resulting in 50 million \nadditional years of healthy life, and that these outcomes can be achieved with a return \n\nA/RES/80/117 \nPolitical declaration of the fourth high-level meeting of the \nGeneral Assembly on the prevention and control of noncommunicable \ndiseases and the promotion of mental health and well-being\n \n25-20712\n6/14 \n \non investment of at least 7 United States dollars by 2030 for every dollar spent, \nresulting in more than 230 billion dollars in economic benefits between now and 2030; \n \n33. Emphasize the importance of addressing the digital divide in health, \nbetween and within countries, to facilitate access to digital health technologies to \naddress noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions and prevent the \nexacerbation of health inequities, and in this regard acknowledge the pressing need to \naddress the major impediments that countries, particularly developing countries, face \nin accessing and developing digital technologies, and highlight the importance of \nfinancing and capacity-building; \n \n34. Recognize the need to eradicate hunger and prevent all forms of \nmalnutrition \nworldwide, \nparticularly \nundernourishment, \nstunting, \nwasting, \nunderweight and overweight in children under 5 years of age and anaemia in women \nand children, particularly girls, among other micronutrient deficiencies, ensure access \nto healthy diets and reduce the burden of diet-related noncommunicable diseases in \nall age groups; \n \n35. Recognize further that breastfeeding fosters healthy growth and improves \ncognitive development and has longer-term health benefits for both child and mother \nsuch as reducing the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing \nnoncommunicable diseases later in life; \n \n36. Recognize also that obesity is driven by multiple factors, including the \nunaffordability and unavailability of healthy diets, lack of physical activity, sleep \ndeprivation and stress; \n \n37. Emphasize the need to prioritize affordable and evidenced-based actions \nto fast-track progress in the next five years that build on demonstrative successes in \ncountries and maximize return on investment, and that data and indicators are \nessential to monitor progress; \n \n38. Recognize that multimorbidity and co-occurrence with diseases, including \ninfectious, vaccine-preventable and rare diseases, increases the complexity of early \ndiagnosis and treatment of noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions; \n \n39. Recognize also that oral diseases are a major health and economic burden \nin many countries and impact people across their lifetime, causing pain, discomfort, \ndisfigurement and even death, that untreated dental caries (tooth decay) in permanent \nteeth is among the most common health conditions, and that oral diseases are largely \npreventable and caused by a range of modifiable risk factors, requiring a continuing \nfocus on social, environmental and population strategies, and can contribute to other \nnoncommunicable diseases; \n \n40. Recognize further that leadership, political commitment, action, \ncooperation and coordination beyond the health sector are important to promote and \naccelerate cost-effective, accessible and affordable population-level interventions to \npromote healthy lifestyles and to prevent noncommunicable diseases and mental \nhealth conditions; \n \nWe therefore commit to urgently: \n \n41. Fast-track efforts to accelerate progress on noncommunicable diseases and \nmental health and well-being over the next five years, focusing on tobacco and \nnicotine control, preventing and scaling up the effective treatment of cardiovascular \nrisk factors, such as hypertension, and improving mental health care, with the aim to \nreduce by one third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases and achieve \nthe following global targets by 2030: 150 million fewer people are using tobacco; \n\nPolitical declaration of the fourth high-level meeting of the \nGeneral Assembly on the prevention and control of noncommunicable \ndiseases and the promotion of mental health and well-being \nA/RES/80/117\n \n7/14\n25-20712 \n \n150 million more people have hypertension under control; and 150 million more \npeople have access to mental health care; \n \nTo deliver on our commitment to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases \nand promote mental health and well-being, and in line with our respective national \ncontexts and where appropriate, we will: \n \nCreate health-promoting environments through action across government \n \n42. Address key social, economic and environmental determinants of \nnoncommunicable diseases and mental health and the impact of economic, \ncommercial and market factors by: (a) eradicating poverty in all its forms and \ndimensions, including extreme and multidimensional poverty, eliminating hunger and \nmalnutrition and ensuring healthy lives and well-being; (b) promoting universal \naccess to quality education and supportive living and learning environments from \nchildhood to adulthood; (c) promoting and creating safe, supportive and decent \nworking conditions; (d) providing universal, comprehensive and sustainable social \nprotection and livelihood support for low-income and impoverished people; \n(e) promoting social connection and integration and addressing social exclusion and \nisolation of people living with noncommunicable diseases and mental health \nconditions, older persons, young people, persons with disabilities and those living in \nrural and underserved areas; (f) addressing air, water and soil pollution, exposure to \nhazardous chemicals, natural disasters and extreme weather events; (g) addressing \nurban planning, including sustainable transportation and urban safety, to promote \nphysical activity by increasing the number of public spaces where persons across the \nlife course can be physically active; and (h) increasing access to affordable fruits and \nvegetables and healthy diets; \n \n43. Consider introducing or increasing taxes on tobacco and alcohol to support \nhealth objectives, in line with national circumstances; \n \n44. Encourage within national and, where relevant, regional contexts, as \nappropriate, legislation and regulation, policies and actions to: \n \n(a) \nSignificantly reduce tobacco and nicotine use by: (i) implementing health \nwarnings on all tobacco and nicotine packages;
