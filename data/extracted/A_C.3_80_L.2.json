\n \n10. Recalls that any legislative or constitutional measures adopted with a view \nto countering extremist political parties, movements, ideologies and groups of a racist \nor xenophobic character, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups and similar \nextremist ideological movements, should be in conformity with the relevant \ninternational human rights obligations, in particular articles 4 and 5 of the Convention \nand articles 19 to 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; \n__________________ \n \n11  See A/80/319. \n\nA/C.3/80/L.2\n \n5/11\n25-14998 \n \n \n11. \nEncourages States to develop and implement national action plans for the \nelimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, with \na view to, inter alia, monitoring closely the phenomenon of Nazism, neo-Nazism and \nHolocaust denial, such as commemorative celebration of the Nazi regime, its allies \nand related organizations; \n \n12.

Emphasizes once more the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur that \n\u201cany commemorative celebration of the Nazi regime, its allies and related \norganizations, whether official or unofficial, should be prohibited\u201d by States, 12 also \nemphasizes that such manifestations do injustice to the memory of the countless \nvictims of the Second World War and negatively influence children and young people, \nand stresses in this regard that it is important that States take measures, in accordance \nwith international human rights law, to counteract any celebration of the Nazi SS \norganization and all its integral parts, including the Waffen SS, and that failure by \nStates to effectively address such practices is incompatible with the obligations of \nStates Members of the United Nations under its Charter; \n \n15. Expresses deep concern about increased frequency of attempts and \nactivities intended to desecrate or demolish monuments erected in remembrance of \nthose who fought against Nazism during the Second World War, as well as to \nunlawfully exhume or remove the remains of such persons, and in this regard urges \nStates to fully comply with their relevant obligations, inter alia, under article 34 of \nAdditional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949; 13 \n \n16.

Reaffirms that such acts may, in certain circumstances, be qualified as \nfalling within the scope of the Convention, that they may not be justifiable as \nexercises of freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of association and freedom of \nexpression and that they will often fall within the scope of article 20 of the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and may be subject to certain \nrestrictions, as set out in articles 19, 21 and 22 of the Covenant; \n \n22. Encourages States to take appropriate concrete measures, including \nlegislative and educational ones, in accordance with their international human rights \nobligations, in order to prevent revisionism in respect of the Second World War and \nthe denial of the crimes against humanity and war crimes committed during the \nSecond World War; \n \n23. Calls upon States to take active measures to ensure that education systems \ndevelop the necessary content to provide accurate accounts of history, as well as \npromote tolerance and other international human rights principles; \n \n24. Recalls the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur that education that \nseeks to undercut the racist effects of nationalist populism should include accurate \nand representative accounts of national history that give voice to racial and ethnic \ndiversity and that expose the untruths of those who attempt to write ethnic groups out \nof national histories and identities in order to sustain ethnonationalist myths of \nracially or ethnically \u201cpure\u201d nations;14 \n \n25 \nCondemns without reservation any denial of or attempt to deny the \nHolocaust, as well as any manifestation of religious intolerance, incitement, \nharassment or violence against persons or communities, on the basis of ethnic origin \nor religious belief; \n \n26 \nAffirms its deep commitment to the duty of remembrance, and welcomes \nthe call of the Special Rapporteur for the active preservation of those Holocaust sites \nthat served as Nazi death camps, concentration and forced labour camps and prisons, \nas well as his encouragement to States to take measures, including legislative, law \nenforcement and educational measures, to put an end to all forms of Holocaust \ndenial;15 \n \n27. Recalls the conclusions of the Special Rapporteur that revisionism and \nattempts to falsify history may, in certain circumstances, fall under the prohibition of \nhate speech under article 4 (a) of the Convention, which States are required to declare \nas offences punishable by law, 16  and that neo-Nazi recruitment attempting to \nmainstream extreme ideologies or racial, ethnic or religious hatred and intolerance \nmay fall under article 4 (b) of the Convention; \n \n28.

Stresses the need to respect the memory and that the practices described \nabove do injustice to the memory of the countless victims of crimes against humanity \ncommitted in the Second World War, in particular those committed by the SS \norganization and by those who fought against the anti-Hitler coalition and \ncollaborated with the Nazi movement, and may negatively influence children and \nyoung people, and that failure by States to effectively address such practices is \nincompatible with the obligations of States Members of the United Nations under its \nCharter, including those related to the purposes and principles of the Organization; \n \n32. Also stresses that all such practices may fuel contemporary forms of \nracism, racial discrimination, antisemitism, discrimination based on religion or belief, \nincluding Islamophobia and Christianophobia, xenophobia and related intolerance \nand contribute to the spread and multiplication of various extremist political parties, \nmovements and groups of a racist or xenophobic character, including neo-Nazis and \nskinhead groups, and in this regard calls for increased vigilance; \n \n33. Expresses concern that the human rights and democratic challenges posed \nby extremist political parties, movements and groups are universal and no country is \nimmune to them; \n \n34. Emphasizes the need to take appropriate measures necessary to counter the \npractices described above, and calls upon States and all other stakeholders to take \nmore effective measures, while fully respecting international human rights law, to \nprevent, counter and combat those phenomena and extremist movements of a racist \nor xenophobic character, which pose a real threat to democratic values, and to increase \ntheir vigilance and be proactive in strengthening their efforts to recognize and \neffectively address those challenges; \n \n35. Underlines the importance of reliable disaggregated data and statistics on \nracist and xenophobic crimes for identifying the types of offences committed, the \nprofiles of victims and of perpetrators and whether the latter are affiliated with \nextremist movements or groups, thus enhancing better understanding of the \nphenomenon, identifying effective measures to address such racist and xenophobic \ncrimes and assessing the impact of these measures, and recalls in this regard the \ncommitments made in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 17  on data, \nmonitoring and accountability, including collecting data disaggregated by \ncharacteristics relevant in national contexts; \n \n36. Encourages States to adopt further measures to support training for the \npolice and other law enforcement bodies on the ideologies of extremist political \nparties, movements and groups the advocacy of which constitutes incitement to racist \nand xenophobic violence, to strengthen their capacity to address racist and \nxenophobic crimes and prevent racial profiling practices, to fulfil their responsibility \nfor bringing to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and to combat impunity; \n \n37. Expresses deep concern about the increased number of seats occupied by \nrepresentatives of extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character in a number of \nnational and local parliaments, and emphasizes in this regard the need for all \ndemocratic political parties to base their programmes and activities on respect for \nhuman rights and freedoms, democracy, the rule of law and good governance and to \ncondemn all messages disseminating ideas that are based on racial superiority or \nhatred and that have the objective of fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial \ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; \n__________________ \n \n17  Resolution 70/1. \n\nA/C.3/80/L.2 \n \n25-14998\n8/11 \n \n \n38.

Notes with appreciation, in this regard, the call of the Special Rapporteur \nupon political leaders and parties to strongly condemn incitement to racial \ndiscrimination or xenophobia, to promote tolerance and respect and to refrain from \nforming coalitions with extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character;19 \n \n40. Welcomes the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur to continue to \ntake steps through national legislation, in accordance with international human rights \nlaw, aimed at preventing hate speech and incitement to violence, to withdraw \nsupport \u2013 financial and otherwise \u2013 from political parties and other organizations that \nengage in neo-Nazi or other hate speech and to take steps to dismantle responsible \norganizations where such hate speech aims, or can reasonably be expected, to incite \nviolence;20 \n \n41. Encourages States to improve diversity within law enforcement agencies, \nand urges them to take all appropriate measures to facilitate the filing of complaints \nabout and to impose appropriate sanctions against those within the public service \nfound to have committed racially motivated violence or to have used hate speech; \n \n42. Expresses deep concern about the increase in reported cases of racism, \nantisemitism, discrimination based on religion, belief or origin, including \nIslamophobic, Arabophobic, Afrophobic and xenophobic manifestations during sports \nevents, including those committed by extremist groups of a racist or xenophobic \ncharacter, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and calls upon States, \ninternational organizations, sports federations and other relevant stakeholders to \nstrengthen measures to address such incidents, while also welcoming the steps that \nmany States and sports federations, clubs and fan groups have taken to eliminate \nracism at sporting events, including through sport practised without discrimination of \nany kind and in the Olympic spirit, which require human understanding, tolerance, \ninclusion, fair play and solidarity; \n \n43. Recalls the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur to introduce into \nnational criminal law a provision according to which committing an offence with \nracist or xenophobic motivations or aims constitutes an aggravating circumstance, \nallowing for enhanced penalties,21 and encourages those States whose legislation does \nnot contain such provisions to consider that recommendation; \n \n44. Notes measures taken by States to prevent discrimination against, in \nparticular but not limited to, persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and \nlinguistic minorities, people of African descent, Roma, migrants, refugees and \nasylum-seekers, and to ensure their integration into society, urges States to ensure the \nfull and effective implementation of legal, policy and institutional measures \nprotecting these individuals and groups, including women and girls, and recommends \nthat States effectively guarantee to everyone, without discrimination of any kind, their \nhuman rights, including those related to safety and security, access to justice, adequate \nreparation and appropriate information about their rights, and pursue prosecution and \nadequate punishment, as appropriate, of those responsible for racist and xenophobic \ncrimes against them, including the possibility of seeking reparation or satisfaction for \ndamages suffered as a result of such crimes; \n__________________ \n \n18  A/HRC/38/53, para. 16. \n \n19  A/72/291, para. 83. \n \n20  A/HRC/38/53, para. 35 (c). \n \n21  A/69/334, para. 81. \n\nA/C.3/80/L.2\n \n9/11\n25-14998 \n \n \n45.

Reaffirms, in this regard, the particular importance of all forms of \neducation, including human rights education, as a complement to legislative \nmeasures, and calls upon States to continue to invest in education, in both \nconventional and non-conventional curricula, inter alia, in order to transform attitudes \nand counteract ideas of racial hierarchies and superiority, and counter their negative \ninfluence, and to promote the values of non-discrimination, equality and respect for \nall, as outlined by the Special Rapporteur; \n \n48.

Strongly condemns the use in educational settings of educational material \nand rhetoric that promulgate racism, discrimination, hatred and violence on the basis \nof ethnic origin, nationality, religion or belief; \n \n50. Emphasizes the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur presented at \nthe sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, in which he emphasized the \nimportance of history classes in teaching the dramatic events and human suffering \nwhich arose out of the adoption of ideologies such as Nazism and Fascism;22 \n \n51.
