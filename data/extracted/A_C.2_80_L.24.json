Committee \nAgenda item 16 (g) \nMacroeconomic policy questions: promoting investments \nfor sustainable development \n \n \n \n \n \nIraq:* draft resolution \n \n \n \n Promoting investments for sustainable development \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nReaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled \u201cTransforming \nour world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d, in which it adopted a \ncomprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative \nSustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for \nthe full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating \npoverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest \nglobal challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its \ncommitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions \u2013 \neconomic, social and environmental \u2013 in a balanced and integrated manner, and to \nbuilding upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking \nto address their unfinished business,  \n \nReaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa \nAction Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, \nwhich is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports \nand complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with \nconcrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to \naddress the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels \nfor sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity, \n \nWelcoming the convening of the Fourth International Conference on Financing \nfor Development from 30 June to 3 July 2025 in Sevilla, Spain, and reaffirming its \noutcome document, the Sevilla Commitment, endorsed by the General Assembly in \nits resolution 79/323 of 25 August 2025, which sets forth a renewed global framework \nfor financing for development, building on the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda, to \nclose with urgency the estimated annual financing gap of 4 trillion United States \ndollars, catalyse sustainable investments at scale in developing countries and reform \nthe international financial architecture through continued and strong commitment to \nmultilateralism, international cooperation and global solidarity,  \n \n \n* On behalf of the States that are members of the Group of 77 and China, taking into account also \nthe provisions of General Assembly resolution ES-10/23 of 10 May 2024. \n\nA/C.2/80/L.24 \n \n25-16745\n2/13 \n \n \nRecalling its resolutions 74/199 of 19 December 2019, 75/207 of 21 December \n2020, 76/197 of 17 December 2021, 77/155 of 14 December 2022, 78/141 of \n19 December 2023 and 79/198 of 19 December 2024,  \n \nUnderscoring that international project finance is increasingly important for \nSustainable Development Goals and climate change investment and that the strong \ngrowth performance of international project finance can be explained by favourable \nfinancing conditions, infrastructure stimulus and significant interest on the part of \nfinancial market investors to participate in projects that require multiple financiers, \nrecognizing that international project finance can enable Governments to leverage \npublic investment through private finance participation, and noting that developing \ncountries are disadvantaged in this regard and that efforts to enhance private finance \nmobilization in developing countries are particularly crucial,  \n \nExpressing concern about the findings in the World Investment Report 2024 of \nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development that international \ninvestment in sectors relevant for the Sustainable Development Goals in developing \ncountries declined in 2023 because of the downturn in international project finance, \nused for larger projects in infrastructure sectors, that project numbers in agrifood \nsystems and in water and sanitation were lower than they were in 2015 when the \nSustainable Development Goals were adopted and that investment in the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals is unequally distributed,  \n \nNoting the findings in the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change that, although global tracked climate finance has shown an \nupward trend since the Fifth Assessment Report, current global financial flows for \nadaptation, including from public and private finance sources, are insufficient for and \nconstrain implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing countries, \nand that a small proportion of global tracked climate finance was targeted to \nadaptation and an overwhelming majority to mitigation,  \n \nEmphasizing that, in 2021, the bulk of tracked climate change investments was \nconcentrated in renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects, that international \nprivate investment in climate change sectors was directed almost exclusively to \nmitigation, with only 5 per cent going to adaptation projects, and that more than \n60 per cent was invested in developed countries, where 85 per cent of projects are \npurely privately financed, whereas almost half of the projects in developing countries \nrequire some form of public sector participation, while noting that investments in \nadaptation are underreported,  \n \nNoting with concern that the progress on most of the Sustainable Development \nGoals is either moving much too slowly or has regressed below the 2015 baseline and \nthat, in the face of current multiple crises, years of sustainable development gains are \nbeing reversed, as millions of people, particularly in developing countries, have fallen \ninto poverty, hunger and malnutrition are becoming more prevalent, and humanitarian \nneeds are rising,  \n \nNoting with concern also that international investment in sectors relevant to the \nSustainable Development Goals in developing countries declined again in 2024, with \noverall investment in Sustainable Development Goal-related sectors falling by a \nquarter, and that investment in the Sustainable Development Goals is unequally \ndistributed, \n \nHighlighting that investment in developing countries in sectors relevant to the \nSustainable Development Goals dropped by 35 per cent in infrastructure, 31 per cent \nin renewable energy, 30 per cent in water and sanitation, and 19 per cent in agrifood \nsystems, with only the health sector showing modest growth from a small base,  \n\nA/C.2/80/L.24\n \n3/13\n25-16745 \n \n \nHighlighting also the fact that finance and investment support is needed not only \nfor climate change mitigation and adaptation, but is equally important in other \nSustainable Development Goal investment areas,  \n \nHighlighting further that the second highest Sustainable Development Goal \ninvestment gap is in water and sanitation, with a growing need for sustainable and \ninnovative investments in water and sanitation to ensure progress on the implementation \nof water-related goals and targets,  \n \nNoting with concern the urgent need to achieve zero hunger, end all forms of \nmalnutrition, eradicate extreme poverty and ensure rapid, inclusive and sustainable \nincome growth in developing countries by adopting the right policies and stepping up \ninvestments, research and the sharing of technology on mutually agreed terms, with \nthe achievement of all Sustainable Development Goals as the ultimate objective,  \n \nNoting with concern also that the global environment for international \ninvestment remains challenging in 2025 and that weakening growth prospects, \neconomic fracturing trends, trade and geopolitical tensions and conflicts, industrial \npolicies and supply chain diversification are reshaping foreign direct investment \npatterns, causing some multinational enterprises to adopt a cautious approach to \noverseas expansion, \n \nNoting that the crises underscore the imperative to embed long-term and risk-\ninformed thinking and sustainability into corporate and investment practices, and \nstressing that in order to respond to and recover from the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) crisis all stakeholders will have to work in tandem, at the same time, \nwhile the global fight against the pandemic and climate change has accelerated the \nmomentum of sustainability finance and investment, with the value of sustainability-\nthemed investment products in global capital markets growing to more than \n8.2 trillion dollars in 2024, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment, recognizing that the vast majority of these funds have been invested in \ndeveloped countries, leaving \ndeveloping country investment opportunities \nsignificantly lacking, and that it is critical to scale up sustainable investments in all \ncountries, especially in developing countries, including countries in special \nsituations,  \n \nReaffirming the need to build a strong domestic savings base and strengthen the \ndomestic banking sector as a foundation for developing a stronger private sector and \nbroader capital markets (bonds, insurance, equities) and attracting institutional \ninvestors, as emphasized in the Fourth International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment and its outcome document, the Sevilla Commitment,  \n \nNoting the call to promote the formalization and growth of micro-, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises and encourage their participation in international, regional \nand national markets and integration into global value chains, including through \npromoting access for all to capacity-building, digital government, and business and \nfinancial services,  \n \nEmphasizing that success in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and \nthe eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions depends on the creation of \nenabling environments at all levels, which can be supported by a reformed \ninternational financial architecture, to attract and strengthen investments towards \nactivities that promote the Goals,  \n \nRecognizing that a revitalized global partnership will facilitate an intensive \nglobal engagement in support of the implementation of all of the Goals and their \ntargets, bringing together Governments, civil society, the private sector, academia, \nthe United Nations system and other actors and mobilizing all available resources, \n\nA/C.2/80/L.24 \n \n25-16745\n4/13 \n \n \nRecalling that, in the 2030 Agenda, it was acknowledged that the implementation \nof sustainable development will depend on the active engagement of both the public \nand private sectors and other relevant international organizations, including \ninternational financial institutions and multilateral development banks,  \n \nNoting the convening of the eighth World Investment Forum of the United \nNations Conference on Trade and Development, held in Abu Dhabi from 16 to \n20 October 2023, as well as the tenth Sustainable Development Goals Investment \nFair, held in Sevilla, Spain, from 30 June to 3 July 2025, and looking ahead to the \nnext World Investment Forum, to be held in 2026, which will continue to provide a \nglobal platform for advancing sustainable investment, \n \nWelcoming the convening of the Summit of the Future on 22\u201323 September 2024 \nat the United Nations Headquarters in New York at which resolution 79/1 of \n22 September 2024 entitled \u201cThe Pact for the Future\u201d and its annexes were adopted,  \n \nNoting the work of the United Nations in the area of investments for sustainable \ndevelopment, and taking note of the World Investment Report 2025 and the SDG \nInvestment Trends Monitor of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment and the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2024, \n \nNoting also all initiatives at the global, regional and local levels that are aimed \nat scaling up the mobilization of public and private finance towards investing for the \nachievement of the 2030 Agenda in its three dimensions and deepening international \ncooperation,  \n \nNoting further the potential of impact investment for the financing of sustainable \ndevelopment in supporting national development policies, plans, priorities and needs \nin the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,  \n \nRecognizing that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require a \nshift towards long-term investment horizons, including early-stage financing, in this \nregard encouraging investors to take measures to incentivize greater long-term \ninvestment and early-stage financing, and recognizing that international public and \nprivate finance for development complemented by other innovative financing \nmechanisms, including blended finance, can play an important role in upscaling our \ncollective efforts to cover the finance needs to achieve the Sustainable Development \nGoals, \n \nNoting that, between 2020 and 2024, developing countries attracted 531 billion \ndollars in greenfield investment in the digital economy, and that South-South \ninvestment in the digital economy is growing, and that, while greenfield investment \ngrew more than fivefold in digital services, information and communications \ntechnology infrastructure investment remained far below the 62 billion dollars \nannually required to close the connectivity gap, reaching only 15 billion dollars in \n2024, \n \nUrging urgent actions to address debt sustainability problems through \nstrengthening debt crisis prevention, including through debt management and \ntransparency, finding solutions that enable countries with severe fiscal constraints and \ndebt overhangs to invest in the Sustainable Development Goals,  \n \nRecognizing that entrepreneurship can help to achieve the 2030 Agenda, \nunderlining the importance of advancing sustainable consumption and production \npatterns, and stressing the need to promote sustainable and innovative financing \nopportunities and mechanisms to unlock new capital for sustainable investment and \nupscale sustainable business models, with a special focus on micro-, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, as well as the social and solidarity economy, where \nappropriate,  \n\nA/C.2/80/L.24\n \n5/13\n25-16745 \n \n \nEmphasizing that national development efforts need to be supported by an \nenabling international economic environment, including coherent and mutually \nsupporting world trade, monetary and financial systems, and strengthened and \nenhanced global economic governance, and in this regard stressing that the likelihood \nof an increase in global foreign direct investment is further tempered by a series of \nrisk factors,  \n \nEmphasizing also that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals is not \npossible without private and public investment, including long-term foreign \ninvestment, which can be mobilized when there is an enabling environment at all \nlevels,  \n \nRecognizing the importance of corporate sustainability, including reporting on \nenvironmental, social and governance impacts, as appropriate, to help to ensure \ntransparency and accountability and avoid practices that counteract efforts to achieve \nthe Sustainable Development Goals,  \n \nReaffirming the commitment to significantly increase investments to close the \ngender gap and strengthen support for institutions in relation to gender equality and \nthe empowerment of all women and girls at the global, regional and national levels,  \n \nNoting with concern that investments critical to achieving the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals remain underfunded, and recognizing that additional public and \nprivate investment and financing at the national and international levels will be \nrequired to meet the large investment needs, associated with gaps, for achieving the \nGoals, including in quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure to support \neconomic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and \nequitable access for all,  \n \nRecognizing that international public finance, including official development \nassistance, is important to the efforts of developing countries to achieve the \nSustainable Development Goals, including through its capacity to catalyse additional \nresource mobilization from other sources, public and private, as it can support \nimproved tax collection and help to strengthen domestic enabling environments and \nbuild essential public services,  \n \nEmphasizing that the call for the contribution by the private sector to \nSustainable Development Goals financing is not a substitute for but rather an \nimportant complement to public financing,  \n \nUnderlining that, in order to support the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, both public and private finance should be sustainable and \nprovided at affordable terms,  \n \nEmphasizing the need to continue to scale up investments in climate action, \nincluding by making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse \ngas emissions and climate-resilient development, in line with the Paris Agreement, 1 \nand reiterating the need to accelerate the transfer and deployment of environmentally \nsound and low-emission technologies on mutually agreed terms, including on \nconcessional and preferential terms,  \n \nNoting with concern that global foreign direct investment flows declined by \n11 per cent in 2024, to 1.5 trillion dollars, that foreign direct investment to developing \ncountries remained flat at 867 billion dollars, with landlocked developing countries, \nleast developed countries and small island developing States experiencing a modest \ngrowth which remained concentrated in a few countries, and that the outlook for 2025 \n__________________ \n \n1 See FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21, annex. \n\nA/C.2/80/L.24 \n \n25-16745\n6/13 \n \nis negative, owing to high investor uncertainty, with international project finance \ncontinuing a multi-year decline, \n \nTaking note of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development reporting \non investment in small island developing States, least developed countries and \nlandlocked developing countries, which allows for the identification of investment \ntrends in countries in special situations, indicating the need for enhancing foreign \ndirect investment to these countries,  \n \nStressing that transparency and inclusion in the international financial, monetary \nand trading systems and solid institutions at all levels and the design and \nimplementation of policies, including capital market regulations, where appropriate, \nthat promote incentives along the investment chain, that are aligned with long-term \nperformance and sustainability indicators and that reduce volatility, are essential for \ninvestment promotion, sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and \nemployment creation that goes hand-in-hand with technical education and vocational \ntraining in developing countries, and in this regard stressing the need for further \ninternational support as well as competitive investment climates at all levels for \ndeveloping countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,  \n \nRecognizing that socially, economically and environmentally responsible, \naccountable and sustainable national and international private

some of their \ninvestment climates;  \n \n5. \nAlso notes with concern the gap in access to capital and adequate support \nservices for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular for businesses \nled by women, young entrepreneurs and persons with disabilities, and recognizes that \nfinancial markets as well as business support organizations can be powerful vehicles \nfor sustainable and inclusive economic growth and poverty alleviation, including \nwhen they support businesses that have a sustainable development impact and when \naccess to credit is inclusive across all segments of an economy;  \n \n6. \nReiterates the commitment to advance efforts to reduce structural \nconstraints, challenges, barriers and systemic inequities that hinder access by micro- ,
