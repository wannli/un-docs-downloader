million persons living with a rare disease worldwide, \nmany of whom are children, by ensuring equal opportunities to achieve their optimal \npotential development and to fully, equally and meaningfully participate in society, \n \nReaffirming the right of every human being, without distinction of any kind, to \nthe enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and to \na standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of oneself and one\u2019s family, \nincluding adequate food, safe drinking water, sanitation, clothing and housing, and to

goal, owing to a number of different barriers, such as \ninequitable access, high prices and financial hardship, in particular people who are in \nvulnerable situations, including those in developing

particular, on the health, social and economic situation of persons \nliving with a rare disease, \n \nConcerned that reaching the correct diagnosis can take over five years, that \nmany persons living with a rare disease never receive an adequate diagnosis, and that \ninsufficient screening programmes, including newborn screening, and unequal access \nto diagnostic services, infrastructure and expertise contribute to delayed diagnosis, \nwhen nearly half of genetic diseases start in childhood,  \n \nRecognizing that timely diagnosis and early access to health services can slow \ndisease

disease and their families can \nbe at greater risk of being disproportionately affected by stigma, discrimination and \nsocial exclusion, and that one of the major barriers to improving the inclusion and \nparticipation of persons living with a rare disease and their families in society is the \nlack of knowledge and expertise in the field and a lack of awareness regarding the \nissue, \n \nUnderscoring the need to address the root causes of inequality and \ndiscrimination faced by persons living with a rare disease and their families, and in \nthis regard recognizing that there is a need for policies and programmes to prevent \nand combat prejudice, to foster inclusion and to create an environment conducive to \nrespect for their rights and dignity, \n \nRecognizing that persons

quality education and lifelong learning \nopportunities without discrimination are essential for the full, equal and meaningful \nparticipation in all aspects of social, cultural, political and economic life, and \nrecognizing that, in particular, children living with a rare disease may face multiple \nchallenges in accessing quality education owing to the inaccessibility of facilities and \nnon\u2011adapted teaching methods, among others, \n \nReaffirming also that access to full and productive employment and decent work \nis also an important aspect of full, equal and meaningful participation in society and \neconomic life, and that persons living with a rare disease and their families face \nchallenges in access to, retention of and return to employment, \n \nReaffirming further the need to achieve gender equality and to empower women \nand girls, and concerned by the fact that women and girls living with a rare disease \nface more discrimination and barriers in accessing healthcare services, including \nsexual and reproductive healthcare services, and education, as well as fully, equally \nand meaningfully participating in public life, and that women and girls undertake a \ndisproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work when a member of their \nhousehold or family lives with a rare disease, and that women face more barriers in \naccessing decent work, \n\nA/RES/80/176 \nAddressing the challenges of persons living with a rare disease and \ntheir families\n \n25-20970\n4/7 \n \n \nDeeply concerned that persons living with a rare disease, especially women and \nchildren, often face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities that are \naccessible and appropriate to their needs, which has an impact on their ability to
