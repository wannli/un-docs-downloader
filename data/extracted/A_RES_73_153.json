empowerment of all women \nand girls but are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, and \nthat the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places children, in particular \nthe girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of \ndiscrimination and violence throughout their lives,  \n \nNoting with concern also that poverty, insecurity, early pregnancy and lack of \neducation are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, that \narmed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and \nthat child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the \npoorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual \neradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international \ncommunity,  \n \nRecognizing that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and \nunderreported and often coincides with impunity and lack of accountability, \nparticularly at the community level, and that the persistence of child, early and forced \nmarriage places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering \nvarious forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including marital \nrape and sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status \nof girls and adolescent girls in society, \n \nRecognizing also that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to \nthe achievement of the economic empowerment of women and their social and \neconomic development, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance \nand remain in the labour market, and that this harmful practice can impede economic \nindependence and impose direct and indirect short- and long-term costs on society, \nand recognizing further that the economic autonomy of women can expand their \noptions for leaving abusive relationships, \n \nRecognizing further that child, early and forced marriage undermines women\u2019s \nand girls\u2019 autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives and that the \nempowerment of and investment in all women and girls, as well as the strengthening \nof their voice, agency, leadership and meaningful participation in all decisions that \naffect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and \ndiscrimination, violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable \ndevelopment, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth,  \n \nBearing in mind the vital importance of birth registration for the realization of \nthe human rights of individuals, especially girls, \n \nRecognizing that men and boys should play a role as strategic partners and allies \nof women and girls and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to \ntransforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence, as \nwell as child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender \nequality and the empowerment of women and girls,  \n \nRecognizing also that families, communities and religious, traditional and \ncommunity leaders play an essential role in transforming negative social norms and \nconfronting gender inequality, and recognizing further that empowering girls, \nincluding already married girls, requires their active participation in decision-making \nprocesses and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including \nthrough women\u2019s and girls\u2019 organizations, with the active support and engagement of \ntheir parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as \nthe wider community, \n \nRecognizing further the need to support girls and women who were subjected to \nchild, early and forced marriage, as well as their children, and underscoring the \n\nA/RES/73/153 \nChild, early and forced marriage\n \n18-22209\n4/9 \n \nimportance of removing structural barriers that prevent their access to services that \nrespond to their specific needs, \n \nNoting with concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally \naffects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant \nobstacle to educational opportunities and the development of employable skills for \ngirls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing \nto pregnancy, marriage, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and that \neducational possibilities and opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of \nwomen and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active \nparticipation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-\nmaking,  \n \nNoting with concern also that, despite gains in providing access to education, \ngirls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary \neducation, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by \nnegative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal \nhygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs \nof girls, \n \nRecognizing that child, early and forced marriage remains a serious threat to \nmultiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, \nincluding but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly \nincreasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and \nnewborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, \nincluding HIV and AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, \n \nRecognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage \ncan increase during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced displacement, \narmed conflict and natural disasters because of various factors, including insecurity, \nincreased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, the misconception of providing \nprotection through marriage, gender inequality, lack of access to continuous, quality \neducation, the stigmatization of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family \nplanning services, disruption in social networks and routines, increased poverty and \nthe absence of livelihood opportunities, and that this requires increased attention, \nappropriate protection measures and coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with \nthe full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, from the early \nstages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing further the importance of \naddressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based \nviolence and exploitation in those situations, \n \nRecognizing further that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage \nand supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require \nappropriate gender- and age-sensitive protection, prevention and response measures, \nas well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, and that existing gaps in the \ncollection and use of reliable data and evidence remain a major challenge for \nprogramming and informing appropriate measures and actions, \n \n1. \nTakes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General;12 \n \n2. \nCalls upon States, with the participation of relevant stakeholders, \nincluding women and girls, men and boys, parents and other family members, \nteachers,

and literacy education, \nand lifelong learning opportunities, remote learning opportunities and childcare, as \nneeded, to be empowered, to express themselves, to participate meaningfully in all \ndecisions that affect them and to become agents of change within their communities;  \n \n9. \nFurther calls upon States to promote awareness-raising about the harmful \neffects of child, early and

\ncondone child, early and forced marriage, to empower parents and communities to \nabandon the practice and to empower all women and girls to make informed decisions \nabout their lives;  \n \n10.
