(Habitat III), 1 which, taking into \naccount that the majority of road traffic deaths and serious injuries take place in urban \nareas, gives appropriate consideration to road safety and access to safe, affordable, \naccessible and sustainable public transport and non-motorized modes of transport,  \n \nRecalling also the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety \n2021-2030, which provides a set of options and strategies for use by Governments \nand other relevant stakeholders to guide policies and actions to improve road safety,  \n \nReaffirming its commitment to the political declaration of the high-level meeting \non improving global road safety of 30 June 2022, 2 in which road safety was \nrecognized as a major public health concern and an urgent development challenge \nthat requires commitment at all levels of government,  \n \nRecalling its resolution 78/148, entitled \u201cStrengthening the links between all \nmodes of transport to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals\u201d, adopted on \n19 December 2023, by which it proclaimed the United Nations Decade of Sustainable \nTransport, beginning in 2026,  \n \nAcknowledging the importance of the Moscow Declaration adopted at the first \nGlobal Ministerial Conference on Road Safety in 2009, 3 the Brasilia Declaration \nadopted at the second Global High-level Conference on Road Safety in

safety-\nrelated targets of the 2030 Agenda, such as targets 3.6 and 11.2, and recognizing their \nimportance in enabling the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 11 \nand in catalysing action on other Goals, including on poverty eradication, gender \nequality, climate change, decent jobs, innovation and transport,  \n \nAcknowledging the fifth Global Status Report on Road Safety, released by the \nWorld Health Organization in December 2023, which provided an assessment of \nprogress made by Member States during the Decade of Action for Road Safety \n2011-2020,  \n \nNoting that, while globally there has been a reduction of 5 per cent in the number \nof deaths between 2010 and 2021, the overall target of a 50 per cent reduction of \nglobal deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents, as included in Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal target 3.6, was not achieved by 2020,  \n \nAcknowledging that, despite the slow progress between 2010 and 2021, \n35 Member States achieved reductions of 30 to 49 per cent in the number of deaths \ndue to road traffic crashes and 10 Member States4 commendably reached the 50 per \ncent target reduction in road traffic deaths during that period,  \n \nNoting with concern that, despite the strong evidence demonstrating the \neffectiveness of legislation, only 7 countries have legislation related to road safety \nthat align with best practice criteria for all five key risk factors as defined by the \nWorld Health Organization (drink driving, speeding, non-use of motorcycle helmets, \nnon-use of seat belts, and non-use of child-restraint systems) and only 16 have \nacceded to all seven of the core road safety-related United Nations legal instruments,  \n__________________ \n \n1  Resolution 71/256, annex. \n \n2

(Bolivarian Republic of). \n\nImproving global road safety \nA/RES/78/290\n \n3/6\n24-11701 \n \n \nRecognizing the tremendous global burden that road traffic crashes continue to \nplace on society in terms of both human suffering, with nearly 1.2 million preventable \ndeaths and an estimated 50 million injuries each year, and average costs to countries \nof 3 to 5 per cent of their gross domestic product, which makes road safety an urgent \npublic health and development priority,  \n \nExpressing concern that road safety remains severely underfunded through both \npublic and private financing, and that, despite the existence of a national strategy for \nroad safety in a majority of Member States, most of these are unfunded and are not \nimplemented, \n \nTaking into account the evolving nature of transport, and noting with concern \nthe challenges brought about by these changes, including an increasing number of \ndeaths among riders of powered two- and three-wheelers, electric bicycles and \nmicromobility devices, \n \nTaking into account also the needs of non-motorized transport, while \nrecognizing the impact of road traffic crashes on children and youth, and emphasizing \nthe importance of taking into account their needs and those of road users who are in \nvulnerable situations, including older persons and persons with disabilities,  \n \nTaking into account further the emerging safety challenges and increased \ndemands put on existing transport infrastructure by the growth of Internet-based \ntransport services, including ride share companies and delivery platforms,  \n \nRecognizing the important role that national and local government authorities \nplay in ensuring the implementation of the safe system approach to road safety, \nparticularly in land-use planning and enforcement,  \n \nEmphasizing the importance of road policing and the enforcement of traffic \nlaws, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where almost 90 per cent of \nglobal road casualties occur, by means of strengthening global and regional road \npolicing cooperation initiatives, to leverage the capacities of traffic police by \ninformation exchange on training, capacity-building and enforcement activities,  \n \nEmphasizing also the need for multisectoral approaches and engagement of \ndiverse actors, including businesses and industries, which can make important \ncontributions to improving road safety globally by managing road safety throughout \ntheir value chain,  \n \nCommending the World Health Organization for its leadership role in preventing \nroad traffic injury and for its role in implementing the mandate conferred upon it by \nthe General Assembly to act, in close cooperation with the United Nations regional \ncommissions, as a coordinator on road safety issues within the United Nations system, \n \nWelcoming the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Road \nSafety, with secretariat support from the Economic Commission for Europe, in \neffectively mobilizing sustained high-level commitment to road safety by advocating \nadherence to and raising awareness of the United Nations legal instruments on road \nsafety, sharing good practices, including through participation in global and regional \nconferences, and advocating for increased funds for global road safety,  \n \nCommending the United Nations regional commissions for their work in \nincreasing road safety activities and advocating increased political commitment to \nroad safety, and in working towards setting regional and national road traffic casualty \nreduction targets, in particular the work of the Economic Commission for Europe in \nelaborating global road safety-related legal instruments, including international \nconventions and agreements, technical standards, resolutions and good practice \nrecommendations, as well as in servicing 59 global and regional legal instruments \n\nA/RES/78/290 \nImproving global

the Economic Commission for \nLatin America and the Caribbean under the United Nations Development Account and \nwith the Economic Commission for Africa with support from the Special Envoy of \nthe Secretary-General for Road Safety, as well as the work of the Economic and Social \nCommission for Western Asia on prioritizing road safety to strengthen the national \nroad safety management capacity of selected countries, and commending the \ndevelopment and implementation of road traffic safety management systems for \ndifferent types of organizations, such as the extensive work of the International \nOrganization for Standardization in developing the requirements for road traffic \nsafety management systems,  \n \nRecalling the midterm milestone of the Decade of Action for Road
