high levels of obstetric fistula and other maternal morbidities, as well as \nmaternal mortality, \n \nNoting with concern that prolonged obstructed labour, which leads to obstetric \nfistula, is also a major cause of maternal mortality and other serious childbirth injuries \nto the mother, and babies who survive such traumatic births can face significant health \nchallenges, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive maternal and newborn \nhealthcare interventions, \n \nRecognizing that adolescent girls, in particular those who live in poverty or who \nare marginalized, are at particular risk of maternal death and morbidity, including \nobstetric fistula, and concerned that the leading cause of death among girls aged 15 \nto 19 in many low- and middle-income countries is complications from pregnancy \nand childbirth and that women aged 30 and older are at increased risk of developing \ncomplications and of dying during childbirth, \n \nRecognizing also that lack of access to sexual and reproductive health, \nespecially emergency obstetric, services, including in humanitarian settings, remains \namong the leading causes of obstetric fistula, leading to ill health and death for \nwomen and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, and that a dramatic \nand sustainable scaling-up of quality treatment and healthcare services, including \nhigh-quality emergency obstetric services, and of the number of trained, competent \nfistula surgeons and midwives is needed to significantly reduce maternal and newborn \nmortality and to eradicate obstetric fistula, \n \nNoting that a human rights-based approach to eliminating obstetric fistula and \nefforts to eliminate obstetric fistula should be underpinned by, inter alia, \naccountability, \nparticipation, \ntransparency, \nempowerment, \nsustainability, \nnon-discrimination and international cooperation, \n \nDeeply concerned about discrimination against and marginalization of women \nand girls, in particular those who are facing multiple and intersecting forms of \ndiscrimination, which often result in reduced access to education and nutrition, \ncompromising their physical and mental health and well-being and the enjoyment of \ntheir human rights and the opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence \ncompared with boys, and often in their being subjected to various forms of cultural, \nsocial, sexual and economic exploitation and abuse, violence and harmful practices, \nwhich can increase the risk of obstetric fistula, \n \nDeeply concerned also about the situation of women and girls living with or \nrecovering from obstetric fistula, who are often neglected and stigmatized, which may \nlead to negative effects on their mental health, resulting in depression and suicide, \nand are driven deeper into poverty and marginalization, \n \nRecognizing the need to raise awareness among men and adolescent boys and, \nin this context, to fully engage men and community leaders as strategic partners and \nallies in the efforts to address and eliminate obstetric fistula, \n \nWelcoming the contribution by Member States, the international community, the \nprivate sector and civil society to the global Campaign to End Fistula led by the \nUnited Nations Population Fund, bearing in mind that a people-centred approach to \nsocial and economic development is fundamental for protecting and empowering \nindividuals and communities, \n \nDeeply concerned that, as the global Campaign to End Fistula completes its \ntwenty-first anniversary, while some progress has been made, significant challenges \nremain that require the intensification of efforts at all levels to end obstetric fistula, \n \nDeeply concerned also about the insufficient resources for addressing obstetric \nfistula in high-burden countries, compounded by the low levels of development \n\nA/RES/79/155 \nIntensification of efforts to end obstetric fistula\n \n24-24147\n4/9 \n \nassistance for maternal and newborn health, which have declined in recent years, and \nthe substantial need for additional resources and support for the global Campaign to \nEnd Fistula and for national and regional initiatives dedicated to improving maternal \nhealth and eliminating obstetric fistula, \n \nRecalling the Secretary-General\u2019s revised Global Strategy for Women\u2019s, \nChildren\u2019s and Adolescents\u2019 Health (2016\u20132030), undertaken by a broad coalition of \npartners, in support of national plans and strategies that aim for the highest attainable \nstandards of health and well-being, physical, mental and social, at every age, ending \nmaternal and newborn mortality, which is preventable, and noting that this can \ncontribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, \n \nNoting with deep concern that, while most causes of maternal mortality and \nmorbidity are preventable, 30 years after the adoption of the Programme of Action of \nthe International Conference on Population and Development, in 1994, global \nprogress to reduce maternal mortality has stagnated or worsened in most regions, \nparticularly in Africa between 2016 and 2020, and that, for every maternal death, an \nestimated 20 to 30 women experience acute or chronic morbidities, including \nobstetric fistula, and noting in this regard that expenditures for healthcare delivery \nsystem infrastructure, in particular emergency obstetric care supported by adequate \ntransportation infrastructure, continue to fall short of what is needed to end maternal \nmorbidity by 2030, as agreed in the 2030 Agenda,  \n \nTaking note of the Pact for the Future,15 while emphasizing particular actions to \naccelerate efforts to achieve universal health coverage and the various national, \nregional and international initiatives on all the Sustainable Development Goals and \nthe global Campaign to End Fistula, including those undertaken bilaterally and \nthrough South-South cooperation, in support of national plans and strategies in \nsectors such as health, education, finance, gender equality, energy, water and \nsanitation, poverty eradication and nutrition as a way to reduce the number of \nmaternal, newborn and under-5 child deaths, \n \nTaking note also of recently reinvigorated regional initiatives aimed at \nstrengthening commitments to ending obstetric fistula as part of the broader maternal \nand newborn health, development and human rights agenda, \n \nWelcoming government ownership and leadership in new and ongoing \ncoordination related to partnerships between stakeholders at all levels to address the \nmultifaceted determinants of maternal, newborn and child health, based on their needs \nand priorities, and in this regard welcoming also the commitments to accelerating \nprogress on the health-related Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, \n \n1. \nReaffirms the commitments made by Member States to achieve the \nSustainable Development Goals by 2030, and recognizes that the efforts to end \nobstetric fistula within a decade will contribute to the achievement of the Goals by \n2030; \n \n2. \nStresses the need to address the interlinkages between poverty, lack of or \ninadequate education for women and girls, gender inequality, lack of or inadequate \naccess to healthcare services, including sexual and reproductive healthcare services, \nearly childbearing and child, early and forced marriage as root causes of obstetric \nfistula, and calls upon States, in collaboration with the international community, to \ntake accelerated action to address the situation; \n \n3. \nAlso stresses the need for comprehensive strategies at the national, \nregional and international levels to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, \nincluding the feminization of poverty, as well as to ensure economic empowerment \n__________________ \n \n15  Resolution

obstetric fistula, while addressing underlying socioeconomic inequalities, \nwhich lie at the root of these problems, as well as risk factors such as female genital \nmutilation, child, early and forced marriage and childbearing; \n \n4. \nCalls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure the right of \nwomen and girls to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, \nincluding sexual and reproductive health, and reproductive rights, in accordance with \nthe Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and \nDevelopment, the Beijing Platform for Action16 and the outcome documents of their \nreview conferences, and to develop sustainable health systems and social services, \nwith a view to ensuring universal access to such systems and services without \ndiscrimination, while paying special attention to adequate food and nutrition, water \nand sanitation, family planning information, increasing women\u2019s empowerment, \nknowledge and awareness and ensuring equitable access to high-quality appropriate \nprenatal and delivery care for the prevention of obstetric fistula and the reduction of \nhealth inequities, as well as postnatal care for the detection and early management of \nfistula cases; \n \n5. \nAlso calls upon States to achieve universal health coverage in order to ensure \nequitable coverage and timely access, by means of national plans, policies and \nprogrammes, to healthcare services, in particular to prevent obstetric fistula, and to \nprovide universal access to high-quality emergency obstetric and newborn care, \nadequately supplied birthing facilities, antenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth \nattendance, obstetric fistula treatment and family planning that are financially \naffordable, accessible and culturally sensitive, especially in rural and the most remote \nareas; \n \n6. \nFurther calls upon States to ensure the right to education of good quality \nfor women and girls, on an equal basis with men and boys, and to ensure that they \ncomplete a full course of primary education, and to renew their efforts to improve and \nexpand girls\u2019 and women\u2019s education at all levels, including at the secondary and \nhigher levels, including age-appropriate sex education, as well as vocational \neducation and technical training, in order to, inter alia, achieve gender equality, the \nempowerment of women and girls and poverty eradication; \n \n7. \nUrges States to enact and strictly enforce laws to ensure that marriage, \nincluding in rural and remote areas, is entered into only with the free and full consent \nof the intending spouses and, in addition, to enact and strictly enforce laws concerning \nthe minimum legal age of consent and the minimum age for marriage and to raise the \nminimum age for marriage, where necessary; \n \n8. \nCalls upon the international community to provide intensified technical \nand financial support, in particular to high-burden countries, to further accelerate \nprogress towards enhancing quality care to prevent and respond to childbirth injuries \nsuch as fistula, especially in fragile contexts, and to mobilize the public and private \nsectors to ensure increased, predictable, sustained and adequate funding to prevent \nchildbirth injuries and end fistula by 2030 and leave no one behind; \n \n9. \nUrges the international community to provide and enhance the necessary \nresources and capacity-building, upon the request of Member States, in order to treat \nfistula cases through surgery, leading to the reintegration of affected women and girls \ninto their communities, with appropriate psychosocial, medical and economic support \nto restore their well-being and dignity;

Calls upon States to accelerate progress to improve maternal health by \naddressing sexual and reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health in a \ncomprehensive manner, inter alia, through the provision of family planning, prenatal \ncare, skilled attendance at birth, including midwives, emergency obstetric and \nnewborn care, postnatal care and methods of prevention and treatment of sexually \ntransmitted diseases and infections, such as HIV, within strengthened healthcare \nsystems that provide universal access to affordable, equitable and high-quality \nintegrated healthcare services and include community-based preventive and clinical \ncare, towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; \n \n13. Urges the international community to address the shortage and inequitable \ndistribution of doctors, surgeons, midwives, nurses and other healthcare workers \ntrained in life-saving obstetric care, and of space and supplies, which limit the \ncapacity of most fistula centres; \n \n14. Commends the commemoration by the international community of 23 May \nas the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula and the decision to continue to use \nthe International Day each year to significantly raise awareness, intensify actions and \nmobilize support towards ending obstetric fistula; \n \n15.
