earner and caring for younger siblings, and making them \nparticularly vulnerable to poverty, violence, including physical and sexual violence, \nand discrimination, which seriously inhibits their development and violates and/or \nimpairs the full enjoyment of their human rights, \n \nDeeply concerned also about the continuing lack of recent information and \nstatistics, disaggregated by sex, on the status of children in child-headed households, \nwhich are necessary to inform appropriate policy responses by Member States and \nthe United Nations system, \n \nRecognizing that women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection and that \nthey bear a disproportionate burden of the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, \nincluding the unpaid care and domestic work related to the care of and support for \nthose living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this negatively affects girls \nby depriving them of their childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive \nan education, often resulting in their having to head households and increasing their \nvulnerability to the worst forms of child labour and to sexual exploitation, \n \nNoting with concern that millions of girls are engaged in child labour and its worst \nforms, including those who have been victims of trafficking in persons and affected by \narmed conflict and humanitarian emergencies, that children without nationality or birth \nregistration are vulnerable to trafficking in persons and child labour and that many \nchildren face the double burden of having to combine economic activities with unpaid \ncare and domestic work, which deprive them of their childhood and hamper the full \nenjoyment of their right to education and opportunities for decent employment in the \nfuture, and noting in this regard the need to recognize, reduce and redistribute girls\u2019 \ndisproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, \n \nRecognizing that girl children are often at greater risk of being exposed to and \nencountering various forms of discrimination and violence and forced labour, which, \namong other things, would hinder efforts towards the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, particularly those Goals that are relevant to gender equality and \nthe empowerment of girls, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to \nensure a just and equitable world for girls, including by partnering with men and boys, \nas an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, \n \nRecognizing also that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is \ncritical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Sustainable Development \nGoals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the \nmeaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the \ncycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and \neffective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing further that empowering \ngirls requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of \nchange in their own lives and communities, including through girls\u2019 organizations with \nthe active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care \nproviders, boys and men, as well as the wider community, \n \nDeeply concerned about all forms of violence against children, including those \nthat disproportionately affect girls, such as child prostitution, child pornography and \nother child sexual abuse material, rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence, trafficking in \npersons and the use of information and communications technology and social media \nto perpetrate violence against women and girls, and, in addition, about the \ncorresponding impunity and lack of accountability, and that violence against women \nand girls is underrecognized and underreported, particularly at the community level, \nwhich reflects discriminatory norms that reinforce the lower status of girls in society, \n \nDeeply concerned also about discrimination against the girl child and the \nviolation of the rights of the girl child, including girls with disabilities, bearing in \nmind their specific needs, which often result in less access for girls to education, and \nto quality education, nutrition, including food allocation, and physical and mental \n\nA/RES/72/154 \nThe girl child\n \n17-22960 \n4/11 \n \nhealth-care services, in girls enjoying fewer of the rights, opportunities and benefits \nof childhood and adolescence than boys, and in leaving them more vulnerable than \nboys to the consequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations and often \nbeing subjected to various forms of cultural, social, sexual and economic exploitation \nand violence, abuse, rape, incest, honour-related crimes and harmful practices, such \nas female infanticide, child, early and forced marriage, prenatal sex selection and \nfemale genital mutilation, \n \nDeeply concerned further that, despite its widespread practice, child, early and \nforced marriage is still underreported, recognizing that this requires further attention \nand that child, early and forced marriage exposes the girl child to greater risk of HIV \nand sexually transmitted infections, often leads to premature sexual relations, early \npregnancy and early childbearing and increases the risk of obstetric fistula and high \nlevels of maternal mortality and morbidity, and furthermore entails complications \nduring pregnancy and childbirth, which often lead to disability, stillbirth and maternal \ndeath, particularly for young women and girls, which require appropriate prenatal and \npostnatal health-care services for mothers, including in the area of skilled birth \nattendance and emergency obstetric care, and noting with concern that this reduces \ngirls\u2019 opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, \nparticipate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-\nterm adverse impact on their physical and mental health and well-being, their \nemployment opportunities and their quality of life and that of their children, and \nviolates and/or impairs the full enjoyment of their human rights, \n \nDeeply concerned that young women and girls are particularly affected by water \nscarcity, unsafe water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene, and concerned \nfurthermore that girls, especially those in rural areas, are often excluded from full and \ncontinued participation in school owing to their burden of water procurement at home, \na lack of water and sanitation facilities in schools and inadequate access to effective \nfeminine hygiene products, \n \nEmphasizing that increased and equal access to quality education for young \npeople, especially adolescent girls, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive \nhealth, as well as health care, hygiene and sanitation, dramatically lowers their \nvulnerability to preventable diseases and infections, in particular HIV and other \nsexually transmitted infections, \n \nRecognizing that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still \nmore likely than boys to remain excluded from education, and recognizing also that \namong gendered barriers to girls\u2019 equal enjoyment of their right to education are child \nmarriage, early pregnancy, gender-based violence, the disproportionate share of \nunpaid care and domestic work and gender stereotypes and negative social norms that \nlead families and communities to place less value on girls\u2019 education when compared \nwith that of boys, \n \nDeeply concerned that school-related violence against girls, including sexual \nviolence and harassment on the way to and from and at school, such as violence \nperpetrated by teachers, continues to deter girls\u2019 education and, in many cases, the \ntransition to and completion of secondary education, and that these risks may \ninfluence parents\u2019 decision to allow girls to attend school, \n \nNoting that school meals and take-home rations attract and retain children in \nschools, and recognizing that school feeding is an incentive to enhance enrolment and \nreduce absenteeism, especially for girls, \n \nStressing the need for the international community, the relevant United Nations \nentities, the specialized agencies, civil society and international financial institutions \nto continue to actively support, through the allocation of enhanced financial resources \nand technical assistance, targeted comprehensive programmes that address the needs \nand priorities of the girl child, \n\nThe girl child \nA/RES/72/154\n \n5/11 \n17-22960 \n \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General;18 \n \n2. \nStresses the need for the full and urgent implementation of the rights of \nthe child, including the girl child, as provided under international human rights \ninstruments, and urges States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the \nConvention on the Rights of the Child,1 the Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Discrimination against Women,2 the Convention on the Rights of Persons \nwith Disabilities3 and the Optional Protocols thereto4 as a matter of priority; \n \n3. \nUrges all States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Minimum Age \nConvention, 1973 (No. 138),19 and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 \n(No. 182),20 of the International Labour Organization to consider doing so;  \n \n4. \nUrges States to develop or review relevant programmes that promote \ngender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and equal access to \nbasic social services, such as education, nutrition, water and sanitation, birth \nregistration, health care, vaccinations and protection from diseases representing the \nmajor causes of mortality, including non-communicable diseases, and to mainstream \na gender perspective into all development policies and programmes, including those \nspecific to the girl child;  \n \n5. \nAlso urges States to improve the situation of girl children living in poverty, \nincluding extreme poverty, deprived of adequate food and nutrition, water and \nsanitation facilities, with limited or no access to basic physical and mental health-\ncare services, shelter, education, participation and protection; \n \n6. \nRecognizes that ensuring equal access to inclusive, equitable and quality \neducation requires transformations in education systems, mainstreaming a gender \nperspective into educational programmes, infrastructure development and teacher \ntraining, and in this regard calls upon States to invest in quality education, including \nthrough adequate financing, to ensure that all girls, including those who are \nmarginalized or in vulnerable situations, enjoy their right to education; \n \n7. \nNotes the role of the United Nations in supporting national Governments \nin the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 21 and in \nrealizing girls\u2019 right to education; \n \n8. \nCalls upon States to recognize the right to education on the basis of equal \nopportunity and non-discrimination by making primary education compulsory and \navailable free to all children, including those living in rural areas, and ensuring that \nall children have equal access to quality education, as well as making secondary and \ntertiary education available and accessible to all, in particular through the \nprogressive introduction of free secondary education, bearing in mind that special \nmeasures to ensure equal access, including affirmative action, ensuring physical \naccess to education, including by increasing financial incentives to families, \nimproving the safety of girls on the way to and from school, ensuring that all schools \nare accessible, safe, secure and free from violence and providing hygienic, separate \nand adequate sanitation facilities, contribute to achieving equal opportunity and \ncombating exclusion and ensuring school attendance, in particular for girls and \nchildren from low-income families and children who become heads of households; \n \n9. \nCalls upon all States to place enhanced emphasis on quality education for \nthe girl child, including catch-up and literacy education for those who did not receive \nformal education, special initiatives for keeping girls in school through post-primary \neducation, including those who are already married or pregnant, to promote access to \nskills and entrepreneurship training for young women and to tackle gender \n__________________ \n \n18

mathematics, including information and communications technology, \nthroughout their education, by, inter alia, expanding the scope of education and training \nopportunities ranging from basic digital fluency to advanced technical skills, \nrecognizing that girls who develop such skills may enjoy more academic success and \nhigher-paying jobs in the future, and recognizing also that girls and women have an \nequally important role to play in these arenas as men and boys;  \n \n11. \nCalls upon States, with the support, where appropriate, of international \norganizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, to develop policies \nand programmes, giving priority to formal, informal and non-formal education \nprogrammes, including scientifically accurate and age-appropriate comprehensive \neducation, relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and \nyoung women and men in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, \nand with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, with \ninformation on sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention, gender equality \nand women\u2019s empowerment, human

reduction \nskills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, \nparents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to, \ninter alia, enable them to protect themselves from HIV infection and other risks; \n \n12. Urges States to acknowledge the different needs of girls and boys during \ntheir childhood and adolescence and, as appropriate, to make adapted investments \nthat are consistent with and responsive to their changing needs, in particular ensuring \nthat girls have access to clean water, including safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene \nand feminine hygiene products as well as private toilet facilities, including feminine \nhygiene product disposal facilities, in educational institutions and other public spaces, \nwhich will improve their health and access to education and increase their safety;  \n \n13. \nCalls upon States, in collaboration with civil society and other relevant \nactors, to promote educational and health practices in order to foster a culture in which \nmenstruation is recognized as healthy and natural, and girls are not stigmatized on this \nbasis, recognizing that girls\u2019 attendance at school can be affected by negative \nperceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such \nas water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs of girls; \n \n14. Urges States to strengthen efforts to urgently eradicate all forms of \ndiscrimination against women and girls, and calls upon all States, the United Nations \nsystem and civil society to take measures to address the obstacles that continue to \naffect the achievement of the goals set forth in the Beijing Platform for Action, 9 as \ncontained in paragraph 33 of the further actions and initiatives, 22 including reviewing \nremaining laws that discriminate against women and girls in order to modify or \nabolish them and, where appropriate, strengthening national mechanisms to \nimplement inclusive policies and programmes for the girl child and, in some cases, to \nenhance coordination among responsible institutions for the realization of the human \nrights of girls, including access to justice, fighting impunity for perpetrators of and \nensuring the availability of appropriate penalties for crimes of sexual violence \ncommitted against the girl child, and to mobilize all necessary resources and support \nin order to achieve those goals;  \n__________________ \n \n22 Resolution S-23/3, annex. \n\nThe girl child \nA/RES/72/154\n \n7/11 \n17-22960 \n \n \n15.
