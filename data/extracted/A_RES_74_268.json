The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link \nbetween the illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed \nconflict as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecognizing that the trade in conflict diamonds continues to be a matter of \nserious international concern, which can be directly linked to the fuelling of armed

States by the Charter of the United Nations regarding the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, and recognizing that continued \naction to curb the trade in conflict diamonds is imperative,  \n \nNoting with appreciation that the Kimberley Process, as an international \ninitiative led by Participants, has pursued its deliberations on an inclusive basis \ninvolving concerned stakeholders, including producing, exporting and importing \nStates, the diamond industry and civil society, as well as applicant States and \ninternational organizations,  \n \nWelcoming the

in developing countries,  \n \nNoting that, while the vast majority of rough diamonds produced in the world \nare from legitimate sources, the elimination of conflict diamonds from legitimate \ntrade is the primary objective of the Kimberley Process, and stressing the need to \ncontinue its activities in order to achieve this objective,  \n \nRecognizing that the Kimberley Process promotes legitimate rough diamond \ntrade, and recalling the positive benefits of legitimate diamond trade to producing \ncountries, including its transparency and accountability throughout the diamond \nindustry, and the contribution it has made to the economies of producing, exporting \nand importing States, and therefore underlining the need for continued international \naction with regard to the ethical exploitation, sale and trade of rough diamonds,  \n \nWelcoming the efforts to enhance regional cooperation on Kimberley Process \nmatters among artisanal and alluvial diamond-producing countries in Central Africa \nand the Mano River Union facing similar challenges, and further encouraging the \nsharing of lessons with partners in the region and outside,  \n \nAcknowledging the successful role that the Kimberley Process has played, in the \nlast 17 years, in stemming the flow of conflict diamonds and the valuable \ndevelopment impact it has had in improving the lives of many

the implementation of the Kimberley Process \nCertification Scheme2 continues to have a positive impact in reducing the opportunity \nfor conflict diamonds to play a role in fuelling armed conflict and helps to protect \nlegitimate trade and ensure the effective implementation of the relevant resolutions \non trade in conflict diamonds,  \n \nRecognizing that regular review and reform of the Kimberley Process will be \nnecessary to keep pace with and aim to address the ongoing threat of instability, \nconflict and contemporary challenges in the diamond trade, as well as to seize \ncontemporary opportunities,  \n \nWelcoming the decision of the 55 Kimberley Process Participants, representing \n82 countries, including the 27 States members of the European Union and the United

particularly smaller producers, and not to hinder \nthe development of the diamond industry,  \n \nRecognizing also that the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which came \ninto effect on 1 January 2003, will be credible only if all Participants have the \nrequisite national legislation coupled with effective and credible internal systems of \ncontrol designed to eliminate the presence of conflict diamonds in the chain of \nproducing, exporting and importing rough diamonds within their own territories and \nacross their borders, while taking into account that differences in
