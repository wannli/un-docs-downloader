progress seen in global malaria control between \n2000 and 2015, during which period mortality decreased in South-East Asia by 44 per \ncent, in Africa by 37 per cent and in the Americas by 27 per cent, but noting with \nconcern the trend, in recent years, of stalling mortality rates in some countries, in \nparticular those with a high burden of malaria, and that the global malaria community \nneeds to increase its focus on supporting countries where malaria elimination will be \nhardest,  \n \nRecognizing that continued scale-up of integrated community case management \nof malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea in children under 5 years of age in the highest \nburden countries, and a strengthening of integrated delivery systems for malaria \nprevention tools, would be a cost-effective solution to help in bridging systems gaps \nuntil health systems are further strengthened,9 while also helping to reach populations \nat highest risk of malaria,  \n \nRecalling that the target for malaria reduction under Millennium Development \nGoal 6 had been achieved, with the incidence rate decreasing by 18 per cent globally, \nfrom 76 to 63 cases per 1,000 population at risk, between 2000

in developing countries, \nparticularly in Africa, by 2030\n \n20-11861\n4/13 \n \n \nRecognizing the important gains in reversing the malaria burden in Africa, \nincluding a 42 per cent decline in malaria case incidence and a 66 per cent decline in \nmalaria death rates between 2000 and 2015,10  \n \nAcknowledging the progress made in parts of Africa in reversing the high burden \nof malaria through political engagement and sustainable national malaria control \nprogrammes, as well as the success achieved in respect of the 2015 goals concerning \nmalaria control set by the World Health Assembly, the RBM Partnership to End \nMalaria and the Abuja Declaration on Roll Back Malaria in Africa, 8 \n \nAcknowledging also the progress made in Latin America in reducing the \nincidence of malaria, with 15 out of 21 countries reducing the incidence by 75 per \ncent by 2015, and in significantly decreasing the number of malaria deaths by 79 per \ncent since 2000, owing to the commitment of countries to improving access to \nmedicines and health services and to sustained efforts in prevention programmes,  \n \nRecognizing that, despite the fact that increased global and national investments \nin malaria control have yielded significant results in decreasing the burden of malaria \nin many countries, and that some countries are moving towards the elimination of \nmalaria, many countries continue to have unacceptably high burdens of malaria and, \nin order to reach the internationally agreed development goals, including the \nSustainable Development Goals, must rapidly increase malaria prevention and control \nefforts, which rely heavily on medicines and insecticides whose utility is continuously \nthreatened by the development of resistance to antimalarial agents, as well as \nresistance of mosquitoes to insecticides and their shift to outdoor biting and resting,  \n \nAware that recent successes in prevention and control are fragile and can be \nmaintained only with sufficient and sustained national and international investment \nto fund global malaria control efforts fully,  \n \nRegretting the high number of people still without access to medicines, and \nunderscoring that improving access to medicines could save millions of lives every \nyear,  \n \nRecognizing the serious challenges relating to substandard and falsified medical \nproducts, poor malaria diagnostics and poor quality of vector control products,  \n \nExpressing concern about the continued morbidity, mortality and debility \nattributed to malaria, and recalling that more efforts are needed as countries implement \nthe Sustainable Development Goals and focus on targets set out in the Global Technical \nStrategy for Malaria 2016\u20132030 and the Action and Investment to Defeat Malaria \n2016\u20132030 plan to reduce malaria mortality rates by 90 per cent by 2030, \n \nAware that a concerted and coordinated global effort will be needed to \nsubstantially reduce malaria transmission, morbidity and mortality by 2030 and \nachieve the targets set in the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016\u20132030,  \n \nRecognizing that progress can be accelerated through a multi-pronged response \nby expanding currently available life-saving interventions, making malaria a higher \npolitical priority and considering malaria control as an integrated part of the health \nsystem, increasing accountability, strengthening regional and cross-border \ncollaboration, and ensuring that the development and use of new tools and approaches \nare maximized,  \n \nGravely concerned about the health burden of malaria worldwide, with \n228 million cases and 405,000 deaths reported in 2018 alone, 11 in particular in \n__________________ \n \n10  See World Health Organization, World Malaria Report 2016.  \n \n11  See World Health Organization, World Malaria Report 2019.  \n\nConsolidating gains and accelerating efforts to control  \nand eliminate malaria in developing countries,  \nparticularly in Africa, by 2030 \nA/RES/74/305\n \n5/13\n20-11861 \n \nsub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 94 per cent of the deaths occur, affecting \nmostly young children,  \n \nTaking note of the World Malaria Report 2019, which highlights, among other \nthings, the need to increase the coverage of malaria interventions for pregnant women \nand children in Africa, and that the amount invested for malaria control and elimination \nefforts in 2018 fell short of the 5 billion dollars estimated to be required globally to \nstay on track towards the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016\u20132030 milestones, \n \nGravely concerned that globally, children account for nearly 70 per cent of \nmalaria-related deaths each year, and noting that in 2018, an estimated 11 million \npregnant women were infected with malaria in areas of moderate and high disease \ntransmission in sub-Saharan Africa (about 29 per cent of all pregnancies in the region) \nand as a result, nearly 900,000 children were born with a low birthweight \u2013 a leading \ncause of child mortality,11 \n \nAcknowledging the \u201cHigh burden to high impact\u201d initiative as a country-led \napproach to reignite the pace of progress and get back on track to achieve the targets \nof the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016\u20132030 in high-burden countries, \n \nGravely concerned about the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic on health systems and malaria, with a World Health Organization modelling \nanalysis predicting a possibility of malaria deaths doubling in 2020 in sub-Saharan \nAfrica as a result of severe disruptions to insecticide-treated net campaigns and a lack \nof access to antimalarial medicines, \n \nWelcoming the guidance issued by the World Health Organization regarding \nsupport to countries in their efforts to safely maintain malaria services during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, including the RBM partnership to End Malaria operational \nsupport to countries aimed at sustaining the planned campaigns for long-lasting \ninsecticidal nets, seasonal malaria chemoprevention and indoor residual spraying \nwhile practising social distancing for COVID-19, and addressing stock-outs and \nbottlenecks relating to case management, \n \nEmphasizing the importance of strengthening health systems to effectively \nsustain malaria control and elimination efforts, recognizing the existing opportunities \nto control the vector-borne diseases and to further advance progress towards the \nSustainable Development Goals (target 3.3) by incorporating an integrated approach \nin delivering health services for prevention and eliminating the transmission of \nmalaria and neglected tropical diseases, and enable appropriate responses to other \nhealth issues and emergencies, including investment in entomology and vector control \nfor human resources and infrastructures,  \n \nRecognizing the critical need to strengthen malaria surveillance and data quality \nin all regions where malaria is endemic in order to accurately measure progress, \ncombat resurgence and target resources, particularly in the face of growing resistance \nto treatment and preventive measures, and recognizing also that additional financing \nis needed to strengthen national and regional surveillance systems and to support the \nsharing and analysis of best practices to address urgent programmatic challenges, \nimprove monitoring and evaluation, and conduct regular financial planning and gap \nanalyses,  \n \nAcknowledging that the expansion of malaria interventions can be used as an \nentry point for strengthening health systems more broadly, including maternal and \nchild health services and laboratory services, and for building stronger health \ninformation and disease surveillance systems, which will further support the effective \ncase management of malaria,  \n\nA/RES/74/305 \nConsolidating gains and accelerating efforts to control \nand eliminate malaria in developing countries, \nparticularly in Africa, by 2030\n \n20-11861\n6/13 \n \n \nCommending the efforts of the World Health Organization, the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund, the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Bank and other partners to fight malaria \nover the years,  \n \nNoting that the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is a \nprimary multilateral funder for malaria control and elimination and that continued \nprogress on malaria elimination will rely on, among other things, the successful \nreplenishment of the Global Fund and continued prioritization of malaria at the \ncountry level to sustain and scale up malaria interventions to achieve the 2030 targets,  \n \nNoting also that existing bilateral donors have made a significant contribution \nto the progress on malaria control and elimination, and recognizing the need for other \ndonor countries to increase their investments, including official development \nassistance, in anti-malaria efforts,  \n \nRecognizing the commitment of countries in which malaria is endemic to fight \nthe disease, and recognizing also the need for those countries to further increase the \ndomestic resources they make available to combat the disease,  \n \n1. \nWelcomes the report of the World Health Organization transmitted by the \nSecretary-General,12 and calls for support for the implementation of the \nrecommendations contained therein;  \n \n2. \nCalls for increased support for the implementation of international \ncommitments and goals pertaining to the fight against malaria, including Goal 3, \ntarget 3.3, of the Sustainable Development Goals,1 as well as the related targets \noutlined in the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016\u20132030 of the World Health \nOrganization;6 \n \n3. \nEncourages malaria-endemic countries to increase the domestic resources \nthey make available to combat the disease and to review and strengthen national \nstrategic plans in line with technical recommendations of the World Health \nOrganization and embed those firmly in national health sector and development plans;  \n \n4. \nAlso encourages malaria-endemic countries to adopt a multisectoral \napproach to malaria control, taking a whole-of-government approach to fully address \nits social, environmental and economic determinants and building on synergies with \nother development priorities, including progressively achieving universal health \ncoverage, and recognizes that the roll-out of End Malaria councils and funds in \nseveral countries provides one example of how countries are operationalizing this \napproach; \n \n5. \nFurther encourages malaria-endemic countries to scale up coverage of \nmalaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment, leverage existing channels for integrated \nservice delivery where possible and strengthen systems to respond to the needs of \nlocal communities;  \n \n6. \nCalls upon Member States, with the support of development partners, to \nprovide universal access to existing life-saving tools for the prevention, diagnosis and \ntreatment of malaria, in particular to the package of core interventions recommended \nby the World Health Organization,13 and to ensure equity in access to health-care \nservices for all people at risk of contracting malaria, especially for those who are \n__________________ \n \n12  A/74/792.  \n \n13  The package of core interventions, including quality-assured vector control, chemoprevention and \ndiagnostic testing and treatment, can dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality (see para. 36 \nof the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016\u20132030).  \n\nConsolidating gains and accelerating efforts to control  \nand eliminate malaria in developing countries,  \nparticularly in Africa, by 2030 \nA/RES/74/305\n

organizations of the United Nations \nsystem, international institutions, non-governmental organizations, the private sector \nand civil society to continue to observe World Malaria Day on 25 April, in order to \nraise public awareness of and knowledge about the prevention, control and treatment \nof malaria as well as the importance of meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, \nand stresses the importance of engaging local communities in this regard;  \n \n8. \nAcknowledges the urgent need to optimize existing health financing in \ngeneral, including support for malaria control through the use of surveillance to \nincrease programmatic impact and efficiency, while also recognizing that funding \nshould increase substantially if the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016\u20132030 \nmilestone for 2020 of 6.4 billion United States dollars per year is to be achieved;  \n \n9. \nAlso acknowledges the commitments of financial support provided \nthrough multilateral and bilateral channels, and recognizes the need for a substantial \nincrease in financial support to meet the targets of the Global Technical Strategy for \nMalaria 2016\u20132030, from an annual investment of 3.1 billion dollars in 2017 to \n8.7 billion dollars by 2030;6 \n \n10. Welcomes the commitments of financial support, while recognizing the \nneed for additional funding to achieve malaria elimination targets, for malaria \ninterventions and for research and development of preventive, diagnostic and control \ntools from the international community, through funding from multilateral and \nbilateral sources and from the private sector, as well as by making predictable \nfinancing available through appropriate and effective aid modalities and in-country \nhealth financing mechanisms aligned with national priorities, which are key to \nstrengthening health systems, including malaria surveillance, and promoting \nuniversal and equitable access to high-quality malaria prevention, diagnostic and \ntreatment services, and noting in this regard that a high level of external assistance \nper person at risk of contracting malaria is associated with a decrease in the incidence \nof the disease;  \n \n11. \nUrges the international community, United Nations agencies and private \norganizations and foundations to support the implementation of the Global Technical \nStrategy for Malaria 2016\u20132030, including through support for the complementary \nAction and Investment to Defeat Malaria 2016\u20132030 plan and for programmes and \nactivities at the country level in order to achieve internationally agreed targets on \nmalaria;  \n \n12. Calls upon the international community to continue to support the RBM \nPartnership to End Malaria and partner organizations, including the World Health \nOrganization, the World Bank and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, as vital \ncomplementary sources of support for the efforts of malaria-endemic countries to \ncombat the disease;  \n \n13. Urges the international community to work in a spirit of cooperation \ntowards effective, increased, harmonized, predictable and sustained bilateral and \nmultilateral assistance and research to combat malaria, including support for the \nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, in order to assist States, in \nparticular malaria-endemic countries, to implement sound national plans, in particular \nhealth plans and sanitation plans, including malaria control and elimination strategies \n__________________ \n \n14  The call in the Global Malaria Programme of the World Health Organization for universal access \nto prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and for equity in access to services, are also key pillars of \nits Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016\u20132030. \n\nA/RES/74/305 \nConsolidating gains and accelerating efforts to control \nand eliminate malaria in developing countries, \nparticularly in Africa, by 2030\n \n20-11861\n8/13 \n \nwhich may include evidence-based, cost-effective and context-appropriate \nenvironmental management solutions, and integrated management of childhood \nillnesses, in a sustained and equitable way that, inter alia, contributes to strengthening \nhealth system development approaches at the district level;  \n \n14. Calls upon the international community to assist malaria-endemic \ncountries to strengthen their health systems, medicine production and human \nresources for health to achieve universal health coverage; \n \n15. Appeals to the malaria partners to resolve the financial, supply chain and \ndelivery bottlenecks that are responsible for stock-outs of long-lasting insecticidal \nnets, insecticides for indoor residual spraying, rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin-\nbased combination therapies at the national level, whenever they occur, including \nthrough the strengthening of malaria programme management at the country level;  \n \n16. Welcomes the contribution to the mobilization of additional and \npredictable resources for development by voluntary innovative financing initiatives \ntaken by groups of Member States, and in this regard notes the contributions of the \nInternational Drug Purchase Facility, UNITAID, the International Finance Facility for \nImmunization, the advance market commitments for vaccines and Gavi, the Vaccine \nAlliance, and expresses support for the work of the Leading Group on Innovative \nFinancing for Development and its special task force on innovative financing for \nhealth;  \n \n17. Urges malaria-endemic countries to work towards financial sustainability, \nto increase national resources allocated to malaria control and to create favourable \nconditions for working with the private sector in order to improve access to good-\nquality malaria services, as well as to build on synergies with other development \npriorities, including the strengthening of health systems and engagement with \ndevelopment partners on implementing an effective vector control response, 15 as a \ncontribution to the achievement of universal health coverage;  \n \n18. Urges Member States to assess and respond to the needs for integrated \nhuman resources at all levels of the health system in order to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, to take action, as appropriate, to effectively govern the \nrecruitment, training and retention of skilled health personnel, and to give particular \nfocus to the availability of skilled personnel at all levels to meet technical and \noperational needs as increased funding for malaria control programmes becomes \navailable;  \n \n19. Stresses the importance of improved community-based systems to control \nmalaria, bearing in mind that families are often the starting point for effective health \ncare for a child with a fever, and encourages malaria-endemic countries to extend the \nreach of public health services by training and deploying community health workers, \nparticularly in rural and remote areas, and to expand integrated community case \nmanagement of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea, with a focus on children under \n5 years of age;6 \n \n20. Affirms that close collaboration with community leaders and implementing \npartners, including non-governmental organizations, health workers and volunteers, \nis an essential factor for success in combating malaria, and calls upon Member States \nto introduce integrated, people-centred community services, in coordination with \nhealth-care providers in the public and private sectors, and to continue efforts to \ncollaborate with non-governmental partners, health workers and volunteers in \nimplementing community-based approaches to reach populations in remote and hard-\nto-reach areas;6 \n__________________ \n \n15  See A/72/822, para. 44.  \n\nConsolidating gains and accelerating efforts to control  \nand eliminate malaria in developing countries,  \nparticularly in Africa, by 2030 \nA/RES/74/305\n \n9/13\n20-11861 \n \n \n21. Calls upon Member States to promote access to medicines, and \nemphasizes that access to affordable and quality medicines and medical care in the \nevent of sickness, as well as in the prevention, treatment and control of diseases, is \ncentral to the realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable \nstandard of physical and mental health;  \n \n22. Urges the international community, inter alia, to support the work of the \nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to enable it to meet its financial \nneeds and, through country-led initiatives with adequate international support, to \nintensify access to affordable, safe and effective antimalarial treatments, including \nartemisinin-based combination therapies, intermittent preventive therapies for \npregnant women, children under 5 and infants, adequate diagnostic facilities, long-\nlasting insecticidal nets, including, where appropriate, through the free distribution \nof such nets and, where appropriate, to insecticides for indoor residual spraying for \nmalaria control, taking into account relevant international rules, including the \nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants16 standards and guidelines; \n \n23. Urges relevant international organizations, in particular the World Health \nOrganization and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, to enhance the assistance \nefforts of national Governments to provide universal access to malaria control \ninterventions to address all at-risk populations, in particular children and pregnant \nwomen, in malaria-endemic countries, particularly in Africa, as rapidly as possible, \nwith due regard to ensuring the proper use of those interventions, including long-\nlasting insecticidal nets, and sustainability through full community participation and \nimplementation through the health system;  \n \n24. Calls upon Member States, in particular malaria-endemic countries, with \nthe support of the international community, to establish and/or strengthen national \npolicies, operational plans and research, with a view to scaling up efforts to achieve \ninternationally agreed malaria targets, in accordance with the technical \nrecommendations of the World Health Organization;  \n \n25.
