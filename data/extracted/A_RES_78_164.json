development can contribute to the eradication of \npoverty and that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development therefore \nhas an important role to play in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda,  \n \nRecognizing also that the feminization of poverty persists and that the \neradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is \nan indispensable requirement for women\u2019s economic empowerment and sustainable \ndevelopment, and acknowledging the mutually reinforcing links between the \nachievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and the \neradication of poverty,  \n \nConcerned that the global economy is still facing difficult macroeconomic \nconditions and that, in recent years, poverty reduction has continued to stagnate in \ndeveloping countries, owing to, inter alia, the global economic slowdown, conflicts \nand the vulnerability of States to climate change and disasters, noting the heightened \ninternational policy uncertainty with regard to trade and weaker global growth and \nthat per capita gross domestic product growth in many regions is significantly below \nthe rates needed to eradicate poverty, and reiterating that those left behind are \nbecoming increasingly harder to reach, especially those living in rural areas

no one behind and to \nendeavour to reach those furthest behind first much more difficult to achieve, with \napproximately 691 million people estimated to live in extreme poverty in 2023, with \nslower recovery to pre-pandemic trend paths projected in developing countries and \nwith the drop in per capita incomes having a particularly adverse impact on low-\nincome households, jeopardizing decades of progress in reducing extreme poverty \nand exacerbating already high levels of inequality, recognizing that, despite massive \n__________________ \n \n7  Resolution 69/283, annex II.

dollars in cumulative output \nlosses during 2020 and 2021 may erase nearly all output gains of the previous four \nyears, and that COVID-19 has laid bare the immense challenges facing the world, \nranging from inadequate health infrastructure to the lack of universal basic social \nprotection, making the implementation of the Third United Nations Decade for the \nEradication of Poverty (2018\u20132027) especially challenging,  \n \nUnderlining that the Third United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty \n(2018\u20132027), on the theme \u201cAccelerating global actions for a world without poverty\u201d, \nis important for maintaining the momentum generated by the implementation of the \nSecond Decade towards poverty eradication and ensuring that markets work better \nfor people living in poverty,  \n \nReaffirming that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, \nthat its adverse impacts undermine the ability of all countries to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment, that increases in global temperature, sea level rise, ocean acidification, \nbiodiversity loss and other climate change impacts are seriously affecting coastal \nareas and low-lying coastal countries, including many least developed countries and \nsmall island developing States, and that the survival of many societies and of the \nbiological support systems of the planet is at risk, which further threatens food \nsecurity and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and \nthus requires urgent action to maintain, preserve and sustain the development gains \nachieved in the past decades,  \n \nUrging all countries that have not yet done so to ratify and accede to the United \nNations Convention against Corruption,8 encouraging parties to review its implementation, \ncommitting to making the Convention an effective instrument to deter, detect, prevent and \ncounter corruption and bribery, prosecute those involved in corrupt activities and

dimensions, including \nextreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an \noverarching objective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, of which the \nAddis Ababa Action Agenda is an integral part, as well as an ethical, social, political, \nenvironmental and economic imperative for all humankind and an indispensable \nrequirement for sustainable development, particularly in Africa, in least developed \ncountries, in landlocked developing countries, in small island developing States and \nin some middle-income countries, as well as countries in conflict and post-conflict \nsituations, and underlining the importance of addressing the multidimensional nature \nof development and poverty and accelerating sustainable, inclusive and equitable

by disasters and outbreaks,  \n \nRecognizing the centrality of mobilizing financial and non-financial resources \nfor development at the national and international levels and the effective use of those \nresources, as well as the importance of policy coherence and a coordinated approach \nthat involves participation at all levels by all actors to promote an enabling environment \nfor sustainable development, and of reinvigorating the global partnership for \nsustainable development in support of the achievement of the internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals, in particular the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \nwhich builds upon the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals,  \n \nUnderscoring that, for all countries, public policies and the mobilization and \neffective use of domestic resources, underscored by the principle of national \nownership, are central to the common pursuit of sustainable development, including \nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals, recognizing that domestic resources \nare first and foremost generated by economic growth, supported by an enabling \nenvironment at all levels, including well-functioning, efficient and transparent tax \nsystems, and acknowledging the important role that multi-stakeholder partnerships, \nincluding with the private sector, can play in generating new investments, \nemployment and financing for development,  \n \nReaffirming that official development assistance remains an important source of \nfinancing for development in developing countries,  \n \nReaffirming also that South-South cooperation is not a substitute for, but rather \na complement to, North-South cooperation, and acknowledging the contributions of \nSouth-South and triangular cooperation to the efforts of developing countries to \neradicate poverty and pursue sustainable development,  \n \nEmphasizing the essential role of inclusive and sustainable industrial development

take primary responsibility for its \nown sustainable development and that the role of national policies and development \nstrategies for the achievement of sustainable development and poverty eradication \ncannot be overemphasized, and recognizes that increased effective national efforts \nshould be complemented by concrete, effective and supportive international programmes, \nmeasures and policies aimed at expanding the development opportunities of \ndeveloping countries, while taking into account national conditions and ensuring \nrespect for national ownership strategies and sovereignty;  \n \n5. \nNotes with concern that the world as a whole is not on track to eradicate \nextreme poverty by 2030, and stresses the resolve to eradicate extreme poverty for all \npeople everywhere as well as the efforts to reduce, at least by half, the proportion of \nmen, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its forms and dimensions, \naccording to national definitions; \n \n6. \nExpresses its deep concern that, while there has been progress in reducing \npoverty, such progress remains uneven, with 1.1 billion people in 110 developing \ncountries still living in multidimensional poverty, this number continues to be \nsignificant and unacceptably high, the levels of inequality in income, wealth and \nopportunities remain high or are increasing within
