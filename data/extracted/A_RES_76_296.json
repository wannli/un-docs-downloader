Our ocean, our future, our responsibility \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecalling its resolution 73/292 of 9 May 2019 and its decision 75/578 of \n9 September 2021, in which it decided that the high-level 2022 United Nations \nConference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14: \nConserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable \ndevelopment would be held in in Lisbon, from 27 June to 1 July 2022, \n \n1. \nExpresses its profound gratitude to the Governments of Kenya and \nPortugal for discharging their co-hosting responsibilities by assuming the costs of the \nUnited Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine \nresources for sustainable development and its preparatory process and for providing \nall necessary support; \n \n2. \nEndorses the declaration entitled \u201cOur ocean, our future, our \nresponsibility\u201d adopted by the Conference, as contained in the annex to the present \nresolution. \n \n96th plenary meeting \n21 July 2022 \n \n \nAnnex \n \n \n \nOur ocean, our future, our responsibility \n \n \n1. \nWe, the Heads of State and Government and high-level representatives meeting \nin Lisbon from 27 June to 1 July 2022 at the United Nations Conference to Support \n\nA/RES/76/296 \nOur ocean, our future, our responsibility\n \n22-11524\n2/7 \n \nthe Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 of the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development, under the overarching theme, \u201cScaling up ocean action \nbased on science and innovation for the implementation of Goal 14: stocktaking, \npartnerships and solutions\u201d, with the participation of civil society and other relevant \nstakeholders, reaffirm our strong commitment to conserve and sustainably use the \nocean, seas and marine resources. Greater ambition is required at all levels to address \nthe dire state of the ocean. As leaders and representatives of our Governments, we are \ndetermined to act decisively and urgently to improve the health, productivity, \nsustainable use and resilience of the ocean and its ecosystems.  \n2. \nWe reaffirm the declaration entitled \u201cOur ocean, our future: call for action\u201d, \nadopted by the high-level United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation \nof Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas \nand marine resources for sustainable development, held from 5 to 9 June 2017.  \n3. \nWe recognize that the ocean is fundamental to life on our planet and to our \nfuture. The ocean is an important source of the planet\u2019s biodiversity and plays a vital \nrole in the climate system and water cycle. The ocean provides a range of ecosystem \nservices, supplies us with oxygen to breathe, contributes to food security, nutrition \nand decent jobs and livelihoods, acts as a sink and reservoir of greenhouse gases and \nprotects biodiversity, provides a means for maritime transportation, including for \nglobal trade, forms an important part of our natural and cultural heritage and plays an \nessential role in sustainable development, a sustainable ocean-based economy and \npoverty eradication. We underline the interlinkages and potential synergies between \nGoal 14 and the other Sustainable Development Goals and recognize that the \nimplementation of Goal 14 can contribute significantly to the realization of the 2030 \nAgenda, which is integrated and indivisible in its nature.  \n4. \nWe are therefore deeply alarmed by the global emergency facing the ocean. Sea \nlevels are rising, coastal erosion is worsening and the ocean is warmer and more \nacidic. Marine pollution is increasing at an alarming rate, a third of fish stocks are \noverexploited, marine biodiversity continues to decrease and approximately half of \nall living coral has been lost, while alien invasive species pose a significant threat to \nmarine ecosystems and resources. While progress has been made towards the \nachievement of some of the targets of Goal 14, action is not advancing at the speed \nor scale required to meet our goals. We deeply regret our collective failure to achieve \ntargets 14.2, 14.4, 14.5 and 14.6 that matured in 2020, and we renew our commitment \nto taking urgent action and to cooperating at the global, regional and subregional \nlevels to achieve all targets as soon as possible without undue delay. \n5. \nWe reaffirm that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, \nand we are deeply alarmed by the adverse effects of climate change on the ocean and \nmarine life, including the rise in ocean temperatures, ocean acidification, \ndeoxygenation, sea level rise, the decrease in polar ice coverage, shifts in the \nabundance and distribution of marine species, including fish, the decrease in marine \nbiodiversity, as well as coastal erosion and extreme weather events and related \nimpacts on island and coastal communities, as highlighted by the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change in its special report entitled The Ocean and Cryosphere in \na Changing Climate and its successive reports.  \n6. \nWe emphasize the particular importance of implementing the Paris Agreement \nadopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \nincluding the goal to limit the temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius \nabove pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to \n1.5 degrees Celsius, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and \nimpacts of climate change and help to ensure the health, productivity, sustainable use \nand resilience of the ocean and thus our future. We recall that article 2.2 of the Paris \n\nOur ocean, our future, our responsibility \nA/RES/76/296\n \n3/7\n22-11524 \n \nAgreement states that it will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of \ndifferent national circumstances. We also emphasize the need to adapt to the \nunavoidable effects of climate change. We reaffirm the importance of implementing \nthe Glasgow Climate Pact on mitigation, adaptation and the provision and \nmobilization of finance, technology transfer and capacity-building to developing \ncountries, including small island developing States. We welcome the decision by the \nparties to the Framework Convention to recognize the importance of protecting, \nconserving and restoring ecosystems, including marine ecosystems, to deliver crucial \nservices, including acting as sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases, reducing \nvulnerability to climate change impacts and supporting sustainable livelihoods, \nincluding for indigenous peoples and local communities. We further welcome the \ninvitation to relevant work programmes and constituted bodies under the Framework \nConvention to consider how to integrate and strengthen ocean-based action in relevant \nmandates and workplans and the invitation to the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for \nScientific and Technological Advice to hold an annual dialogue to strengthen ocean-\nbased action.  \n7. \nWe are deeply concerned by the findings about cumulative human impacts on \nthe ocean, including ecosystem degradation and species extinctions, as highlighted in \nthe second World Ocean Assessment and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy \nPlatform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Global Assessment Report on \nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Services, as well as on food safety and human health as \nrecognized in the One Health approach. We recognize the need for transformative \nchange and are committed to halting and reversing the decline in the health of the \nocean\u2019s ecosystems and biodiversity and to protecting and restoring its resilience and \necological integrity. We call for an ambitious, balanced, practical, effective, robust \nand transformative post-2020 global biodiversity framework for adoption at the \nsecond part of the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention \non Biological Diversity. We take note of the voluntary commitments by more than \n100 Member States to conserve or protect at least 30 per cent of the global ocean \nwithin marine protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures \nby 2030. We emphasize that strong governance and adequate financing for developing \ncountries, in particular small island developing States, is essential to effectively \nimplement and maintain such areas and measures. We also recognize the importance \nof the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021\u20132030) and its call to \nsupport and scale up efforts to prevent, halt and reverse the degradation of ecosystems \nworldwide.  \n8. \nWe welcome the decision by the United Nations Environment Assembly of the \nUnited Nations Environment Programme at its resumed fifth session, in resolution \n5/14 of 2 March 2022, to convene an intergovernmental negotiating committee to \ndevelop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in \nthe marine environment, which could include both binding and voluntary approaches, \nbased on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastic, taking \ninto account, among other things, the principles of the Rio Declaration on \nEnvironment and Development, as well as national circumstances and capabilities.  \n9. \nWe recognize the devastating impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic on the ocean-based economy and in particular the ocean-based economies \nof small island developing States, which have been disproportionately adversely \naffected by the pandemic, given their dependence on the ocean-based economy, as \nwell as on seafarers and the fishing community. We also recognize the threat to ocean \nhealth caused by the COVID-19 pandemic due to improper waste management, \nincluding of plastic waste, such as personal protective equipment, which has \nexacerbated the problem of marine plastic litter and microplastics in the ocean. We \n\nA/RES/76/296 \nOur ocean, our future, our responsibility\n \n22-11524\n4/7 \n \naffirm that the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and the advancement of \nnature-based solutions, ecosystem-based approaches play a critical role in ensuring a \nsustainable, inclusive and environmentally resilient recovery from the COVID-19 \npandemic. \n10. We emphasize that our actions to implement Goal 14 should be in accordance \nwith, reinforce and not duplicate or undermine existing legal instruments, \narrangements, processes, mechanisms or entities. We affirm the need to enhance the \nconservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing \ninternational law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \nSea, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of \nthe oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of \u201cThe future we want\u201d. \nWe note that 2022 marks the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention. \n11. We recognize the importance of the work being undertaken by the \nintergovernmental conference on an international legally binding instrument under \nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and \nsustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction \nand call upon participating delegations to reach an ambitious agreement without \ndelay.  \n12. We also recognize the importance of the United Nations Decade of Ocean \nScience for Sustainable Development (2021\u20132030) and its vision to achieve the \nscience we need for the ocean we want. We support the Decade\u2019s mission to generate \nand use knowledge for the transformational action needed to achieve a healthy, safe \nand resilient ocean for sustainable development by 2030 and beyond. We fully support \nthe work of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in implementing the Decade and \ncommit to supporting these efforts.  \n13. We stress that science-based and innovative actions and international \ncooperation and partnerships based in science, technology and innovation, in line with \nthe precautionary approach and ecosystem-based approaches, can contribute to the \nsolutions necessary to overcome challenges in achieving Goal 14 in the following \nways:  \n \n(a) \nInforming integrated ocean management, planning and decision-making, \nthrough improving our understanding of the impact of cumulative human activities \non the ocean and anticipating the impacts of planned activities and eliminating or \nminimizing their negative effects, as well as the effectiveness of adopted measures;  \n \n(b) \nRestoring and maintaining fish stocks at levels that produce at least \nmaximum sustainable yield in the shortest time feasible, including by implementing \nscience-based management plans, and minimizing waste, unwanted by-catch and \ndiscards, as well as combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, including \nthrough technological tools for monitoring, control and surveillance, and ending \nharmful subsidies in line with target 14.6, as well as through the use of an ecosystem \napproach to fisheries that protects essential habitats and promotes collaborative \nprocesses for decision-making that include all stakeholders, including small-scale and \nartisanal fisheries, recognizing their role in poverty eradication and ending food \ninsecurity, and the importance of the International Year of Artisanal Fisheries and \nAquaculture; \n \n(c) \nMobilizing actions for sustainable fisheries and sustainable aquaculture \nfor sufficient, safe and nutritious food, recognizing the central role of healthy oceans \nin resilient food systems and for achieving the 2030 Agenda;  \n \n(d) \nPreventing, reducing and controlling marine pollution of all kinds, from \nboth land- and sea-based sources, including nutrient pollution, untreated wastewater, \n\nOur ocean, our future, our responsibility \nA/RES/76/296\n \n5/7\n22-11524 \n \nsolid waste discharges, hazardous substances, emissions from the maritime sector, \nincluding shipping, pollution from shipwrecks and anthropogenic underwater noise, \nthrough improving our understanding of their sources, pathways and impacts on \nmarine ecosystems, and through contributing to comprehensive life-cycle and source-\nto-sea approaches that include improved waste management;  \n \n(e) \nPreventing, reducing and eliminating marine plastic litter, including \nsingle-use \nplastics \nand \nmicroplastics, \nincluding \nthrough \ncontributing \nto \ncomprehensive life-cycle approaches, encouraging resource efficiency and recycling, \nas well as environmentally sound waste management, ensuring sustainable \nconsumption and production patterns, developing viable alternatives for consumer \nand industrial uses, taking into account the full environmental impacts, innovation in \nproduct design and environmentally sound remediation of marine plastic litter that is \nalready in marine environments, and recognizing the establishment by the United \nNations Environment Assembly at its resumed fifth session of an intergovernmental \nnegotiating committee towards an international legally binding instrument on plastic \npollution;  \n \n(f) \nEffectively planning and implementing area-based management tools, \nincluding effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-\nconnected marine protected areas, and other effective area-based conservation \nmeasures, integrated coastal zone management and marine spatial planning, through, \ninter alia, assessing their multiple ecological, socioeconomic and cultural value and \napplying the precautionary and ecosystem-based approach, in accordance with \nnational legislation and international law;  \n \n(g) \nDeveloping and implementing measures to mitigate and adapt to climate \nchange, and avert, minimize and address loss and damage, reducing disaster risk and \nenhancing resilience, including through increasing the use of renewable energy \ntechnologies, especially ocean-based technologies, reducing the risk of and preparing \nfor ocean-related extreme weather events, including the development of multi-hazard \nearly warning systems and integrating ecosystem-based approaches for disaster risk \nreduction at all levels and across all phases of disaster risk reduction and \nmanagement, and the impacts of sea level rise, reducing emissions from maritime \ntransportation, including shipping, and implementing nature-based solutions, \necosystem-based approaches for, inter alia, carbon sequestration and the prevention \nof coastal erosion.  \n14. We commit to taking the following science-based and innovative actions on an \nurgent basis, recognizing that developing countries, in particular small island \ndeveloping States and the least developed countries, face capacity challenges that \nneed to be addressed:  \n \n(a) \nStrengthen international, regional, subregional and national scientific and \nsystematic observation and data collection efforts, including of environmental and \nsocioeconomic data, especially in developing countries, and improve the timely \nsharing and dissemination of data and knowledge, including by making data widely \naccessible through open access databases, investing in national statistical systems, \nstandardizing data, ensuring interoperability between databases, and synthesizing \ndata into information for policymakers and decision makers, and support capacity-\nbuilding in developing countries to improve data collection and analysis;
