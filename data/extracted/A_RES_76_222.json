Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations,  \n \nRemaining deeply concerned that, according to the most recent estimates of the \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Food \nProgramme, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the World Health \nOrganization and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the number of chronically \nundernourished people in the world increased to 811 million, or as many as \n161 million more in 2020 than in 2019, and that global nutrition challenges are \nincreasingly complex as multiple forms of malnutrition, including stunting, wasting, \nunderweight, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity, may coexist within \nthe same country or household,  \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety and \nwell-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the \nsevere disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives and \nlivelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the \npandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals by designing and implementing sustainable and inclusive recovery \nstrategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda \nfor Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build resilience to \nfuture shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health systems and \nachieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and timely access \nfor all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and \ndiagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, solidarity, renewed \nmultilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one behind, \n \nRecognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic, its impacts and the extraordinary \nmeasures adopted to combat it have delivered one of the most devastating blows to \nglobal food security and nutrition in recent times, with a disproportionate impact on \nwomen and children, and deeply concerned about the assessment that, in 2020, the \nCOVID-19 pandemic contributed to the largest single-year increase in hunger or the \nprevalence of chronic undernourishment in decades, accounting for as many as \n161 million more people in one year, while the global prevalence of moderate or \nsevere food insecurity for the same period is estimated to have risen by 320 million \npeople, up to 2.37 billion people, considering the specific concern of the effects of \nthe pandemic on the poor and people in vulnerable situations in Asia, parts of Latin \nAmerica and Africa, where malnutrition is estimated to affect one in five people, and \ndeeply concerned also about the estimation that more than 2 billion small producers, \nfarm labourers, family farmers, smallholder farmers and other people in vulnerable \nsituations, as well as women and children, who represent a large proportion of the \nmoderately and severely food insecure, may be disproportionately affected, \nrecognizing that hundreds of millions of people were already suffering from hunger \nand malnutrition before the virus hit, underlining that the impact of the pandemic is \nexacerbating existing high levels of acute food insecurity, malnutrition and \nhumanitarian needs, and highlighting the importance of reducing food loss and waste, \n \nRecognizing also that economic slowdown, gender inequalities, conflict, \ndrought and the adverse effects of climate change, including more frequent and \nextreme weather events, are among the key factors contributing to a reversal in the \nlong-term progress in fighting global hunger, making the prospect of ending hunger \nand all forms of malnutrition by 2030 more difficult,  \n \nRemaining deeply concerned about the continuing food insecurity and \nmalnutrition being faced by hundreds of millions of people, in particular in \nsub-Saharan Africa, in South and West Asia and in parts of Latin America,  \n\nAgriculture development, food security and nutrition \nA/RES/76/222\n \n7/15\n21-19287 \n \n \nRecognizing the need to prevent the recurrence in the future of deaths of people \nfrom famine,  \n \nExpressing its concern about the growing number of obese adults in the world, \nwith prevalence at 13.1 per cent in 2016,  \n \nExpressing concern that, according to the Global Report on Food Crises 2021, \nabout 155 million people face crisis-level food insecurity or worse in countries \naffected by, inter alia, conflict, and exacerbated by climate-related events, \nenvironmental factors, including natural disasters such as locust infestation, and \nextreme food price volatility,  \n \nNoting that an increasing number of countries, in particular in Africa, Asia, Latin \nAmerica and the Pacific, are integrating food security and nutrition into their \nagriculture policies and investment plans and that, as a result, eradicating hunger, \nimproving food security and ensuring adequate nutrition are being given greater \nprominence in regional development strategies, such as the African Union Malabo \nDeclaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation for Shared \nProsperity and Improved Livelihoods, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations food \nsecurity and nutrition strategy, the Piura Declaration on Food Security, the Framework \nfor Multi-Year Programme on Food Security and Climate Change and the Strategic \nFramework on Rural-Urban Development to Strengthen Food Security and Quality \nGrowth, adopted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Hunger-Free Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean 2025 Initiative, the strategy on food security and nutrition \nof the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, the Arab food security initiative, \nthe initiative for the Adaptation of African Agriculture to Climate Change and the \nclimate-smart agriculture strategy for the Central American Integration System region \n(2018\u20132030), all of which emphasized the importance of investing in agriculture, \ndiversifying food production and diets and providing quality nutritional education to \nconsumers, introducing labour-saving technologies in food production and processing, \nenhancing women\u2019s access to income and strengthening capacity-building in \nimproving food safety at all stages of the food chain, and noting also the establishment \nof the Islamic Organization for Food Security, headquartered in Nur-Sultan,  \n \nReiterating the urgent need for action to enhance efforts to build resilience, \nespecially for the most vulnerable, by investing in resilience, including disaster risk \nreduction, strengthening adaptation strategies and enhancing joint risk assessments and \nrisk management strategies, to cut the impact and cost of natural disasters to address the \nadverse effects of climate change on food security, in particular for women, youth, older \npersons, indigenous peoples, local communities and persons with disabilities, as well as \nthe other root causes of food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition,  \n \nExpressing concern that climate change will disproportionately impact people \nin vulnerable situations, especially women and children, and their livelihoods, \nultimately putting hundreds of millions of people at risk, and that by 2050, the risk of \nhunger and child malnutrition could increase by up to 20 per cent owing to climate \nchange,  \n \nReiterating the importance of achieving gender equality and the empowerment \nof women and girls, as well as the recognition and protection of the rights of \nsmallholders, particularly women, reiterating also the importance, inter alia, of \nsupporting the empowerment of rural women, youth, small-scale farmers, family \nfarmers and livestock farmers, fishers and fish workers as critical agents for \nenhancing agricultural and rural development and food security and for improving \nnutrition outcomes, and acknowledging their fundamental contribution to the \nenvironmental sustainability and the genetic preservation of agricultural systems and \nto sustaining productivity on often marginal lands,  \n\nA/RES/76/222 \nAgriculture development, food security and nutrition\n \n21-19287\n8/15 \n \n \nRecognizing that livestock contributes 40 per cent of the global value of \nagricultural output and supports the livelihoods and food security of almost 1.3 billion \npeople, and in this regard acknowledging that the sector offers opportunities for \nagricultural development, poverty eradication and food security gains, and offers an \nopportunity for raising climate awareness,  \n \nAcknowledging that social protection programmes and measures are effective in \nreducing poverty and hunger,  \n \nNoting the importance of initiatives under the United Nations system, including \nthe observance of World Pulses Day, World Tuna Day, Sustainable Gastronomy Day, \nWorld Bee Day, World Food Safety Day, World Soil Day, the International Year of \nCamelids, the International Year of Plant Health, the International Year of Fruits and \nVegetables, International Tea Day, International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and \nWaste, the International Decade for Action, \u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201d, \n2018\u20132028, and the United Nations Decade of Family Farming (2019\u20132028), aimed \nat increasing public awareness of relevant agriculture, food security and nutritional \nbenefits, in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 53/199 of 15 December \n1998 and 61/185 of 20 December 2006 on the proclamation of international years and \nEconomic and Social Council resolution 1980/67 of 25 July 1980 on international \nyears and anniversaries,  \n \nRecognizing the need to increase responsible public and private investments and \npartnerships in the agriculture sector, inter alia, to find inclusive solutions to and fight \nhunger and malnutrition and to promote rural and urban sustainable development,  \n \nRecalling the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030 and \nits guiding principles, 27  and recalling also its promotion of regular disaster risk \npreparedness, prevention, response and recovery exercises, at the national and local \nlevels, with a view to ensuring rapid and effective response to disasters and related \ndisplacement, including access to essential food and non-food relief supplies, as \nappropriate to local needs,  \n \nNoting that, in 2011, an initial estimate reported that one third of the food \nproduced annually in the world for human consumption, equivalent to some \n1.3 billion tons, was lost or wasted, while it is estimated that there are up to \n811 million people in the world who are hungry and nearly 149.2 million children \nunder 5 years of age were affected by stunting in 2020,  \n \nRecalling that the Sustainable Development Goals and targets are integrated and \nindivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development, and \nacknowledging that reaching Goal 2 and the interlinked targets of other Goals will be \ncritical, inter alia, in ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition,  \n \nReiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind, reaffirming the \nrecognition that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, and the wish to see \nthe Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments
