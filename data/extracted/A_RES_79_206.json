such as \nmountain glaciers, further threatening food security, water availability and \nlivelihoods, and efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions and \nachieve sustainable development, recognizes the substantial risks posed by climate \nchange to health, and emphasizes in this regard that mitigation of and adaptation to \nclimate change represent an immediate and urgent global priority;  \n \n2. \nUrges Member States to adopt a climate- and environment-responsive \napproach to COVID-19 recovery efforts, including by aligning investments and \ndomestic policies with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 28 the goals of \nthe Paris Agreement for its parties and the ultimate objective of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, in order to achieve a sustainable, resilient \nand inclusive recovery, and accelerate a transition to low-emission, climate-resilient, \ninclusive and sustainable economies and societies, in this regard stresses the need to \nstrengthen the global response to climate change by increasing the ability of countries \nto adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, fostering resilience, accelerating the \nfull implementation of all the Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda and integrating \nclimate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning, urges parties \nto the Paris Agreement to communicate or update ambitious nationally determined \ncontributions, noting that article 4, paragraph 3, of the Agreement states that each \nparty\u2019s successive nationally determined contribution will represent a progression \nbeyond the party\u2019s then current nationally determined contribution and reflect its \nhighest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities \nand respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, \nencourages parties to formulate and communicate long-term strategies on the basis of \nthe best available scientific knowledge and with a view to achieving the purpose of \nthe Agreement and making financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low \ngreenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development, and stresses the \nimportance of mobilizing means of implementation from all sources, including \nadequate financial support, inter alia, for mitigation and adaptation, taking into \naccount the specific needs and special circumstances of developing countries, \nespecially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate \nchange;  \n \n3. \nEncourages all the parties to the Paris Agreement to fully implement the \nAgreement, and highlights the synergies between the implementation of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the Agreement;  \n \n4. \nRecalls that the Paris Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including its objective, \naims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of \nsustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by holding the \nincrease in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above \npre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees \nCelsius above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce \nthe risks and impacts of climate change, increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse \nimpacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas \nemissions development in a manner that does not threaten food production, and \nmaking finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas \nemissions and climate-resilient development;  \n \n5. \nReaffirms the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in \nthe global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial \nlevels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius \nabove pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks \n__________________ \n \n28 Resolution 70/1. \n\nA/RES/79/206 \nProtection of global climate for present and future generations \nof humankind\n \n24-24348\n8/14 \n \nand impacts of climate change, underscores that the impacts of climate change will \nbe much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared with \n2 degrees Celsius, and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to \n1.5 degrees Celsius, recognizes that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius \nwith no or limited overshoot requires deep, rapid and sustained reductions in global \ngreenhouse gas emissions of 43 per cent by 2030 and 60 per cent by 2035 relative to \nthe 2019 level and reaching net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, commits to \naccelerate action in this critical decade on the basis of the best available science, \nreflecting equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and \nrespective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances and in the \ncontext of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, and, in \naccordance with article 4 of the Paris Agreement, reiterates the aim to reach global \npeaking of greenhouse gas emissions, as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking \nwill take longer for developing countries, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter \nin accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between \nanthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the \nsecond half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable \ndevelopment and efforts to eradicate poverty;  \n \n6. \nRecalls, in line with decisions 1/CMA.3 and 1/CMA.4, 29  the call to \naccelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies and the \nadoption of policies to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by \nrapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency \nmeasures, including accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal \npower and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, while providing targeted \nsupport to the poorest and most vulnerable, in line with national circumstances, and \nrecognizing the need for support towards a just transition;  \n \n7. \nWelcomes the nationally determined contributions submitted to date, and \nrecalls that the regular updating of such contributions will reflect the highest possible \nlevel of ambition, in the light of different national circumstances, and provide the \ninformation necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding, in accordance with \nthe relevant decisions;  \n \n8. \nNotes with concern that, according to the synthesis report on nationally \ndetermined contributions 30  published by the secretariat of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, the nationally determined contributions \npresented thus far by the parties to the Paris Agreement are not sufficient and that \naction is needed to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below \n2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the \ntemperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, urges parties \nthat have not yet communicated new or updated nationally determined contributions \nto do so as soon as possible, and encourages parties to communicate in 2025 \nnationally determined contributions with an end date of 2035, in 2030 a nationally \ndetermined contribution with an end date of 2040 and so forth every five years \nthereafter;  \n \n9. \nRecalls article 3 and article 4, paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 11, of the Paris \nAgreement and requests parties that have not yet done so to revisit and strengthen the \n2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions, as necessary, to align with \nthe Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2024, taking into account \ndifferent
