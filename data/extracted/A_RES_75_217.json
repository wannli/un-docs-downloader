the threat of climate change, in the context \nof sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by holding the \nincrease in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above \npre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to \n1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would \nsignificantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change, increasing the ability to \nadapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low \ngreenhouse gas emissions development in a manner that does not threaten food \nproduction, and making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low \ngreenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development; \n \n5. \nWelcomes
