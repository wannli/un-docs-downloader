International \nDecades for the Eradication of Colonialism,  \n \nRecognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of \nGuam require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for self-\ndetermination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, size of \npopulation or natural resources,  \n \nConvinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should \ncontinue to guide the development of their future political status and that \nreferendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an \nimportant role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people, \n \nConcerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of \nthe Territories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world \neconomy and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering \nPowers that are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to \nresolution 1514 (XV),  \n \nConvinced that any negotiations to

basis, and that the views \nof the people of Guam in respect of their right to self-determination should be \nascertained,  \n \nNoting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories

ensure that the appropriate \nbodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at \nassisting the people of Guam with their inalienable right to self-determination and in \ngaining a better understanding of the options for self-determination, on a case-by-\ncase basis,  \n \nMindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the \nCaribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of \nrepresentatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for \nthe Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the \nseminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element \nin the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of \nthe Territories,  \n \nWelcoming the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme \u201cImplementation of the \nThird International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism:

States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies \nof the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,  \n \nNoting with concern that a plebiscite on self-determination has been brought to \na halt, which followed the ruling 7  of a federal court in the United States, the \nadministering Power, holding that the plebiscite could not be limited to native \ninhabitants, and noting also that there is an ongoing appeals process, \n \nNoting, in this regard, the statement made by a representative of the Governor \nof Guam at the 2019 Caribbean regional seminar concerning the implications of the \njudicial case in the light of the nature and essence of the Charter of the United Nations \nand resolution 1514 (XV),  \n \nCognizant of the efforts made by the Guam Commission on Decolonization

measure of internal self-government for Guam and recognition \nof the right of the CHamoru people of Guam to self-determination for the Territory,  \n \nAware that negotiations between the administering Power and the territorial \nGovernment on the draft Guam Commonwealth Act ended in 1997 and that Guam has \nsubsequently established a non-binding plebiscite process for a self-determination \nvote by the eligible CHamoru voters,  \n \nCognizant of the importance of the administering Power implementing its \nprogramme of transferring surplus federal land to the Government of Guam,  \n__________________ \n \n5  Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-fourth Session, Supplement No. 23 (A/74/23). \n \n6  See resolution 65/119. \n \n7  District Court
