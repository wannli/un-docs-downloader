technologies, \nincluding efficient irrigation, the reuse of treated wastewater and water harvesting \nand storage for indigenous peoples and others living in rural areas, \n \nRecognizing further the complex character of food insecurity and its likely \nrecurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the \nglobal financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and \nthe impacts of global climate change, as well as poverty, natural disasters, armed \nconflicts, drought, volatility in commodity prices and the lack in many countries of \nthe appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront \nits impact, particularly in developing countries, the least developed countries and \nsmall island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between \ninternational institutions at the global level, \n \nNoting with great concern that millions of people are facing famine or the \nimmediate risk of famine or are experiencing severe food insecurity in several regions \nof the world, and noting also that poverty, armed conflicts, drought and the volatility \nof commodity prices are among the factors causing or exacerbating famine and severe \nfood insecurity and that additional efforts, including international support, to respond, \nprevent and prepare for increasing global food insecurity are urgently needed, \n \nStressing the obligation of all States and parties to an armed conflict to protect \ncivilians, in accordance with international humanitarian law, and calling upon \nMember States, the United Nations and other relevant organizations to take further \nsteps to provide a coordinated emergency response to the food and nutrition needs of \naffected populations, while aiming to ensure that such steps are supportive of national \nstrategies and programmes aimed at improving food security and nutrition, \n \nReaffirming that starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited \nunder international humanitarian law and that it is therefore prohibited to attack, \ndestroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable

works, \n \nResolved to act to ensure that the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all \nhuman rights and the human rights perspective are taken into account at the national, \nregional and international levels in measures to address the realization of the right to \nfood, \n \nStressing the possible benefits of international trade to improve food and \nnutrition availability, \n \nStressing also that improving access to productive resources and investment in \nrural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in \ndeveloping countries, through, inter alia, the promotion of investments in appropriate \nsmall-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce \nvulnerability to droughts and tackle water scarcity, as well as in programmes, \npractices and policies to scale up sustainable agroecological approaches, \n \nExpressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, \ndiseases and pest infestations, as well as the negative impact of climate change, and \ntheir increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in substantial loss of life \n\nA/RES/73/171 \nThe right to food\n \n18-22267\n4/11 \n \nand livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, \nin particular in developing countries, \n \nConcerned that the impacts of climate change and natural disasters are harming \nagricultural productivity, food production and cropping patterns, thus contributing to \nfood availability shortfalls, and that such impacts are expected to increase with future \nclimate change, \n \nExpressing its deep concern over the negative effects of armed conflicts on the \nenjoyment of the right to food, \n \nEmphasizing that a multisectoral approach that integrates nutrition across all \nsectors, including agriculture, health, water and sanitation, social protection and \neducation, as well as a gender perspective, is critical to achieving global food and \nnutrition security and the realization of the right to food, \n \nRecalling the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible \nGovernance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food \nSecurity10 by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held \non 11 May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and

of 27 July 2012, \n \nRecalling also the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u2013203012 \nand its guiding principles, which, inter alia, recognize the importance of promoting \nregular disaster preparedness and response and recovery exercises, with a view to \nensuring rapid and effective response to disasters and related displacement, including \naccess to essential food and non-food relief supplies, as appropriate to local needs, as \nwell as of fostering collaboration across global and regional mechanisms and \ninstitutions for the implementation and coherence of instruments and tools relevant \nto disaster risk reduction, such as for climate change, biodiversity, sustainable \ndevelopment, poverty eradication, environment, agriculture, health, food and \nnutrition and others, as appropriate, \n \nRecalling further the proclamation at its seventieth session of 2016\u20132025 as the \nUnited Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition, and stressing the opportunity the \nDecade represents to bring together initiatives and efforts to eradicate hunger and \nprevent all forms of malnutrition,  \n \nAcknowledging the work done by the High-level Task Force on Global Food and \nNutrition Security established by the Secretary-General, and supporting the \nSecretary-General in his continuing efforts in this regard, including continued \nengagement with Member States and the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights \nCouncil on the right to food, \n \n1. \nReaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human \ndignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, \nregional and international levels for its elimination; \n \n2. \nAlso reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and \nnutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right \nof everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his \nor her physical and mental capacities; \n \n3. \nConsiders it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund, up to 45 per cent of the children who die every year before the age \nof 5 die from undernutrition and hunger-related illness and that, as estimated by the \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people in \nthe world affected by undernourishment, or chronic food deprivation, increased from \naround 804 million in 2016 to nearly 821 million in 2017; \n \n4. \nExpresses its concern at the fact that the effects created by the world food \ncrisis still continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable \npeople, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by \nthe impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of \n__________________ \n \n12  Resolution 69/283, annex II. \n\nA/RES/73/171 \nThe right to food\n \n18-22267\n6/11 \n \nthe crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially the least developed \ncountries; \n \n5. \nExpresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Security \nand Nutrition in the World 2018, the number of hungry people in the world is \nunacceptably high, the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries \nand the number of undernourished people in the world has been on the rise since 2016, \nreaching an estimated 821 million in 2017; \n \n6. \nAlso expresses its deep concern that, while women contribute more than \n50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the \nworld\u2019s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food \ninsecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that \nin many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and \npreventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many \nwomen as men suffer from malnutrition; \n \n7. \nEncourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security \nprogrammes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and \ndiscrimination against women, in particular when they contribute to the malnutrition \nof women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the \nright to food and that women have equal access to resources, including income, land \nand water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access \nto health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves \nand their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and \nstrengthen their role in decision-making; \n \n8. \nEncourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the \nright to food to continue to mainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of her \nmandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to \nfood and food insecurity and malnutrition to continue to integrate a gender \nperspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities; \n \n9. \nReaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and \nnutritious food are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities; \n \n10. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect \nthe right to food and that the international community should provide, through a \ncoordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support of \nnational and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food \nproduction and access to food, including through agricultural development assistance, \nthe transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, ensuring \nfood security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, and \npromoting innovation, support for the development of adapted technologies, research \non rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and ensure \nsupport for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; \n \n11. \nCalls upon all States and, if appropriate, relevant international \norganizations to take measures and support programmes that are aimed at combating \nundernutrition in mothers, in particular during pregnancy, and in children, and the \nirreversible effects of chronic undernutrition in early childhood, in particular from \nbirth to the age of 2 years; \n \n12. Also calls upon all States and, where appropriate, relevant international \norganizations to implement policies and programmes to reduce and eliminate \npreventable mortality and morbidity, as a result of malnutrition, of children under \n5 years of age, and in this regard urges States to disseminate the technical guidance \n\nThe right to food \nA/RES/73/171\n \n7/11\n18-22267 \n \nprepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, \nin collaboration with the World Health Organization, 13 and to apply it, as appropriate, \nin the design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring of laws, policies, \nprogrammes, budgets and mechanisms for remedy and redress aimed at eliminating \npreventable mortality and morbidity of children under 5 years of age; \n \n13. Encourages all States to take steps, with a view to progressively achieving \nthe full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions for \neveryone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to \nfood, and to create and adopt national plans to combat hunger; \n \n14. Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in \ndeveloping countries and regions in connection with food security and the \ndevelopment of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food; \n \n15. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public \ninvestment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in \nparticular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investment, \nincluding private investment, in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water \nmanagement technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts and to tackle \nwater scarcity; \n \n16. Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the \nrealization of the right to food and to food security and the contribution of small-scale \nfishers to the local food security of coastal communities; \n \n17. Also recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, where \nnearly half a billion family farmers are located, and that these people are especially \nvulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm \nincomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing \nchallenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural \npolicies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and \ninsurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security \nand rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing \ncommunities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access for \ntheir products to national and international markets and empowerment of small \nproducers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and \nthe provision of the right to food; \n \n18. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through \nnational efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and \nland degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically \nappropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation \nof the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries \nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 14  \n \n19. Urges States that have not yet done so to favourably consider becoming \nparties to the Convention on Biological Diversity15 and to consider becoming parties \nto the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture 16 as \na matter of priority; \n__________________ \n \n13  A/HRC/27/31; see also Human Rights Council resolution 33/11 (see Official Records of the \nGeneral Assembly, Seventy-first Session, Supplement No. 53A and corrigendum (A/71/53/Add.1 \nand A/71/53/Add.1/Corr.1), chap.

Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \nPeoples,17 acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of \nindigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the \nobstacles and challenges they face in achieving the full enjoyment of the right to food, \nand calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the \ndisproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples \nand the continuous discrimination against them; \n \n22. Also recalls the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of \nthe General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, held \non 22 and 23 September 2014,18 and the commitment to developing, in conjunction \nwith the indigenous peoples concerned and where appropriate, policies, programmes \nand resources to support indigenous peoples\u2019 occupations, traditional subsistence \nactivities, economies, livelihoods, food security and nutrition; \n \n23. Notes the need to further examine various concepts, such as \u201cfood \nsovereignty\u201d, and their relation to food security and the right to food, bearing in mind \nthe need to avoid any negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to food for all \npeople at all times; \n \n24. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international \norganizations, within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to \npromote the effective realization of the right to food for all; \n \n25. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment, as well as \ninternational assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected \ncountries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food, and in \nparticular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their \nhomes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting their \nenjoyment of the right to food; \n \n26. Takes note with appreciation of the growing movement, in different \nregions of the world, towards the adoption of framework laws, national strategies and \nmeasures in support of the full realization of the right to food for all; \n \n27.

Stresses that all States should make all efforts to ensure that their \ninternational policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade \nagreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; \n \n30. Recalls the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against \nHunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying \n__________________ \n \n17  Resolution 61/295, annex. \n \n18  Resolution 69/2. \n\nThe right to food \nA/RES/73/171\n \n9/11\n18-22267 \n \nadditional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty, as well as \nnon-communicable diseases; \n \n31. Recognizes that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to \nhalve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while \nrecognizing the efforts of Member States in this regard, and once again invites all \ninternational financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United \nNations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the funding necessary to \nrealize the right to food, as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, \nand to achieve the aims of Goal 2 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 4 \nand other food and nutrition-related targets; \n \n32. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that \nall people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet \ntheir dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a \ncomprehensive effort to improve public health, alongside the response to the spread \nof HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; \n \n33. Urges States to give priority in their development strategies and \nexpenditures to the realization of the right to food; \n \n34.

Also stresses that States parties to the World Trade Organization \nAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights should consider \nimplementing that agreement in a manner that is supportive of food security, while \nbeing mindful of the obligation of Member States to promote and protect the right to \nfood; \n \n36. Calls upon Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant \nstakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food crises \ncurrently occurring across different regions, and expresses its deep concern that \nfunding shortfalls are forcing the World Food Programme to cut operations across \ndifferent regions, including Southern Africa; \n \n37. Calls upon Member States, the United Nations, humanitarian and \ndevelopment organizations and other relevant actors to urgently and effectively \nrespond to, prevent and prepare for rising global food insecurity affecting millions of \npeople, especially those who are facing famine or the immediate risk of famine, \nincluding by enhancing humanitarian and development cooperation and providing \nurgent funding to respond to the needs of the affected population, and calls upon \nMember States and parties to armed conflicts to respect international humanitarian \nlaw and ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access; \n \n38.
