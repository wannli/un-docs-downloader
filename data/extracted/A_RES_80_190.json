respecting and \nprotecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing \nfurther that empowering children requires their active and meaningful participation \nin decision-making processes in accordance with their evolving capacities or age and \nmaturity and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, while \nacknowledging that all parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and \ndevelopment of the child, with the best interests of the child as their basic concern, \n \nRecognizing also that the full realization of the rights of
