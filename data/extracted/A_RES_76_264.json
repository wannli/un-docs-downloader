B. \n\nA/RES/76/264 \nState of global food insecurity \n \n22-07925 \n2/5 \n \n \nExpressing concern that the rise in food prices is reversing years of progress in \nreducing hunger and further undermining the efforts to achieve Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 2,2 exacerbating inequalities, especially between rural and urban \nareas, and disproportionately affecting the poor, persons with disabilities, women, \nyouth, older persons and children, as well as those living in vulnerable situations, \n \nExpressing its deep concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per cent \nof the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the world\u2019s \nhungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food \ninsecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that \nin many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and \npreventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many \nwomen as men suffer from malnutrition, \n \nNoting the continued crisis in supply chains and the disruptions to transport and \nshipping, contributing to a surge in shipping and transport costs, particularly affecting \ndeveloping countries, \n \nNoting also the rise in energy and fuel prices, which is increasing food \ncommodity prices, narrowing fiscal space at a time when the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing debt vulnerabilities and exposed \nfragilities in the global financial architecture, with many developing countries at high \nrisk of or already in debt distress, \n \nDeeply concerned, in this regard, that 60 per cent of least developed countries \nand other low-income countries are now assessed to be at high risk of or already in \ndebt distress, while around a quarter of middle-income countries remain at high risk, \n \nNoting with concern that droughts and other adverse effects of climate change, \nincluding more frequent and extreme weather events, are among the key factors \ncontributing to a reversal in the long-term progress in fighting global hunger, \nmalnutrition and food insecurity, making the prospect of ending hunger and all forms \nof malnutrition by 2030 more difficult, \n \nRecognizing that armed conflict impacts on food security can be direct, such as \ndisplacement from land, livestock grazing areas and fishing grounds or destruction of \nfood stocks and agricultural assets, or indirect, such as disruptions to food systems \nand markets, leading to increased food prices or decreased household purchasing \npower, or decreased access to supplies that are necessary for food preparation, \nincluding water and fuel, \n \nDeeply concerned that food insecurity could aggravate social and civil unrest \nand instability, \n \nExpressing deep concern about the impact of the food security crisis on the \nassistance provided by United Nations humanitarian agencies, in particular the World \nFood Programme, \nthe United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund, the Office \nfor the \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat and the Office of the United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, \n \nWelcoming the call for urgent coordinated action on food security made on \n13 April 2022 by the heads of the World Bank Group, the International Monetary \nFund, the World Food Programme and the World Trade Organization, \n \nNoting the outcomes of the 2021 United Nations Food Systems Summit \nconvened by the Secretary-General, \n__________________ \n \n2  See resolution 70/1. \n\nState of global food insecurity \nA/RES/76/264 \n \n3/5 \n22-07925 \n \n \nReaffirming the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious \nfood, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone \nto be free from hunger, \n \nDetermined to address the global food security crisis on the basis of unity, \nsolidarity and renewed multilateral cooperation, and recognizing the fundamental role \nof the United Nations system in catalysing and coordinating a comprehensive global \nresponse, under the leadership of the Secretary-General, \n \n1. \nCalls upon the international community to urgently support countries \naffected by the food security crisis through coordinated actions, including the \nprovision of emergency food supplies, food programmes, financial support, and \nincreased and diversified agricultural production, and to promote a universal, rules -\nbased, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under the \nWorld Trade Organization;
