Also reaffirms that voluntary repatriation should not necessarily be \nconditioned on the accomplishment of political solutions in the country of origin in \norder not to impede the exercise of the refugees\u2019 right to return, recognizes that the \nvoluntary repatriation and reintegration process is normally guided by the conditions \nin the country of origin, in particular that voluntary repatriation can be accomplished \nin conditions of safety and dignity, and urges the High Commissioner to promote \nsustainable return through the development of durable and lasting solutions, \nparticularly in protracted refugee situations;  \n \n26.

Encourages African States, together with development and humanitarian \nactors, to work closely on multi-year strategies for refugees and internally displaced \npersons, factoring in the subregional dimension of many forced displacement crises; \n \n34.
