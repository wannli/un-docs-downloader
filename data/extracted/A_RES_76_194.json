\nincluding for food and agriculture, and its consequences for global food security and \nimproved nutrition outcomes, noted the Agricultural Market Information System \nhosted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and called for \nthe provision of access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and \nmarkets, consistent with sustainable management practices as well as initiatives that \nadd value to outputs from small-scale fishers, and noting that, in The State of Food \nSecurity and Nutrition in the World 2019: Safeguarding against Economic Slowdowns \nand Downturns, the Food and Agriculture Organization highlighted that 80 per cent \nof the countries \u2013 52 out of 65 \u2013 with a rise in hunger and an increase in \nundernourishment during recent economic slowdowns and downturns are countries \nwhose economies are highly dependent on primary commodities for export and/or \nimport, \n \nNoting the outcome of the fifteenth session

Commodity Dependence Trap through \nTechnology and Innovation, and its State of Commodity Dependence reports and its \nnote on commodity dependence and the Sustainable Development Goals, and noting \nthe role that the Conference has been playing as an institution in looking at the \ninteraction between commodity markets and economic development and in the \nelaboration of the concept of commodity-dependent developing countries, \n \nUnderlining the importance of advancing sustainable consumption and \nproduction patterns, \n \nNoting with concern that the prices of most commodities exhibited a downward \ntrend, driven by a variety of factors relating to supply and demand and changing \ninventories, \n \nRecognizing that commodity price volatility, including excessive volatility, can \nhave adverse impacts on both producer and consumer countries, particularly in \ncommodity-dependent countries, and noting with concern that this can undermine \ntheir development efforts, as it could discourage investment, widen trade deficits and \naggravate household poverty, \n \nNoting that commodity price movements have both macroeconomic and \nmicroeconomic implications for commodity-dependent developing countries, as well \nas net commodity-importing developing countries, and further noting that rises in \ncommodity prices may contribute to improvements by exporting countries in their \nexport and fiscal revenue, allowing them to increase current and capital government \nexpenditure, and that, by contrast, a decline in commodity prices may lead to \nshortfalls in export and fiscal earnings and the inability of Governments to deliver \nbasic goods and services, \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety \nand well-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as \nthe severe disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives \nand livelihoods, and that the poorest and

by designing and implementing sustainable and inclusive \nrecovery strategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build \nresilience to future shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health \nsystems and achieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and \ntimely access for all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, \ntherapeutics and diagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, \nsolidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one \nbehind, \n \nNoting that the global crises triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and its \nunprecedented negative health, economic, social and humanitarian impacts are \nreversing vital gains made in human development and sustainable development goals, \nthat, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 5 million people have \nlost their lives owing to the virus, global gross domestic product contracted severely \nin 2020, millions of people have lost their jobs and millions more have had their \nlivelihoods compromised, that the food security of millions of people, including \nchildren, has seriously deteriorated, that, most disturbingly, more than 150 million \npeople are expected to fall into extreme poverty by the end of 2021, that countries \ndependent on commodities exports or on a limited number of economic activities have \nbeen particularly hard hit and that the pandemic has also led to severe commodity \nprice variations, which have deepened the challenges faced by commodity-dependent \ncountries, \n \nExpressing concern that the global economy has yet to recover completely and \nremains in a challenging phase, notwithstanding the recent cyclical pickup in global \neconomic activity, that growth remains weak in many countries and includes subdued \ntrade growth, volatile capital flows, widespread fiscal strains and unsustainable debt \nin some countries, particularly developing countries, and that commodity exporters \nare particularly hard hit owing to their continued adjustment to a sharp step-down in \nforeign earnings, recognizing that, while short-term risks are broadly balanced, \nmedium-term risks are still tilted to the downside, and in this regard stressing the need \nfor continuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances, to reform and \nstrengthen the international financial system and to make further progress towards \nsustaining and rebalancing global demand, \n \nRecognizing the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities, \nespecially on women, girls, young people and people in vulnerable situations, \n \nRecognizing also that the structural constraints that women face as economic \nagents, including segmentation in low-value-added or subsistence-oriented work, \nunequal access to productive resources, limited access to training and skill-building \ndue to gender segmentation in education and labour markets and a lack of resources, \nas well as the heavy burden of unpaid work, make women and girls especially \nvulnerable to the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities, \n \nStressing the importance of policies to address longer-term structural issues, \nincluding structural constraints faced by women as economic agents, to diversify \ncommodity economies and to integrate commodity policies into wider development \nand poverty eradication strategies at all levels, \n \nRecognizing that uncertainty in global commodity markets reinforces the need \nto comprehensively deal with the commodity problematique, inter alia, the demand \nfor commodities, supply capacities, commodity revenues and investments in \ncommodity-dependent economies, while taking due account of the diversity of each \ncountry\u2019s individual situation and needs and the promotion of their sustainable \ndevelopment, and to strengthen the nexus between, inter alia, trade, finance, \ninvestment in sustainable agriculture and food systems, energy and industrialization, \n\nCommodities \nA/RES/76/194\n \n5/9\n21-19295 \n \n \nNoting the work on consensus-building on commodity-related issues achieved \nthrough meetings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \nincluding the multi-year expert meetings on commodities and development, the \nGlobal Commodities Forum and the African Oil, Gas and Mines Trade and Finance \nConference and Exhibition, \n \nUnderlining the importance of timely, accurate and transparent information to \nensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets, in accordance with the 2030 \nAgenda, noting global and regional initiatives, including the Agricultural Market \nInformation System and its Rapid Response Forum, the joint organization data initiative \nand other regional data platforms and programmes, and urging the participating \ninternational organizations, private sector actors and Governments to ensure the public \ndissemination of timely and quality food market information products, \n \nExpressing deep concern at the adverse impact of climate change and extreme \nweather patterns on access to, and the utilization and prices of, agricultural \ncommodities, while recognizing the important role of land and sustainable land \nmanagement in the climate system, \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General on world commodity \ntrends and prospects;13 \n \n2. \nRecognizes the interlinkage between the adequate and transparent \nfunctioning of commodity markets and the capacity of some commodity-dependent \ndeveloping countries to collect appropriate fiscal revenues from commodity exports \nand mobilize domestic resources to support the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and their sustainable development, including through sustainable \nand inclusive economic growth, industrialization, decent work and market \ndiversification; \n \n3. \nEncourages support for developing countries, according to their national \nplans and policies, through technical assistance, to increase their capacity in detecting \nand averting trade mispricing in their commodities sectors in order to enhance their \nbenefits from those sectors to support the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals; \n \n4. \nReiterates the need for further efforts to address excessive commodity \nprice volatility, in particular by assisting producers, especially small-scale producers, \nincluding women, in accordance with national plans and policies, in managing risk; \n \n5. \nStresses that developing countries, including African countries, the least \ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing \nStates, face particular challenges as lower prices for the commodities that they \nproduce threaten the sustainable growth and the debt positions of such countries, and \ntherefore notes that, in this context, economic and export diversification, value \naddition and industrialization can contribute to strengthening resilience to excessive \nprice volatility by allowing the derivation of revenue from various sources; \n \n6. \nRecognizes the need to continue efforts to diversify economies, as well as \nto improve the regulation, where appropriate, and the efficiency, responsiveness, \nfunctioning and transparency of financial and commodity markets nationally, \nregionally and internationally; \n \n7. \nAcknowledges two main diversification strategies, one being horizontal \ndiversification to export different types of commodities and other products to \ndifferent markets, and the other being vertical diversification through value addition, \nand notes that these diversification strategies can contribute to creating sustained jobs \n__________________ \n \n13 A/76/215. \n\nA/RES/76/194 \nCommodities\n \n21-19295\n6/9 \n \nand foster an inclusive and sustainable process of industrialization in order to achieve \nthe Sustainable Development Goals; \n \n8. \nRecognizes the relationship between technological change, innovation, \neconomic diversification and structural transformation, notes with concern that most \ncommodity-dependent developing countries have made minimal gains in closing \ntechnological gaps in the past 25 years, and notes that acquiring technological \ncapabilities on mutually agreed terms and adopting policies and exploring the creation \nof national institutions, as appropriate, that foster innovation and technological \ndevelopment in line with the Sustainable Development Goals could help to close those \ngaps; \n \n9. \nEncourages Member States, development partners and the private sector \nto promote economic diversification in commodity-dependent developing countries \nby means of responsible and sustainable investments in productive capacity, physical \ncapital accumulation, human capacity-building, infrastructure, the improvement of \nscience and technology capabilities and the strengthening of institutions and \ngovernance, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, while considering that \ndiversification strategies can contribute to the creation of decent work and economic \ngrowth \n(Goal \n8) \nand \nbuild \nresilient \ninfrastructure, \npromote \nsustainable \nindustrialization and foster innovation (Goal 9); \n \n10. Calls upon the international community to support the efforts of and foster \ncooperation with commodity-dependent developing countries to address the factors \nthat create structural barriers to international trade and impede, inter alia, \ndiversification, including tariff and non-tariff barriers, limited access to financial \nservices resulting in scarce resources for investing in the commodity sector, weak \ninfrastructure, particularly regarding both the cost and availability of transportation \nand storage, and lack of skills in producing and marketing alternative products; \n \n11. \nEmphasizes the importance of enhanced collaboration between the public \nand private sectors and high levels of investment in commodity-dependent developing \ncountries to promote diversification and upgrade productive structures integrated into \nglobal value chains for sustainable development; \n \n12. Welcomes the convening of the twelfth Ministerial Conference of the \nWorld Trade Organization from 30 November to 3 December 2021 in Geneva; \n \n13. Notes with concern that the slow and uneven recovery from the COVID-19 \npandemic particularly harms developing countries, including commodity-dependent \ndeveloping countries, and acknowledges that international trade can play a role in \nachieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development14 and sustainable, robust \nand balanced growth for all; \n \n14. Calls for a coherent set of policy actions at the national, regional and \ninternational levels to address excessive price volatility and support commodity-\ndependent developing countries in mitigating negative impacts, in particular by \nfacilitating value addition and enhancing their participation in commodity and related \nproduct value chains, by supporting large-scale diversification of these economies \nand by encouraging the use and further development of market-oriented risk \nmanagement tools, instruments and strategies; \n \n15. Stresses the importance of developing and strengthening agricultural \npolicies and strategies that recognize and address women\u2019s critical role in food \nsecurity and improved nutrition outcomes as an integral part of both short- and long-\n__________________ \n \n14 Resolution 70/1. \n\nCommodities \nA/RES/76/194\n \n7/9\n21-19295 \n \nterm responses to food insecurity and malnutrition and food crises in developing \ncountries; \n \n16. Recognizes the potential for innovation, productivity improvements and \nthe promotion of non-traditional exports in most commodity-dependent developing \ncountries, particularly in Africa, and calls for enhanced support by the international \ncommunity as well as exchanges of experience in these areas within the framework \nof South-South economic cooperation; \n \n17. Underscores the importance of increased investments in quality, reliable, \nsustainable and resilient infrastructure as a means of promoting sustainable \nagricultural development and enhancing commodity diversification, including value-\nadded production, and trade, and urges the international community to assist \ncommodity-dependent developing countries to mainstream trade as well as sound \ninvestment and financial policies as key elements of development strategies, based \non national circumstances and development priorities, and to invest in and support \nresearch, innovation and development of sustainable agriculture productivity; \n \n18. \nStresses that technical assistance and capacity-building aimed at improving \nthe commodity export competitiveness of producers are particularly important for \ndeveloping countries, especially in Africa, and invites Member States and all relevant \nstakeholders to provide the necessary resources for commodity-specific financial and \ntechnical assistance, in particular for human and institutional capacity-building, \nincluding gender-responsive measures, as well as quality, reliable, sustainable and \nresilient infrastructure development of developing countries, with a view to reducing \ntheir institutional bottlenecks and transaction costs and enhancing their commodity \ntrade and development in accordance with national development plans; \n \n19. Also stresses that the Aid for Trade initiative should aim to help developing \ncountries, particularly the least developed countries, to build the supply-side capacity \nand trade-related infrastructure that they need to assist them to implement and benefit \nfrom World Trade Organization agreements and, more broadly, to expand their trade; \n \n20. Recalls the agreement to keep under regular review, by the Ministerial \nConference and appropriate bodies of the World Trade Organization, the impact of \nthe results of the Uruguay Round on the least developed countries as well as on the \nnet food-importing developing countries, with a view to fostering positive measures \nto enable them to achieve their development objectives, and in this regard calls for \nthe implementation of the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning \nthe Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net \nFood-Importing Developing Countries; \n \n21. Encourages developed countries that have not already done so and \ndeveloping countries declaring themselves in a position to do so to take steps towards \nthe goal of realizing timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access \non a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with the Hong Kong \nMinisterial Declaration adopted by the World Trade Organization in 2005; \n \n22.

Notes the important contributions of the Common Fund for Commodities \nand other international commodities organizations, and encourages them, in \ncooperation with the International Trade Centre, the United Nations Conference on \nTrade and Development, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization \nand other relevant bodies, to strengthen coordination among them and to identify and \nimplement innovative measures to enable the sustainable contribution of the \ncommodity sector to economic development, including ways to reduce vulnerability \nto volatility in commodity prices, as well as to enhance activities in developing \ncountries to improve access to markets and the reliability of supply, enhance \ndiversification and the addition of value, improve the competitiveness of \ncommodities, strengthen the market chain, improve market structures, broaden the \nexport base and ensure the effective participation of all stakeholders, on the basis of \na shared understanding of the contribution of commodities to sustainable \ndevelopment; \n \n26. Stresses that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \nand its partners, in the spirit of inter-agency cooperation and multi-stakeholder \npartnerships, within their respective mandates, should continue to engage actively in \ncollaborative research and analysis of the commodity problematique and related \ncapacity- and consensus-building activities, with a view to providing regular analysis \nand policy advice relevant to the sustainable development of commodity-dependent \ndeveloping countries, particularly low-income countries; \n \n27.

Stresses that revenues from commodity production and exports remain \ncritical for developing countries, in particular in the context of the implementation of \nthe 2030 Agenda, given that developing countries need to mobilize resources in order \nto achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and that commodity prices have been \ndecreasing since 2011, which has put pressure on government budgets in developing \ncountries; \n \n32. Invites the President of the General Assembly to hold a one-day informal \ninteractive dialogue of the Assembly on commodity markets during the first half of \n2022 to review world commodity trends and prospects and possible strategies for \neconomic and export diversification, as well as value addition for sustainable \ndevelopment, particularly in commodity-dependent developing countries, with the \naim of sharing experiences and lessons learned, on a date and in a format to be decided \nby the President of the Assembly; \n \n33.
