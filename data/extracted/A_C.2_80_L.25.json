I, resolution 1, annex II. \n\nA/C.2/80/L.25 \n \n25-16741\n2/6 \n \n \nRecognizing that the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing \nStates is consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,5 the Addis \nAbaba Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment,6 the Sevilla Commitment,7 the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change8 and the Paris Agreement,9 as well as the Sendai Framework for \nDisaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030, 10 the New Urban Agenda 11 and the Kunming-\nMontreal Global Biodiversity Framework,12 and that implementation of the Antigua \nand Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States will enable small island \ndeveloping States to make progress towards these agendas,  \n \nReaffirming that small island developing States remain a special case for \nsustainable development due to their unique vulnerability to exogenous shocks owing \nto, inter alia, their small size, geographical remoteness, highly dispersed populations, \nthe limited scale and undiversified nature of their economies, high dependence on \nexternal markets, and extreme exposure to disasters and natural hazards and the \neffects of climate change,  \n \nNoting with concern that, owing in part to their vulnerabilities to the ongoing \nnegative impacts of multiple crises, in particular environmental challenges and \nexternal economic and financial shocks, small island developing States have not \nachieved sustained high levels of economic growth, which has fallen from 4.5 per \ncent to approximately 2.3 per cent in 2023, and their external debt sustainability \ndeteriorated in 2023 as external debt service surged by over 50 per cent year over year \nand public and publicly guaranteed debt service rose by 33.4 per cent year over year, \nwith the ratio of total debt service to export revenues in small island developing States \nrising to 20.3 per cent in 2023 from 12.6 per cent in 2022, and with the liquidity buffer \nof reserves to short-term external debt continuing to decrease, to 133.1 per cent in \n2023 from 152.4 per cent in 2022, in stark contrast to the average from 2000 to 2023 \nof 200.7 per cent, making small island developing States particularly vulnerable to \nexternal financial shocks,  \n \nAcknowledging the need for urgent action to address the adverse impacts of \nclimate change, including those related to sea level rise and extreme weather events, \nwhich continue to pose a significant risk to small island developing States and to their \nefforts to achieve sustainable development, \n \nNoting the importance of oceans, seas and marine resources to small island \ndeveloping States, owing to their unique characteristics, dependence on and particular \nexposure to the ocean and its biodiversity, and noting also the central role of the ocean \nin the culture, livelihoods and sustainable development of the peoples of small island \ndeveloping States,  \n \nNoting with concern the uneven progress towards achieving sustainable \ndevelopment and that, with five years remaining to implement the 2030 Agenda, small \nisland developing States, which are inherently and uniquely vulnerable, are off track \nto achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and therefore reaffirming the \naspiration of small island developing States to achieve a resilient form of prosperity, \nwhere economic growth and well-being are sustained and their economies are robust, \n__________________ \n \n5  Resolution 70/1. \n \n6
