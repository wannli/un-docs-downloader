reduction and management, reduce vulnerability, build \nresilience and responsiveness to natural and human-made hazards and foster \nmitigation of and adaptation to climate change, \n \nNoting with concern that the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon has posed a serious challenge \nto the hard-fought development gains of developing countries, particularly in terms \nof diverting resources from national development plans and programmes,  \n \nConscious of the importance of enhanced concerted efforts by the World \nMeteorological Organization with relevant national, regional and international \nmonitoring centres to deliver, effectively and in a timely manner, more regionally \nfocused climate services as well as training and capacity-building related to the \nEl Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon, and noting the role of the International Research \nCentre on El Ni\u00f1o at Guayaquil, Ecuador, in this regard, \n \nRecalling that the peak of the 2015/16 El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon was comparable in \nstrength to the 1982/83 and 1997/98 events and, therefore, one of the strongest on \nrecord, and affected more than 60 million people during 2015 and 2016, in particular \nin developing countries, with significant short- and long-term impacts on the health \nof individuals, the economy and food production locally, regionally and globally, \nparticularly affecting people whose livelihood depends on agriculture, fisheries and \nlivestock activities, \n \nNoting with concern that, as a consequence of the 2015/16 El Ni\u00f1o \nphenomenon, heavy rains, floods and,

and the number \nof people displaced, affecting food security and infrastructure and hampering the \nability of those countries and peoples to achieve sustainable development, \n \nNoting with appreciation that some countries were able to partly reduce the \nadverse economic, social and environmental impacts of the 2015/16 El Ni\u00f1o \nphenomenon by designing and implementing government-led early action plans that \nincluded the establishment of resilient multipurpose dams and other infrastructure \nprojects, reinforcing existing social and productive infrastructure, revitalizing health \nservices to combat vector-borne diseases, and strengthening social support services, \nsafety nets, appropriate and preventive agriculture practices, income-generating \npublic works and welfare programmes, \n \nAcknowledging the importance of humanitarian assistance provided to countries \nthat were most affected by the adverse effects of the 2015/16 El Ni\u00f1o

effectively address these adverse consequences, \n \nNoting that the World Meteorological Organization has predicted a 70 to \n80 per cent chance of a weak El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation phenomenon prevailing \nduring the winter of 2018/19 and a 55 to 60 per cent chance of its continuing into the \nspring of 2019 to be the most likely scenario, \n \nNoting also the work of the Special Envoys of
