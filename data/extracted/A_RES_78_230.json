Promotion of inclusive and effective international tax cooperation \nat the United Nations \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nGuided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations,  \n \nReiterating the timeliness and importance of strengthening international tax \ncooperation to make it fully inclusive and more effective, both in procedural and \nsubstantive terms, so that Governments may better cooperate in generating financing \nfor development, including through combating illicit financial flows, recovering and \nreturning stolen assets, promoting financial integrity for sustainable development and \nimproving public institutions,  \n \nNoting the corrosive effect that aggressive tax avoidance and tax evasion have \non trust, the social compact, financial integrity, the rule of law and sustainable \ndevelopment, affecting the poorest and most vulnerable, \n \nReaffirming its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa Action \nAgenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, in \nwhich Member States committed to scaling up international tax cooperation, \nencouraged countries, in accordance with their national capacities and circumstances, \nto work together to strengthen transparency and adopt appropriate policies, including \nmultinational enterprises reporting country-by-country to tax authorities where they \noperate, access to beneficial ownership information for competent authorities, and \nprogressively advancing towards automatic exchange of tax information among tax \nauthorities as appropriate, with assistance to developing countries, especially the least \ndeveloped, as needed, and stressed that efforts in international tax cooperation should \n\nA/RES/78/230 \nPromotion of inclusive and effective international tax cooperation \nat the United Nations\n \n23-26269\n2/5 \n \nbe universal in approach and scope and should fully take into account the different \nneeds and capacities of all countries, in particular countries in special situations,  \n \nRecalling its resolution 77/244 of 30 December 2022, in which it decided to \nbegin intergovernmental discussions at United Nations Headquarters on ways to \nstrengthen the inclusiveness and effectiveness of international tax cooperation \nthrough the evaluation of additional options, including the possibility of developing \nan international tax cooperation framework or instrument that is developed and agreed \nupon through a United Nations intergovernmental process, taking into full \nconsideration existing international and multilateral arrangements,  \n \nAcknowledging that increasing the legitimacy, stability, resilience and fairness \nof international tax rules is in the common interest of all relevant stakeholders in tax \nsystems and requires scaling up international tax cooperation by establishing the legal \nbasis for fully inclusive and more effective international tax cooperation in terms of \nsubstance and process, giving due consideration to the value of coherent and \nconsistent international tax rules while also respecting the tax sovereignty of each \nMember State, \n \nRecognizing that respect for tax sovereignty implies international tax \ncooperation that allows all countries to effectively participate in developing the rules, \nby right and without preconditions, and adapt and implement them in accordance with \ntheir needs and preferences, \n \nRecognizing also that inclusive and effective participation in international tax \ncooperation implies that procedures should take into account the different needs, \npriorities and capacities of all countries to meaningfully contribute to the norm-\nsetting processes, without undue restrictions, and support them in doing so, including \ngiving them an opportunity to participate in agenda-setting, debates and decision-\nmaking, either directly or through country groupings, according to their preference,  \n \nRecognizing further that inclusiveness in international tax cooperation also \ninvolves capacity-building and support to developing countries so that they can \neffectively participate in the full range of international tax cooperation in an equitable \nmanner, while stressing that capacity-building efforts should fully take into account \nthe needs and priorities of developing countries,  \n \nRecognizing that agenda-setting is an important procedural aspect because the \nway in which tax challenges requiring collective action are identified and framed \noften predetermines the scope and nature of the responses to these challenges, as well \nas the order of priority for dealing with them,  \n \nStressing that a fully inclusive and effective international tax cooperation \nrequires well-established and transparent decision-making structures, and clear and \ntransparent rules, in order to ensure that all participants are on an equal footing \nprocedurally and have the same ability to engage meaningfully in decision-making, \nas well as clear and cohesive multilateral rules to aid countries and businesses and to \nprevent opportunities for tax avoidance,  \n \nRecognizing that an inclusive and effective international tax cooperation system \nrequires robust processes for preventing and resolving tax disputes in an effective \nmanner, and keeping in mind that developing countries have limited resources to \nhandle costly international dispute settlement processes,  \n \nRecognizing also the important role of taxation to close the sustainable \ndevelopment financing gap, which requires actions at all levels, international, \nregional and national, and on many fronts, including corporate tax, personal income \ntax, consumption taxes such as value-added taxes, strengthened and digitalized tax \nadministrations and effective taxation of extractives,  \n\nPromotion of inclusive and effective international tax cooperation \nat the United Nations \nA/RES/78/230\n \n3/5\n23-26269 \n \n \nEmphasizing that international tax rules must respond to the needs, priorities \nand capacities of all countries and appropriately address the ways in which modern \nmarkets operate and business is done, as part of a major overhaul of the international \nfinancial architecture,  \n \nEmphasizing also that a United Nations intergovernmental process for tax-norm \nshaping and rule-setting, with full consideration of existing multilateral and \ninternational arrangements, would leverage existing strengths and address gaps and \nweaknesses in current international tax cooperation efforts and arrangements,  \n \nNoting that its resolution 69/313 also commits Member States to working to \nimprove the fairness, transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of their tax systems,  \n \nRecognizing the need for all countries to work together to eliminate tax evasion, \ntax base erosion and profit shifting and to ensure that all taxpayers, especially \nmultinational companies and transnational corporations, pay taxes to the Governments \nof countries where economic activity occurs, value is created and from where revenues \nare generated, in accordance with national and international laws and policies,  \n \nNoting that the implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development may be further supported by additional \ndomestic resource mobilization,  \n \nNoting also the work of the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation \nin Tax Matters and the 2023 special meeting of the Economic and Social Council on \ninternational cooperation in tax matters,  \n \nNoting further the work of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment/Group of 20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting \nand the subsequent ongoing work on the two-pillar solution, noting that it facilitates \ncollaboration for tackling tax avoidance and improving the coherence of international \ntax rules, \n \nNoting the implementation of the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial \nAccount Information in Tax Matters under a common reporting standard developed \nby the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, as well as the role \nof the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes,  \n \nNoting also the work of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment on establishing value-added tax guidelines in the context of e-commerce \nand the bilateral and multilateral technical assistance programmes provided to \ncountries in support of their implementation,  \n \nNoting further that expert assessments suggest that an increase in the tax-to-\ngross domestic product ratio could also be feasible for low-income developing \ncountries and emerging market economies through a combination of tax system \nreform and institutional capacity-building, \n \nRecalling the work of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax, which is to \nintensify collaboration and coordination on tax issues between the United Nations, \nthe International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group and the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development,  \n \nNoting the work and collaboration between the United Nations Development \nProgramme and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in the \njoint Tax Inspectors Without Borders programmes, and stressing that similar efforts \nshould be strengthened,  \n \nRecognizing the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 commitment to continue cooperation \ntowards a globally fair, sustainable and modern international tax system appropriate \nto the needs of the twenty-first century during their summit held in New Delhi on 9 \n\nA/RES/78/230 \nPromotion of inclusive and effective international tax cooperation \nat the United Nations\n \n23-26269\n4/5 \n \nand 10 September 2023, and noting the accession of the African Union as a permanent \nmember of the Group of 20 during the same summit,  \n \nNoting the work of the Addis Tax Initiative in fostering collective action to \nstrengthen the capacities of developing countries for closing recognized gaps in \ndevelopment finance,  \n \nNoting also the work of the African Union, in collaboration with other \npan-African institutions, in promoting international cooperation to fight illicit \nfinancial flows, including the decision by the Assembly of the African Union at its \nthirty-sixth ordinary session, held in Addis Ababa on 18 and 19 February 2023, to \ncurb illicit financial flows that drain substantial financial resources from Africa that \ncould otherwise be employed for economic and social development,  \n \nNoting the recent creation of the Regional Platform for Tax Cooperation in Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean with the purpose of contributing to the collective search \nfor solutions to the key fiscal issues of developing countries and of achieving \nequitable tax policies that are conducive to growth, the reduction of inequalities and \nthe financing of the Sustainable Development Goals,  \n \nRecalling the commitment of Member States under the Addis Ababa Action \nAgenda to redouble efforts to substantially reduce illicit financial flows by 2030, with \na view to eventually eliminating them, including by combating tax evasion and \ncorruption through strengthened national regulation and increased international \ncooperation,  \n \nRecommitting to strengthening the capacities of revenue administrations, and \ncalling upon the international community to scale up support for related \ntechnological, institutional and human capacity-building to countries and to explore \ndigitalization as a tool to optimize the efficiency of tax systems,  \n \nTaking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the promotion of inclusive \nand effective international tax cooperation at the United
