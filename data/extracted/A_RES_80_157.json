early childhood, older \npersons, Indigenous Peoples, local communities, persons with disabilities, as well as \nof those living in vulnerable situations, \n \nRecognizing that infant and young child mortality can be reduced through the \nimproved nutritional status of women of reproductive age, especially during \npregnancy, and that exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life is optimal \nfor child survival and nutrition and the promotion of health and cognitive \ndevelopment, as well as an important principle of healthy diets, including through \ncontinued breastfeeding until 2 years of age and beyond combined with appropriate \nnutritious complementary feeding, and highlighting that despite the steady progress \nmade with regard to exclusive breastfeeding, with 48 per cent of infants under \n6 months of age exclusively breastfed worldwide in 2023, immense efforts will be \nrequired to meet the global nutrition targets of the 2030 Agenda and that even this \nindicator requires accelerated progress,  \n \nRemaining deeply concerned that, according to the most recent estimates of the \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for \nAgricultural Development, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the World Food \nProgramme and the World Health Organization, between 638 million and 720 million \npeople may have faced hunger in 2024, corresponding to 7.8 and 8.8 per cent of the \nglobal population, and that among children under 5 years of age, as at 2024, an \nestimated 150.2 million (23.2 per cent) were stunted and 42.8 million (6.6 per cent) \nwere wasted, and that the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity has \nremained unchanged for four consecutive years at the global level, with an estimated \n28.0 per cent of the global population, or 2.3 billion people, moderately or severely \nfood-insecure in 2024, and that global nutrition challenges are increasingly complex \nas multiple forms of malnutrition, including stunting, wasting, underweight, \nmicronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity, may coexist within the same \ncountry or household, with about 2.6 billion people in the world unable to afford a \nhealthy diet in 2024,31 \n \nRecalling that the Sustainable Development Goals and targets are integrated and \nindivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development, economic, \nsocial and environmental, and expressing deep concern that, past the midpoint of the \nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda, the world is still far from achieving Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 2, that, at the current pace and scope of implementation, it is \nunlikely to promote the transformational change required and that many parts of the

calling for \nadditional efforts to support the transformational change needed, \n \nRecognizing that economic downturns, gender inequalities, conflicts, \nbiodiversity loss, drought and the adverse effects of climate change, including more \nfrequent and extreme weather events, are among the key factors contributing to a \nreversal in the long-term progress in fighting global hunger, making the prospect of \nending hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 more difficult,  \n \nNoting that increasing urbanization, with almost 7 in 10 people projected to live \nin cities by 2050, is driving changes in agrifood systems across the rural-urban \ncontinuum, that these changes represent both challenges and opportunities to ending \nhunger, food insecurity and malnutrition and ensuring that everyone has access to \naffordable healthy diets, and that, globally, food insecurity and malnutrition is higher \nin rural areas than in urban areas, with 32.0 per cent of rural populations experiencing \nfood insecurity and malnutrition in 2024 compared with 23.9 per cent of urban \npopulations,32 \n \nNoting with concern the rise of food and agricultural input prices, including \nfertilizer prices, and the shortages of food and fertilizers caused by supply chain \ndisruptions, affecting crop yields and threatening future agricultural productivity and \nproduction, as well as
