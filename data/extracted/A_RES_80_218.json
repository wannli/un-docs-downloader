while respecting the principle of \nnon\u2011refoulement,  \n \nBearing in mind the obligations of States under international law, as applicable, \nto exercise due diligence to prevent crimes targeting migrants and to investigate and \npunish perpetrators, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the \nenjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of victims,  \n

situations of vulnerability,  \n \nTaking note of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of \nmigrants,18 which examines the externalization of migration governance and expresses \nconcern about the human rights of migrants being particularly vulnerable to violation \namid this growing practice, and thus noting the importance of ensuring the human \nrights and safety of migrants during this practice, which transfers migration control, \nasylum processing and readmission to third countries, by complying with \ninternational obligations, \n \nReaffirming its commitment

impact on the fulfilment of human rights globally,  \n \nStressing the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants \nregardless of their migration status, including when implementing their specific \nmigration and border security policies, and expressing its concern at measures which, \nincluding in the context of policies aimed at reducing irregular migration, treat \nirregular migration as a criminal rather than an administrative offence, where the \neffect of doing so is to deny migrants the full enjoyment of their human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, and in this regard recalling that sanctions and the treatment \ngiven to irregular migrants should be commensurate with their offences, \n \nAware that, as criminals take advantage of migratory flows and attempt to \ncircumvent restrictive immigration policies and border controls, migrants become \nmore vulnerable to, inter alia, kidnapping, extortion, forced labour, sexual \nexploitation, physical assault, debt bondage and abandonment,  \n \nAware also that employing border governance policies that do not respect human \nrights and are in violation of a State\u2019s obligations under international law, and that are \nfailing to combat widespread impunity for those who violate the human rights of \nmigrants, contributes to limit pathways for safe, orderly and regular migration, and \ncan contribute to the death or disappearance of migrants, particularly those in \nvulnerable situations,  \n \nConcerned that migrant children, including those who are unaccompanied or \nseparated from their parents or primary caregivers, are particularly vulnerable along \ntheir migration journey, and reaffirming the commitment to protecting the rights of \nthe child and upholding the principle of the best

civil society, \nincluding non\u2011governmental organizations, workers\u2019 organizations and the private \nsector, among other relevant stakeholders, to undertake information campaigns aimed \nat clarifying opportunities, limitations, laws, risks and rights in the event of migration \nin order to enable everyone to make informed decisions and to prevent anyone from \nutilizing irregular or dangerous means to cross international borders,  \n \n1. \nCalls upon States to promote and protect effectively the human rights and \nfundamental freedoms of all migrants, regardless of their migration status, especially \nthose of women and children and persons with disabilities, and to address \ninternational migration through international, regional or bilateral cooperation and \ndialogue and a comprehensive and balanced approach, recognizing the roles and \nresponsibilities of countries of origin, transit and destination in promoting and \nprotecting the human rights of all migrants and ensuring that their legislation and \nmigration policies and practices are consistent with their applicable international \nhuman rights obligations, in order to avoid approaches that might aggravate their \nvulnerability;  \n \n2. \nExpresses its concern about the impacts of financial and economic crises, \nas well as natural disasters and the adverse effects of climate change, on international \nmigration and migrants, and in that regard urges Governments to combat \n\nA/RES/80/218 \nProtection of migrants\n \n25-20973\n6/13 \n \ndiscriminatory treatment of migrants, in

\nStrongly condemns acts, manifestations and expressions of racism, racial \ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against migrants and the \nstereotypes often applied to them, including on the basis of religion or belief, and \nurges States to apply and, where needed, to reinforce existing laws and provide \neffective remedy to victims when such acts against migrants occur, including by \nestablishing or strengthening mechanisms which allow migrants to report alleged \ncases of abuse by relevant authorities and employers without fear of reprisal, in order \nto eradicate impunity for perpetrators; \n \n(b) \nExpresses concern about legislation adopted by some States that results in \nmeasures and practices that may restrict the human rights and fundamental freedoms \nof migrants, and reaffirms that, when exercising their sovereign right to enact and \nimplement migratory and border security measures, States have the duty to comply \nwith their obligations under

migration status, in conformity with the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights and the international instruments to which they are \nParty, and therefore:  \n \n(a) \nCalls upon all States to respect the human rights and inherent dignity of \nmigrants, to put an end to arbitrary arrest and detention and, bearing in mind the New \nYork Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, to review policies that deny migrants \nthe full enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, to pursue \nalternatives to detention while assessments of migration status are under way and to \ntake into account measures that have been successfully implemented by some States; \n\nProtection of migrants \nA/RES/80/218\n \n7/13\n25-20973 \n \n \n(b) \nEncourages States to put in place, if they have

that States must ensure that their returning nationals are duly received; \n \n(h) \nCalls upon States to analyse and implement, where appropriate, \nmechanisms for the safe and orderly administration
