individual and public health-related, social and safety \nproblems resulting from the abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, in \nparticular among children and young people, and drug-related crime, and reaffirming \nits determination to prevent and treat the abuse of such substances and prevent and \ncounter their illicit cultivation, production, manufacturing and trafficking, \n \nReaffirming that the three international drug control conventions seek to achieve \na balance between ensuring access to and the availability of narcotic drugs and \npsychotropic substances under international control for medical and scientific \npurposes and preventing their diversion and misuse, \n \nNoting with deep concern that the availability of internationally controlled drugs \nfor medical and scientific purposes, including for the relief of pain and suffering, \nremains low to non-existent in many countries, in particular in developing countries, \nand highlighting the need to enhance national efforts and international cooperation at \nall levels to address that situation by promoting measures to ensure their availability, \naffordability and accessibility for medical and scientific purposes, within the \nframework of national legal systems, while simultaneously preventing their diversion, \nabuse and trafficking, in order to fulfil the aims and objectives of the three \ninternational drug control conventions, \n \nStressing with grave concern the increase in the number of overdose deaths \nassociated with the use of synthetic drugs, and the urgent need to raise awareness of \nand improve access to the prevention and treatment of drug overdose, \n \nUnderscoring the need for Member States, consistent with their national \nlegislation and contexts, to facilitate non-discriminatory and voluntary access to drug-\nrelated prevention, treatment, education, care, sustained recovery, rehabilitation, \nsocial reintegration and related support services, in particular for people who may \nface obstacles when accessing those services, including those impacted by social \nmarginalization, while mainstreaming a gender perspective in the development and \nimplementation of those services, \n \nRecognizing that civil society, as well as the scientific community and academia, \nplay an important role in addressing and countering all aspects of the world drug \nproblem, and noting that affected populations and representatives of civil society \nentities, where appropriate, should be enabled to play a participatory role in the \nformulation, implementation, and the providing of relevant scientific evidence in \nsupport of, as appropriate, the evaluation of drug control policies and programmes, \nand recognizing the importance of cooperation with the private sector in this regard, \n \nTaking note of the publication of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \nWorld Drug Report 2023, in particular its chapter entitled \u201cThe synthetic drug \nphenomenon,\u201d and noting with concern its findings that synthetic drugs are \nproliferating globally and offer criminals, including organized crime groups, \nsignificant advantages with regard to the scalability of manufacturing, operational \ncosts, geographic flexibility and reduced risks of detection, interdiction and \nprosecution, that consumers of synthetic drugs face growing challenges related to the \nunknown pharmacology and harms of such drugs, lack of available treatments, \ntherapies or antagonists for some new drugs, the potential development of an \nunderground and unsafe market for such therapies, with the inherent risks of misuse \nand abuse of an unregulated practice, and increasingly dangerous mixtures of harmful \nsubstances in the drug supply, and also that developments in digital communications \nplatforms have added a new dimension to drug distribution, including the use of the \nclear web, encrypted communications tools, certain social media applications, and \ndarknet markets, \n\nA/RES/78/131 \nEnhancing action at the national, regional and international levels \nto address the global public
