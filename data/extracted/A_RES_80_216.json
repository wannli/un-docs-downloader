I, Resolutions Adopted by the Conference (United Nations publication, \nSales No. E.93.I.8 and corrigendum), resolution 1, annex I. \n\nA/RES/80/216 \nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation\n \n25-20968\n4/9 \n \nnumber of people practising open defecation decreased from 715 million to 354 million \nduring this period, \n \nDeeply concerned that, more than 15 years after the adoption of resolution \n64/292, 2.1 billion people lack safely managed drinking water and 3.4 billion people \nlack safely managed sanitation, including 1.7 billion people without basic sanitation \nservices at home, which represents a global human rights and development challenge, \nand that achieving universal coverage by 2030 will require a substantial increase in \ncurrent global rates of progress pursued within a guiding framework aimed at the full \nrealization of human rights, \n \nDeeply concerned also that pandemics exacerbate existing inequalities, and that \nthose disproportionately at risk are women, girls and persons in vulnerable situations, \nrecognizing the need to expand as a matter of utmost urgency access to adequate water \nand sanitation services, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, and \nto ensure continued access to existing services in this regard, including sexual and \nreproductive healthcare services, and gravely concerned that as of 2023 2.3 billion \npeople worldwide lacked basic hand-washing facilities at home, which are urgently \nneeded to prevent the spread of pandemics and other infectious diseases, \n \nDeeply concerned further about the lack of access to adequate water and \nsanitation services and its dramatic consequences for the overall health situation in \nhumanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of conflict and natural \ndisaster, and acknowledging that people living in countries affected by armed conflict \nand natural disasters and in countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of \nclimate change, as well as people living in refugee camps, including in refugee host \ncountries, are more likely to lack access to basic drinking water and to basic sanitation \nthan people living in unaffected countries, while acknowledging the efforts of refugee \nhost countries in improving the situation of people living in refugee camps, \n \nDeeply concerned that women and girls often face, especially in humanitarian \nemergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural disaster, \nparticular barriers in accessing water and sanitation and hygiene services, as well as \nmenstrual health and hygiene management, and that they shoulder the main burden of \ncollecting household water and of care responsibilities, including those arising from \nwaterborne diseases, in many parts of the world, restricting their time for other \nactivities, such as education and leisure, or, for women, for earning a livelihood, \n \nDeeply concerned also that achieving universal and equitable access to safe \nwater and sanitation services by 2030 will require up to a sixfold increase in current \nrates of progress, \n \nDeeply alarmed by indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting \ncivilian objects in armed conflict, which may injure personnel and damage civilian \ninfrastructure that are critical to the delivery of essential services to the civilian \npopulation, \n \nDeeply alarmed also that water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases hit \nchildren the hardest, while noting that child diarrhoea remains a leading cause of \ndeath in children under 5 years of age, and underscoring that progress on reducing \nchild mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children\u2019s and women\u2019s universal \nand equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation and that, in humanitarian \nemergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural disaster, \nchildren suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, \n \nDeeply concerned that persons with disabilities, especially children, often lack \nuniversal and equitable access to safe and sustainably managed drinking water and \nsanitation and face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities that are \n\nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation \nA/RES/80/216\n \n5/9\n25-20968 \n \naccessible and appropriate to their needs, which has an impact on their ability to live \nindependently and participate fully in all aspects of life, including education and \nemployment, which is particularly concerning in situations of homelessness and \nhumanitarian emergencies and crises, \n \nDeeply concerned also that widespread silence, stigma, misconceptions and \ntaboos surrounding menstruation and menstrual health and hygiene mean that women \nand girls often lack basic information and education thereon, whether in school or out \nof school, and are excluded and stigmatized, that the enjoyment of their human rights, \nincluding the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and \nmental health, can be negatively affected and that they are thus prevented from \nrealizing their full potential, \n \nDeeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation \nservices, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, especially in \nschools and other educational settings, workplaces, health centres and public facilities \nand at home, negatively affects gender equality, the empowerment of women and girls \nand their enjoyment of human rights, including the right to education and the right to \nthe enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and \nrecognizing the specific hygiene needs of women and girls during menstruation, and \nthat women have specific hygiene needs during pregnancy, childbearing and rearing \nand throughout the life course, \n \nDeeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed \nto attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their \nsafety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities \noutside their homes or, when lacking adequate sanitation facilities, practising open \ndefecation and urination, limiting their ability to move freely and safely in the public \nsphere, \n \nDeeply concerned also that non\u2011existent or inadequate sanitation facilities and \nserious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can negatively \naffect water provision and sustainable access to safe drinking water and that, \naccording to the United Nations World Water Development Report 2021, an estimated \n80 per cent of the world\u2019s wastewater is released into the environment without \ntreatment, \n \nAffirming the importance of regional and international cooperation, where \nappropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to \nsafe drinking water and sanitation, with the understanding that it has no bearing on \nthe issues of international water law, including international watercourse law, \n \nExpressing concern that climate change increases the frequency and intensity of \nsudden-onset natural disasters, extreme weather events and slow-onset events, and \nthat these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, \nincluding the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and recalling the \nneed to accelerate action on mitigation, enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen \nresilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change, including through adopting a \nsustainable and integrated approach to resilient water and sanitation systems and \nwater management implemented within a guiding framework aimed at the full \nrealization of human rights, \n \nNoting that adequate responses to the adverse impacts of climate change and the \nprogressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are \nlinked to the health and sustainability of ecosystems, including aquatic ecosystems, \nwhich are also endangered by overexploitation and increasing levels of pollution, \n\nA/RES/80/216 \nThe human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation\n \n25-20968\n6/9 \n \n \nRecalling the commitment to step up efforts on all fronts to tackle \ndesertification, land degradation, erosion and drought, biodiversity loss and water \nscarcity, which are seen as major environmental, economic and social challenges for \nglobal sustainable development and for the realization of the human rights to safe \ndrinking water and sanitation, \n \nRecognizing that, while the implications of climate change-related impacts and \nenvironmental damage for the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water \nand sanitation affect individuals and communities around the world, the consequences \nare felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable \nsituations, such as people living in informal settlements, people living in small island \nStates and rural and local communities, and recognizing also that Indigenous Peoples, \nbecause of their specific situation and nature, may be among the first to face the direct \nconsequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close \nrelationship with the environment and its resources, \n \n1. \nReaffirms that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as \ncomponents of the right to an adequate standard of living, are essential for the full \nenjoyment of the right to life and all human rights; \n \n2. \nAlso reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles \neveryone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, \nphysically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the \nhuman right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical \nand affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, \nsocially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while \nreaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of \nliving; \n \n3. \nTakes note with appreciation of the work of the Special Rapporteur on the \nhuman rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and invites him to work, within \nhis mandate,17 to collaborate and engage with Member States and other stakeholders, \nincluding civil society, in achieving the internationally agreed water-related goals and \ntargets; \n \n4. \nWelcomes the appointment of the first Special Envoy on Water of the \nSecretary-General and takes note of the publication of the United Nations System-\nwide Strategy for Water and Sanitation in 2024; \n \n5. \nCalls upon States: \n \n(a) \nTo ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking \nwater and sanitation for all in a non\u2011discriminatory manner while eliminating \ninequalities in access, including for individuals belonging to groups at risk and those \nwho are marginalized on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, \nreligion and national or social origin or on any other grounds; \n \n(b) \nTo prioritize as a matter of urgency the provision of safe drinking water \nand sanitation services that are accessible to all, including persons in vulnerable \nsituations, especially in densely populated, impoverished and rural areas, as a means \nof enhancing pandemic preparedness and preventing the spread of infectious diseases; \n \n(c) \nTo protect and restore water-related ecosystems and prioritize, as \nappropriate, in their water management policies, the human rights to safe drinking \nwater and sanitation for all, in particular those affected by lack of access to safe and \nadequate water and sanitation due to poverty or water scarcity; \n_______________ \n \n17 Human Rights Council resolution 60/9. \n\nThe human rights to safe drinking water and

all women and girls for preparedness in \nhumanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural \ndisaster, by ensuring access to water and sanitation services and implementing gender-\nresponsive policies, plans and programmes that address, inter alia, effective menstrual \nhealth and hygiene management and adequate disposal options for menstrual \nproducts, without compromising their rights, safety and dignity; \n \n(h) \nTo address the widespread stigma, shame and discrimination surrounding \nmenstruation, menstrual health and menstrual hygiene by promoting educational and \nhealth practices in and out of schools in order to foster a culture in which menstruation \nis recognized as healthy and natural and by ensuring access to factual information \nthereon, including for men and boys, addressing the negative social norms around the \nissue, as well as ensuring universal access to hygienic products and gender-sensitive \nfacilities, including disposal and waste management options for menstrual products, \nwhile recognizing that women\u2019s and girls\u2019 attendance at school, university or, for \nwomen, work can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of \nmeans to maintain personal hygiene, such as safe water, sanitation and hygiene \nfacilities in schools, public places and, for women, the workplace; \n \n(i) \nTo promote both women\u2019s leadership and their full, effective and equal \nparticipation in decision-making on water and sanitation management and to ensure \nthat a gender-based

longer distances and wait in \nlong queues, including through promoting safe public spaces and improving the \nsecurity and safety of women and girls through gender-responsive rural and urban \nplanning and infrastructure, as well as through their meaningful participation in \nplanning processes; \n_______________ \n \n18 See resolution 70/1. \n \n19 Resolution 71/256, annex.
