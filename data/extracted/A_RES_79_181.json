they and their family members are ageing \nand there is no time to lose, expressing grave concern at the long years of severe \nsuffering experienced by abductees and their families as a result of their forced \nseparation, and the lack of any concrete or positive action by the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea, notably since the investigations on all the Japanese nationals \ncommenced on the basis of the government-level consultations held between the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and Japan in May 2014 and the identical and \nnon-substantive replies by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to the \nnumerous communications transmitted by the Working Group on Enforced or \nInvoluntary Disappearances and the Working Group on Arbitrary

importance of the issue of separated families, \nincluding affected Koreans worldwide, and in this regard urging the resumption of \nthe reunions of separated families, considering the advanced age of

Republic of Korea funds \nits unlawful nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes through human rights \nviolations and abuse, such as forced labour, and noting with concern that a \ndisproportionate amount of the State budget is allocated to military spending, \nresulting in failure to fully respect, protect and fulfil human rights, such as the right \nto adequate food as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and the \nright to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, \n \nNoting indications of a gradual reopening of the country\u2019s borders after the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and calling for the return on a \nnon-discriminatory basis of the diplomatic community, agencies, funds and

\n \n(iii) Enforced and involuntary disappearances of persons by arrest, detention \nor abduction against their will; refusal to disclose the fate and whereabouts of \nthe persons concerned; and refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their \nliberty, which places such persons subjected thereto outside the protection of \nthe law and which has had the effect of inflicting severe suffering on them and \ntheir families;
