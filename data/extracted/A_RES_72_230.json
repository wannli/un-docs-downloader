forms, \nincluding North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation, that is well aligned \nwith national priorities to contribute to addressing the development needs of middle-\nincome countries,

the potential to undermine progress towards achieving the internationally \nagreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, and \nthreaten debt sustainability in many countries, especially developing countries,  \n \nReiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind, reaffirming the \nrecognition that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, and the wish to see \nthe Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society, \nand recommitting to endeavour to reach the furthest behind first, \n \nRecommitting to ensuring that no

complement to, and not a substitute for, North-\nSouth cooperation, and in this regard calls upon the United Nations development \nsystem to continue its ongoing efforts to mainstream support to
