Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly,  \n \nConvinced that the use of nuclear weapons poses the most serious threat to the \nsurvival of humankind,  \n \nBearing in mind the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of \n8 July 1996 on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons, 1 \n \nConvinced that a multilateral, universal and binding agreement prohibiting the \nuse or threat of use of nuclear weapons would contribute to the elimination of the \nnuclear threat and to the climate for negotiations leading to the ultimate elimination \nof nuclear weapons, thereby strengthening international peace and security,  \n \nConscious that some steps have been taken by the Russian Federation and the \nUnited States of America towards a reduction of their nuclear weapons and that \nfurther steps \u2013 in all relevant formats \u2013 on nuclear arms control and disarmament \ncan contribute to the improvement of the international climate and the goal of the \ncomplete elimination of nuclear weapons,  \n \nRecalling that in paragraph 58 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special \nSession of the General Assembly2 it is stated that all States should actively participate \nin efforts to bring about conditions in international relations among States in which \na code of peaceful conduct of nations in international affairs could be agreed upon \nand which would preclude the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,  \n \nReaffirming that any use of nuclear weapons would be a violation of the \nCharter of the United Nations and a crime against humanity, as declared in its \nresolutions 1653 (XVI) of 24 November 1961, 33/71 B of 14 December 1978, \n34/83 G of 11 December 1979, 35/152 D of 12 December 1980 and 36/92 I of \n9 December 1981,  \n__________________ \n \n1 A/51/218, annex. \n \n2  Resolution S-10/2. \n\nA/RES/72/59 \nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons\n \n17-21746 \n2/2 \n \n \nRecognizing that a legally binding prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons is \nnot contrary to but in fact contributes to international efforts for the achievement \nand maintenance of a world free of nuclear weapons, \n \nStressing that an international convention on the prohibition of the use of \nnuclear weapons would be an important step in a phased programme towards the \ncomplete elimination of nuclear weapons, with a specified framework of time,  \n \nNoting with regret that the Conference on Disarmament, during its 2016 \nsession, was unable to undertake negotiations on this subject as called for in \nGeneral Assembly resolution 70/62 of 7 December 2015,  \n \n1. \nReiterates its request to the Conference on Disarmament to commence \nnegotiations in order to reach agreement on an international convention prohibiting \nthe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances;  \n \n2. \nRequests the Conference on Disarmament to report to the General \nAssembly on the results of those negotiations. \n \n62nd plenary meeting  \n4 December 2017 \n \n",
