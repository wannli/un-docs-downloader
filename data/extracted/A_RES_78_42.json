plans by the nuclear-weapon States to expand, modernize and qualitatively \nimprove nuclear arsenals, the disregard of negative security assurances, as well as \nplans by the nuclear-weapon States and States under extended nuclear security \nguarantees to maintain or increase the role of nuclear weapons in security doctrines, \nincluding with regard to the placement of nuclear weapons on the territory of \nnon-nuclear-weapon States, all of which contribute to the erosion of the disarmament \nand non-proliferation regime and undermine the achievement of a nuclear-weapon-\nfree world,  \n \nAlarmed that recent international tensions have taken an increasing nuclear \ndimension, particularly with regard to threats to use nuclear weapons and increasingly \nstrident nuclear rhetoric,  \n \nConcerned \nabout \nother \nactions \nthat \nweaken \nthe \ndisarmament \nand \nnon-proliferation architecture and undermine key norms, such as the dismantling of \ncore agreements among the

Strategic Offensive Arms (New \nSTART Treaty),  \n \nRecalling the joint statement on preventing nuclear war and avoiding arms races \nissued by China, France, the Russian Federation, the United

elimination of their \nnuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disarmament, in accordance with commitments \nmade under article VI of the Treaty,  \n \nEver mindful that, to preserve the credibility and strength of the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, nuclear-weapon States must implement their \nrespective obligations and commitments under the Treaty and therefore redress the \nimbalance in implementation with regard to non-nuclear-weapon States,  \n \nDeeply concerned by the successive failures of the two previous Review \nConferences of the Parties to the Treaty, and
