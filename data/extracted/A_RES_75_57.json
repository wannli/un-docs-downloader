Reducing nuclear danger \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nBearing in mind that the use of nuclear weapons poses the most serious threat \nto humankind and to the survival of civilization, \n \nReaffirming that any use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would constitute a \nviolation of the Charter of the United Nations, \n \nConvinced that the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects would \nseriously enhance the danger of nuclear war, \n \nConvinced also that nuclear disarmament and the complete elimination of \nnuclear weapons are essential to remove the danger of nuclear war, \n \nConsidering that, until nuclear weapons cease to exist, it is imperative on the \npart of the nuclear-weapon States to adopt measures that assure non-nuclear-weapon \nStates against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, \n \nConsidering also that the hair-trigger alert of nuclear weapons carries \nunacceptable risks of unintentional or accidental use of nuclear weapons, which \nwould have catastrophic consequences for all humankind, \n \nEmphasizing the need to adopt measures to avoid accidental, unauthorized or \nunexplained incidents arising from computer anomalies or other technical \nmalfunctions, \n \nConscious that limited steps relating to de-alerting and de-targeting have been \ntaken by the nuclear-weapon States and that further practical, realistic and mutually \nreinforcing steps are necessary to contribute to the improvement in the international \nclimate for negotiations leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons, \n\nA/RES/75/57 \nReducing nuclear danger\n \n20-16872\n2/2 \n \n \nMindful that a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in the security policies of \nnuclear-weapon States would have a positive impact on international peace and \nsecurity and improve the conditions for the further reduction and the elimination of \nnuclear weapons, \n \nReiterating the highest priority accorded to nuclear disarmament in the Final \nDocument of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly1 and by the \ninternational community, \n \nRecalling the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the \nlegality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons2 that there exists an obligation for all \nStates to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear \ndisarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control, \n \nRecalling also the call, in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, 3 to seek \nto eliminate the dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction and the resolve to \nstrive for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear \nweapons, including the possibility of convening an international conference to \nidentify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers, \n \n1. \nCalls for a review of nuclear doctrines and, in this context, immediate and \nurgent steps to reduce the risks of unintentional and accidental use of nuclear \nweapons, including through de-alerting and de-targeting nuclear weapons; \n \n2. \nRequests the five nuclear-weapon States to take measures towards the \nimplementation of paragraph 1 above; \n \n3. \nCalls upon Member States to take the measures necessary to prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects and to promote nuclear \ndisarmament, with the objective of eliminating nuclear weapons; \n \n4. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to \nparagraph 5 of its resolution 74/44 of 12 December 2019;4 \n \n5. \nRequests the Secretary-General to intensify efforts and support initiatives \nthat would contribute to the full implementation of the seven recommendations \nidentified in the report of the Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters that would \nsignificantly reduce the risk of nuclear war,5 and also to continue to encourage \nMember States to consider the convening of an international conference, as proposed \nin the United Nations Millennium Declaration, to identify ways of eliminating nuclear \ndangers, and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session; \n \n6. \nDecides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-sixth session, \nunder the item entitled \u201cGeneral and complete disarmament\u201d, the sub-item entitled \n\u201cReducing nuclear danger\u201d. \n \n37th plenary meeting \n7 December 2020 \n \n__________________ \n \n1 Resolution S-10/2. \n \n2 A/51/218, annex. \n \n3 Resolution 55/2. \n \n4 A/75/138. \n \n5 A/56/400, para. 3. \n",
