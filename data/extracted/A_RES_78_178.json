social integration through social inclusion\n \n23-25998\n2/8 \n \n \nWelcoming the fact that the 2030 Agenda reflects the cross-cutting nature and \nimportance of social inclusion, through the relevant Sustainable Development Goals \nand associated targets, and acknowledging that its promotion is required to achieve \nsustainable development in all its dimensions, \n \nReiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind, reaffirming the \nrecognition that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, and the wish to see \nthe Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples

concerned also that a slowdown in the reduction of poverty rates since \n2015, despite some signs of early progress around the time that the 2030 Agenda was \nadopted, was aggravated by the devasting economic and social consequences of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, leading to an increase in the number of people living in extreme \npoverty for the first time in a generation, reversing three decades of steady progress, \n \nDeeply concerned further, in this regard, that poverty persists in all countries of \nthe world, regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, and is \nparticularly severe in developing countries, and that it extends to and manifests itself \nin, among other things, social exclusion, hunger, discrimination, the feminization of \npoverty, vulnerability to trafficking in persons and disease, lack of adequate shelter, \nlack of access to basic services, illiteracy and hopelessness, \n \nAcknowledging the need to develop a multidimensional perspective of poverty \nthat is not limited to economic deprivation but also takes into account social inequities \nand the fact that a person\u2019s disadvantages in one or more areas can exacerbate the \ndetrimental and cumulative impacts of other disadvantages, and recognizing that \nmeasures of multidimensional poverty account not only for insufficient income, but \nalso

\nnational and international policies and national development strategies, including \ninequality and poverty reduction strategies, and reaffirming that employment creation \nand decent work for all should be incorporated into macroeconomic policies, taking \nfully into account the impact and social dimension of globalization, the benefits and \ncosts of which are often unevenly shared and distributed, \n \nRecognizing that the three core themes of social development, namely, poverty \neradication, full and productive employment and decent work for all and social \nintegration, are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, and that an enabling environment \ntherefore needs to be created so that all three objectives can be pursued simultaneously, \n \nReaffirming its resolution

that women often make up a large portion of the workforce in self-\nemployment and part-time or temporary work and continue to bear most of the \nresponsibility for unpaid care work, having, as a result, lower rates of labour force \nparticipation and shorter formal working careers, which limits their ability to \ncontribute to social security entitlements, and noting in this regard that mechanisms \nto build social protection over their life course, including care and support systems, \ncan help to address this situation, \n \nReaffirming the importance of ensuring the social
