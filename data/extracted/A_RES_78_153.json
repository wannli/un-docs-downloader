\n7/13\n23-25901 \n \ninclusive and sustainable economies and societies, in this regard stresses the need to \nstrengthen the global response to climate change by increasing the ability of countries \nto adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, fostering resilience, accelerating the \nfull implementation of all the Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda and integrating \nclimate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning, urges parties \nto the Paris Agreement to communicate or update ambitious nationally determined \ncontributions, noting that article 4, paragraph 3, of the Agreement states that each \nparty\u2019s successive nationally determined contribution will represent a progression \nbeyond the party\u2019s then current nationally determined contribution and reflect its \nhighest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities \nand respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, \nencourages parties to formulate and communicate long-term strategies on the basis of \nthe best available scientific knowledge and with a view to achieving the purpose of \nthe Agreement and make financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low \ngreenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development, and stresses the \nimportance of mobilizing means of implementation from all sources, including \nadequate financial support, inter alia, for mitigation and adaptation, taking into \naccount the specific needs and special circumstances of developing countries, \nespecially

synergies between the implementation of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the Agreement;  \n \n4. \nRecalls that the Paris Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including its objective, \naims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of \nsustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by holding the \nincrease in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above \npre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees \nCelsius above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the \nrisks and impacts of climate change, increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse \nimpacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas \nemissions development in a manner that does not threaten food production, and making \nfinance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and \nclimate-resilient development;  \n \n5. \nReaffirms the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in \nthe global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial \nlevels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius \nabove pre-industrial levels, recognizes that the impacts of climate change will be much \nlower at the temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared with 2 degrees \nCelsius, and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees \nCelsius, also recognizes that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius requires \nrapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including \nreducing global carbon dioxide emissions, by 43 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2019 \nlevel, and to net zero by or around mid-century, and further recognizes that this requires \naccelerated action in this critical decade, on the basis of the best available scientific \nknowledge and equity, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities and \nrespective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances and in the context \nof sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, and, in accordance with \narticle 4 of the Paris Agreement, reiterates the aim to reach global peaking of \ngreenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer \nfor developing countries, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance \nwith best available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions \n\nA/RES/78/153 \nProtection of global climate for present and future generations \nof humankind\n \n23-25901\n8/13 \n \nby sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, \non the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to \neradicate poverty;  \n \n6. \nRecalls, in line with decisions 1/CMA.3 and 1/CMA.4, 28  the call to \naccelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies and the \nadoption of policies to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by \nrapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency \nmeasures, including accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal \npower and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, while providing targeted \nsupport to the poorest and most vulnerable, in line with national circumstances, and \nrecognizing the need for support towards a just transition;  \n \n7. \nLooks forward to the conclusion of the first global stocktake at the fifth \nsession of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the \nParis Agreement, at the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to assess the collective \nprogress towards achieving the purpose of the Paris Agreement and its long-term \ngoals,29 and recognizes the technical work conducted in 2022 and 2023;  \n \n8. \nWelcomes the nationally determined contributions submitted to date, and \nrecalls that the regular updating of such contributions will reflect the highest possible \nlevel of ambition, in the light of different national circumstances, and provide the \ninformation necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding, in accordance with \nthe relevant decisions;  \n \n9. \nNotes with concern that, according to the synthesis report on nationally \ndetermined contributions 30  published by the secretariat of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, the nationally determined contributions \npresented thus far by the parties to the Paris Agreement are not sufficient and that \naction is needed to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below \n2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the \ntemperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, urges parties \nthat have not yet communicated new or updated nationally determined contributions \nto do so as soon as possible, and encourages parties to communicate in 2025 \nnationally determined contributions with an end date of
