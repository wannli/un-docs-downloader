fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an important role \nin ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,  \n \nConcerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the \nTerritories as international financial centres to the detriment of the world

public awareness campaign aimed at assisting the \npeople of Guam with their inalienable right to self-determination and in gaining a better \nunderstanding of the options for self-determination, on a case-by-case basis,  \n \nMindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the Caribbean \nand Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of representatives \nof the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for the Special \nCommittee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the seminars, which \nalternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element in the context of a \nUnited Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of the Territories,  \n \nWelcoming the Pacific

Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies \nof the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,  \n \nNoting with concern that a plebiscite on self-determination has been brought to \na halt, which followed the ruling 6  of a federal court in the United States, the \nadministering Power, holding that the plebiscite could not be limited to native \ninhabitants,  \n \nRecalling, in this regard, the statement made by a representative of the Governor \nof Guam at the 2019 Caribbean regional seminar concerning the implications of the \njudicial case in the light of the nature and essence of the Charter of the United Nations \nand resolution 1514 (XV),7 \n \nCognizant of the efforts made by the Guam Commission on Decolonization for \nthe Implementation and

options, and recalling that more than \n11,000 native inhabitants had been registered in the Guam decolonization registry to \nvote in the plebiscite,  \n \nRecalling that, in a referendum held in 1987, the registered and eligible voters \nof Guam endorsed a draft Guam Commonwealth Act that would establish a new \nframework for relations between the Territory and the administering Power, providing \nfor a greater measure of internal self-government for Guam and recognition of the \nright of the CHamoru people of Guam to self-determination for the Territory,  \n \nAware that negotiations between the administering Power and the territorial \nGovernment on the draft Guam Commonwealth Act ended in 1997 and that Guam has \nsubsequently established a non\u2011binding plebiscite process for a self-determination \nvote by the eligible CHamoru voters,  \n \nCognizant of the importance of the administering Power\u2019s implementing its \nprogramme of transferring surplus federal land to the Government of Guam,  \n_______________ \n \n5 See resolution 75/123. \n \n6 District Court of Guam, Davis v.
