Also reaffirms the decision to create levels of discount to facilitate \nautomatic, predictable movement between categories on the basis of the per capita \ngross national income of Member States; \n \n11. \nDecides that, as from 1 January 2019, the rates of assessment for \npeacekeeping should be based on the 10 levels of contribution and parameters set \nforth in the table below: \n\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses \nof United Nations peacekeeping operations \nA/RES/73/272\n \n3/4\n18-22657 \n \n \nLevel Criterion \nThreshold in \nUnited States \ndollars  \n(2019\u20132021) \nDiscount \n(percentage) \nA \nPermanent members of the Security Council \nNot applicable \nPremium \nB \nAll Member States, except those covered below and \nlevel A \nNot applicable \n0 \nC \nAs listed in the annex to General Assembly resolution \n55/235  \nNot applicable \n7.5 \nD \nMember States with per capita gross national income \nless than 2 times the average for all Member States \n(except level A, C and J contributors) \nUnder 20,952 \n20 \nE \nMember States with per capita gross national income \nless than 1.8 times the average for all Member States \n(except level A, C and J contributors) \nUnder 18,857 \n40 \nF \nMember States with per capita gross national income \nless than 1.6 times the average for all Member States \n(except level A, C and J contributors) \nUnder 16,762 \n60 \nG \nMember States with per capita gross national income \nless than 1.4 times the average for all Member States \n(except level A, C and J contributors) \nUnder 14,666 \n70 \nH \nMember States with per capita gross national income \nless than 1.2 times the average for all Member States \n(except level A, C and J contributors) \nUnder 12,571 \n80 (or 70 on a \nvoluntary basis)a \nI \nMember States with per capita gross national income \nless than the average for all Member States (except \nlevel A, C and J contributors) \nUnder 10,476 \n80 \nJ \nLeast developed countries (except level A and C \ncontributors) \nNot applicable \n90 \n \n \na \nMember States in level H* have a discount of 70 per cent. \n \n \n \n12.
