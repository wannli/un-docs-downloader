aforementioned letter from the Secretary-General,7 the cessation of \nor restriction on the activities of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \nPalestine Refugees in the Near East would leave Palestine refugees without the \nessential assistance that they require, \n \nExpressing the view that these developments demand consideration by and \nguidance from the International Court of
