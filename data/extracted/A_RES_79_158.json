only with the free and full \nconsent of the intending spouses, and further stressing that this consent must be \ninformed, \n \nRecognizing that the eradication of poverty, the elimination of hunger, social \nprotection, access to quality early childhood, primary and secondary education, \nemployability skills, livelihood support and economic empowerment, in a safe \nenvironment, with a strong social work system, meaningful participation and \ninclusion in decision-making, universal access to affordable, quality and inclusive \nhealthcare services, nutrition, full access to clean water, including safe drinking \nwater, sanitation and hygiene, menstrual health and hygiene and affordable and \naccessible menstrual products, skills development and the combating of all forms of \ndiscrimination and violence, among other things, are all necessary for the \nempowerment of the girl child, contributing to preventing, addressing and eliminating \nchild, early and forced marriage and supporting already married, divorced, separated, \nor widowed girls and women, \n \nExpressing concern that despite the recent progress made globally towards \nending child, early and forced marriage, including a decrease to 19 per cent in the \nproportion of girls who were married before the age of 18 in the past decade, progress \nhas been uneven across regions, both between and within countries, and that existing \ndata show that, at the current pace of progress, target 5.3 of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, which involves ending the practice by 2030, will not be met in \nany region of the world, and recognizing that urgent local, national, regional and \ninternational action, including the allocation of adequate financing, is required to \naccelerate progress to eliminate child, early and forced marriage, \n \nRecognizing that chronic poverty remains one of the biggest obstacles to \nmeeting the needs and promoting and protecting the rights of the child, including the \ngirl child, and that girls living in poverty, including those living in rural and remote \nareas, are more likely to experience harmful practices, such as child, early and forced \nmarriage, and recognizing also that the eradication of poverty in all its forms and \ndimensions is critical to realizing the rights of girls and must remain a high priority \nfor the international community, \n \nNoting with concern the effects that humanitarian emergencies, armed conflict, \nnatural disasters, such as floods and droughts, and the persistent effects of the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic are having on the hard-won gains \nachieved on ending harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage, and \nwhich may further compromise the ability of Member States to achieve the \nSustainable Development Goals, including target 5.3, by 2030, \n \nNoting that the current pace of change is not sufficient to eliminate child, early \nand forced marriage by 2030, where, in addition to the 12 million child, early and \nforced marriages that occur every year, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are \nprojected to result in up to 10 million additional cases of child, early and forced \nmarriage that otherwise would have been averted between 2020 and 2030, and noting \nalso that even further increases may result from the impacts of natural disasters, the \nadverse impacts of climate change, humanitarian emergencies and armed conflicts, \nwith girls from poor households, rural and remote areas, those living in conflict-\naffected areas, humanitarian situations and those who have dropped out of formal \neducation particularly at risk, \n \nRecognizing that global health threats, climate change, biodiversity loss, \nenvironmental degradation, more frequent and intense natural disasters, armed \nconflicts, violent extremism as and when conducive to terrorism, and related \nhumanitarian emergencies and the forced displacement of people have particularly \nnegative impacts on women and girls, including those with disabilities, while \n\nA/RES/79/158 \nChild, early and forced marriage\n \n24-24151\n4/15 \n \nrecognizing also that poverty, including the feminization of poverty, insecurity, early \nand unintended pregnancy and lack of access to quality education are also among the \nroot causes of child, early and forced marriage, \n \nDeeply alarmed by reports of the abduction, trafficking and forced religious \nconversion of women and girls, including those belonging to religious minorities, by \narmed groups and other non-State actors in connection with child, early and forced \nmarriage, \n \nRecognizing that, in some regions and contexts, the practice of child, early and \nforced marriage may include other arrangements, including informal unions, that are \nnot formalized, registered or recognized by a religious, customary or State authority, \nand that such arrangements should be addressed and eliminated in policies and \nprogrammes to prevent, address and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and \nthat strengthening efforts to collect quality disaggregated data and information on \nthese arrangements will help to develop responses for affected girls and women, \n \nNoting with concern that deep-rooted gender discrimination, inequalities and \nstereotypes, harmful practices, perceptions and customs, patriarchal attitudes and \nstructures and discriminatory social norms that consider women and girls to be \ninferior to men and boys are not only obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights \nand the empowerment of all women and girls, but are also among the root causes of \nchild, early and forced marriage, and that the persistence of child, early and forced \nmarriage places children, in particular girls, at greater risk of being exposed to and \nencountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, \n \nNoting with concern also that child, early and forced marriage remains common \nin rural areas and among the poorest communities and has increased among the \npoorest communities over the past decade, and acknowledging the correlation \nbetween child, early and forced marriage and economic insecurity, poverty and lack \nof income opportunities and that the immediate alleviation and eradication of extreme \npoverty must remain a high priority for the international community, \n \nRecognizing that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and \nunderreported and often coincides with impunity and lack of accountability, \nparticularly at the community level, and that the persistence of child, early and forced \nmarriage places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering \nvarious forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including marital \nrape and sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status \nof girls and adolescent girls in society, \n \nRecognizing also that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to \nthe achievement of the economic empowerment of women and their social and \neconomic development, including through the disproportionate share of unpaid care \nand domestic work shouldered by girls and women, thereby hampering the ability of \nwomen to enter, advance and remain in the labour market, and that this harmful \npractice can impede economic independence and impose direct and indirect short- \nand long-term costs on society, and recognizing further that the economic autonomy \nof women can expand their options for leaving abusive and violent relationships, \n \nRecognizing further that child, early and forced marriage undermines women\u2019s \nand girls\u2019 autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives and that the \nempowerment of and investment in all women and girls, as well as the strengthening \nof their voice, agency, leadership and full and meaningful participation in all \ndecisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality \nand multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, violence and poverty and are \ncritical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and \ninclusive economic growth, \n\nChild, early and forced marriage \nA/RES/79/158\n \n5/15\n24-24151 \n \n \nBearing in mind the crucial importance of civil registration and vital statistics, \nincluding births, deaths and marriages, for the realization of the human rights of \nindividuals, especially girls, recalling that the provision of legal identity for all, \nincluding birth registration, is included as target 16.9 in the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development, and recognizing that full implementation of this target is \ncritical in accelerating progress to prevent, address and eliminate child, early and \nforced marriage, and will have an impact on the achievement of other targets and \ngoals, \n \nRecognizing that men and boys can be affected by child, early and forced \nmarriage and also benefit from gender equality and the empowerment of all women \nand girls, and should play a role as strategic partners and allies of women and girls, \nincluding by supporting women and girls at risk, and that the meaningful engagement \nof men and boys can contribute to eliminating discriminatory social norms that \nperpetuate sexual and gender-based violence, as well as harmful practices, such as \nchild, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality \nand the empowerment of all women and girls and the full and equal enjoyment of all \ntheir human rights, \n \nRecognizing also that families, communities and religious, traditional and \ncommunity leaders have an essential role to play in eliminating negative social norms \nand harmful traditional or customary practices and confronting gender inequality, and \nrecognizing further that empowering girls, including already married girls, requires \ntheir active and meaningful participation in decision-making processes in all matters \naffecting them and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including \nthrough women\u2019s organizations and girls-led organizations, with the active support \nand engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys \nand men, as well as the wider community, \n \nRecognizing further the need to support girls and women who have been \nsubjected to child, early and forced marriage, as well as their children, and \nunderscoring the importance of removing structural barriers and discrimination that \nprevent their access to services, including education, social protection and healthcare \nservices, including sexual and reproductive healthcare services, that respond to their \nspecific needs, \n \nExpressing deep concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally \naffects girls who have had minimal, disrupted or no access to formal and informal \neducation and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities and the \ndevelopment of employable and life skills for girls and young women, in particular \ngirls who are forced to drop out of school owing to pregnancy, marriage, childbirth \nand/or childcare and other unpaid care and domestic work responsibilities, as well as \nstigma relating to menstruation, gender stereotypes and negative social norms that \nconfine married women and girls to the home, and that educational possibilities and \nopportunities are directly related to the achievement of gender equality and the \nempowerment of all women and girls and the full enjoyment of all their human rights, \nwomen\u2019s employment and economic opportunities and their full, effective, equal and \nmeaningful participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance \nand decision-making, \n \nAcknowledging that girls, particularly adolescent girls, including those who are \namong the poorest, those impacted by armed conflict and by disasters, including \ninternally displaced persons and refugees, those living in rural and remote areas and \nthose in vulnerable situations, are at particular risk of dropping out and not returning \nto school, thereby increasing their vulnerability to poverty, child, early and forced \nmarriage, early pregnancy, female genital mutilation and all forms of violence, \nincluding sexual violence, \n\nA/RES/79/158 \nChild, early and forced marriage\n \n24-24151\n6/15 \n \n \nNoting with concern that, owing to school closures, the COVID-19 pandemic \nhas exposed the digital divides, within and between developed and developing \ncountries, including the gender digital divide, and vast disparities in the availability \nof learning materials, including access to the Internet and communication devices, \nparticularly in rural and remote areas, while recognizing that, with the increased \nreliance on virtual learning, many schools, especially in developing countries, lack \nadequate technology and equipment to provide online teaching, which leads to limited \naccess or lack of access to quality education for many children, particularly girls in \nvulnerable situations, such as those from poorer families and those living in rural and \nremote areas, who are far less likely to be able to benefit from online education, skills \ndevelopment, online services and future job opportunities, and that the gender digital \ndivide and the lack of access, ownership and use of digital technologies of women \nand girls also limits their development of digital skills and, in turn, their ability to \naccess information, including on their rights, reinforcing gender inequality and \nfurther increasing their vulnerability to child, early and forced marriage, \n \nRecognizing that girls, particularly adolescent girls, are often at greater risk of \nbeing exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, \nparticularly in digital contexts, including exploitation, abuse and cyberbullying, \nincreasing their vulnerability to child, early and forced marriage, and reaffirming the \nimportance of access to technologies, digital literacy and skills among girls, as well \ntheir parents or legal guardians, caregivers, teachers and educators, and including \ninternally displaced children, refugees, migrants, those living in humanitarian \nsituations, as well as those with disabilities and those living in rural and remote areas \nand from the poorest households, especially in developing countries, \n \nNoting with concern that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls \nare still more likely than boys to remain excluded from education, particularly at the \ntransition from primary to secondary education, and recognizing that the attendance \nof girls at school can be affected by the expectation for girls to undertake a \ndisproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and can further be affected \nby negative perceptions of menstruation and a lack of means to maintain safe personal \nhygiene, such as secure, adequate and accessible water, sanitation and hygiene \nfacilities in schools that meet the needs of girls, as well as violence and harassment \non the way to and from and at school, \n \nRecognizing that child, early and forced marriage increases vulnerability to all \nforms of violence and remains a serious threat to the right to the enjoyment of the \nhighest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to multiple aspects of \nthe physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited \nto their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, \nfrequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, \nobstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and AIDS, and \nnoting that adolescent mothers and their children face higher risks of maternal, \nprenatal and neonatal complications and other life-threatening conditions, including \nchild and maternal mortality, \n \nRecognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage \nare highly exacerbated during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced \ndisplacement, armed conflict, public health emergencies and natural disasters because \nof various factors, including insecurity, increased risks of sexual and gender-based \nviolence, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, gender \ninequality, lack of access to continuous, inclusive and equitable quality early \nchildhood, primary and secondary education, the stigmatization of pregnancy outside \nmarriage, the absence of family planning services, disruption in social networks and \nroutines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, and that this \nrequires increased attention, appropriate protection measures and coordinated action \n\nChild, early and forced marriage \nA/RES/79/158\n \n7/15\n24-24151 \n \nby relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and \ngirls affected, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing \nfurther the importance of addressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls \nto sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation in those situations, \n \nRecognizing further that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage \nand supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require \nappropriate gender-responsive and age-sensitive protection, prevention and response \nmeasures, as well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, and that existing \ngaps in the collection and use of reliable data and evidence remain a major challenge \nfor programming and informing appropriate measures and actions, \n \nRecognizing that research initiatives and disaggregated data collection at the \nglobal, regional, national and subnational levels provide critical information on child, \nearly and forced marriage and how trends related to child, early and forced marriage \nchange over time and that further data and research is needed in contexts with a high \nprevalence of child, early and forced marriage, \n \n1. \nTakes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General;15 \n \n2. \nReaffirms the commitment at the very heart of the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development to leave no one behind and commit to taking more tangible \nsteps to support people in vulnerable situations and to reach the furthest behind first, \nand emphasizes the commitment to get back onto a track of accelerated progress \ntowards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, including target 5.3, noting \nthat gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and their full and \nequal enjoyment of their human rights will make a crucial contribution to progress \nacross all the Goals and targets, while reiterating that States will not be able to achieve \nthe ambitious Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda without a revitalized and \nenhanced Global Partnership and comparably ambitious means of implementation and \nthe mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the implementation of the Agenda; \n \n3. \nCalls upon States, with the participation of relevant stakeholders, \nincluding women and girls, men and boys, parents and other family members, \nteachers, religious, traditional and community leaders, civil society, organizations led \nby girls, women\u2019s organizations, youth and human rights groups, the media and the \nprivate sector, to develop and implement holistic, comprehensive and coordinated \nage- and gender-responsive and disability-inclusive, victim-centred and multisectoral \nresponses and strategies that respect human rights to prevent, address and eliminate \nchild, early and forced marriage, to support girls and women who are affected or at \nrisk, who have fled such a marriage or whose marriage has dissolved, and widowed \ngirls or women who were married as girls, including through the strengthening of \nchild protection systems, social work programmes, protection mechanisms such as \nsafe shelters, mental health and psychosocial support services, empowerment and \nlivelihood support, community sensitization, family reunification, access to justice \nand the sharing of best practices across borders; \n \n4. \nAlso calls upon States to develop and implement measures at all levels to \nend child, early and forced marriage, including national and subnational action plans \nwhere appropriate, and to make adequate resources, including financing, available \nacross relevant sectors, including health, nutrition, sanitation, shelter, protection, \ngovernance and education; \n \n5. \nUrges States to enact, enforce and uphold laws and policies aimed at \npreventing, addressing and ending child, early and forced marriage, including by \nenabling women and girls to leave the marriage without undue financial or \n__________________ \n \n15 A/79/308. \n\nA/RES/79/158 \nChild, early and forced marriage\n \n24-24151\n8/15 \n \nadministrative burden, protecting those at risk and addressing the needs of those \naffected, and work towards the coherence of these laws and policies at the local level, \nto ensure that marriage is entered into only with the informed, free and full consent \nof the intending spouses, and further urges States to recognize child, early and forced \nmarriage as a violation or abuse of human rights; \n \n6. \nCalls upon States to enact, enforce and uphold laws concerning a \nminimum age of marriage, to monitor their application and to progressively amend \nlaws with lower minimum ages of marriage and/or ages of majority to 18 and engage \nall relevant authorities to ensure that these laws are well known and fully \nimplemented; \n \n7. \nUrges States to repeal or amend laws and remove any provisions that \nenable perpetrators of rape, sexual exploitation and abuse or abduction to escape \nprosecution and punishment by marrying their victims and that may enable, justify, \nor lead to child, early and forced marriage, and to engage traditional and religious \nleaders, among others, to eliminate traditional practices that resolve sexual violence \nincidents through marriage; \n \n8. \nCalls upon States to strengthen their efforts to ensure the timely \nregistration of births and marriages, especially for individuals living in rural and \nremote areas, including by identifying and removing all physical, administrative, \nprocedural and any other barriers that impede access to registration and by providing, \nwhere lacking, mechanisms for the registration of customary and religious marriages, \nas well as working to ensure that the registration of births and marriages remains \naccessible in emergencies or is re-established as quickly as possible when affected; \n \n9. \nAlso calls upon States to promote the full and meaningful participation of \nand active consultation with children and adolescents, including those who are hardest \nto reach and already married girls, girls who are divorced, separated or widowed in \nthe context of child, early and forced marriage, and girls who are pregnant or mothers, \non all issues affecting them, and to raise awareness about their rights, including the \nnegative impact of child, early and forced marriage, through safe spaces, forums and \nsupport networks, including in digital spaces, that provide accessible information, life \nskills, inclusive and equitable quality education, and leadership skills training and \nopportunities, including catch-up and literacy education, and lifelong learning \nopportunities, remote learning opportunities and childcare, as needed, to be \nempowered, to express themselves, to participate meaningfully in all decisions that \naffect them and to become agents of change within their communities; \n \n10. Further calls upon States to promote awareness-raising about the harmful \neffects of child, early and forced marriage on the individual and wider society and the \nbenefits of ending this harmful practice, including through open dialogue with all \nstakeholders, including girls and boys, women and men, religious, traditional and \ncommunity leaders, parents, legal guardians and other family members, to work with \nlocal communities to combat negative social norms and gender stereotypes that \ncondone child, early and forced marriage, to empower parents and communities to \nabandon the practice and to empower all women and girls to make informed decisions \nabout their lives; \n \n11. \nRecognizes that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his \nor her personality, should grow up in a family environment and in an atmosphere of \nhappiness, love and understanding and that parents or, as the case may be, legal \nguardians have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the \nchild, acknowledging the need to support their capacity to prevent and eliminate child, \nearly and forced marriage, and reaffirming that the best interests of the child will be \ntheir basic concern; \n\nChild, early and forced marriage \nA/RES/79/158\n \n9/15\n24-24151 \n \n \n12. Urges Governments, while addressing child, early and forced marriage, to \nconfront family poverty and social exclusion through investing in family-friendly and \nfamily-oriented policies addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty and \naimed at achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, \nincluding by extending coverage of social protection, inter alia, through nationally \nappropriate social protection systems and measures for all girls, focusing on early \nchildhood, primary and secondary education and training for future employment, and \non health, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion, paying special attention to \nage- and gender-responsive social protection measures, child allowances for parents \nand guidance to build their positive parenting knowledge and skills, pension benefits \nfor older persons, and protecting, supporting and empowering children, including \ngirls, in child-headed households; \n \n13. Also urges Governments, with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders, \nto tackle poverty, including the feminization of poverty, the lack of economic \nopportunities for women throughout their life course and other entrenched economic \nincentives that act as drivers of child, early and forced marriage, including by \nensuring the rights of all women and girls to inheritance and property, without \ndiscrimination of any kind, including in relation to marital status, their equal access \nwith men and boys to social protection, childcare services and direct financial \nservices, to support the right of girls to receive and continue their education, including \nthrough their continued enrolment in school during pregnancy and re-enrolment in \nschool after childbirth, to develop livelihood opportunities through access to inclusive \nand equitable quality education, including technical and vocational education, and \ntraining and life skills education, including entrepreneurship and financial and digital \nliteracy, and to promote freedom of movement, women\u2019s equal access to full and \nproductive employment and decent work, including waged and salaried work, as well \nas equal political participation and rights to inherit and own land; \n \n14.
