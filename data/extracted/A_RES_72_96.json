\nAcknowledging the outcome of the referendum held on 4 November 2014, in \nwhich the proposal to give the Fono, the Territory\u2019s legislature, the authority to \noverride the Governor\u2019s veto

the \nCaribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of \nrepresentatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for \nthe Special Committee

\nSamoa at the 2017 Caribbean regional seminar,7 \n \nNoting also the statement made by a representative of the Governor of American \nSamoa at the 2017 Caribbean regional seminar that some constitutional rights of the \nadministering Power were not extended to American Samoa and that elected leaders \nof the Territory had opposed the granting of birthright citizenship to the people of \nAmerican Samoa on the basis that a constitutional interpretation which would allow \noutsiders an equal right to own land might undermine and eventually destroy Samoan \nculture,  \n \nNoting further the statement made by a representative of the Governor of \nAmerican Samoa at the 2017 Caribbean regional seminar that, without a flexible and \ninnovative approach, prospects for decolonization in American Samoa were limited,  \n \nAware of the work of the Future Political Status Study Commission, completed \nin 2006, the release of its report, with recommendations, in January
