 \n \n2. \nAcknowledge that Millennium Development Goal 6 and associated \nstrategies, plans and programmes for the prevention and care of tuberculosis helped \nto reverse the trend of the tuberculosis epidemic;  \n \n3. \nReaffirm the political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General \nAssembly on antimicrobial resistance, 5 the political declaration of the high-level \nmeeting of the General Assembly on HIV and AIDS,6 the political declaration of the \nthird high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of \nnon-communicable diseases,7 and the political declaration of the high-level meeting \non universal health coverage;8 \n \n4. \nRecall the first World Health Organization Global Ministerial Conference \non Ending Tuberculosis in the Sustainable Development Era: A Multisectoral \nResponse, held in Moscow on 16 and 17 November 2017, and its Moscow Declaration \nto End TB;  \n \n5. \nReaffirm the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International \nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the right of everyone to the \nenjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that \nthe fulfilment of the right to health in the context of tuberculosis is closely linked to \nthe right to enjoy and share the benefits of scientific progress and its applications, and \nnote with concern that access to tuberculosis services and to the benefits of research \nand innovation such as quality, safe, efficacious and affordable tuberculosis \ndiagnostics and treatment, remains challenging, especially for developing countries;  \n \n6. \nReaffirm further that health is a precondition for, and an outcome and \nindicator of the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable \ndevelopment and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment and that sustainable development can be achieved only in the absence \nof a high prevalence of debilitating diseases such as tuberculosis, which requires \nfurther multifaceted efforts, including to support developing countries, especially \n__________________ \n \n2  See World Health Organization, document WHA67/2014/REC/1, resolution 67.1. \n \n3  Resolution 70/1. \n \n4  Resolution 69/313, annex. \n \n5  Resolution 71/3. \n \n6  Resolution 75/284. \n \n7  Resolution 73/2 \n \n8  Resolution 74/2. \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on the fight against \ntuberculosis \nA/RES/78/5\n \n3/15\n23-20108 \n \nthose with a high burden of tuberculosis to ensure they are on track to achieve the \nSustainable Development Goals, especially in light of the continuing impacts of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic;  \n \n7. \nRemain deeply concerned that while it has been 30 years since the World \nHealth Organization declared tuberculosis a global emergency, the global tuberculosis \nepidemic still is a critical challenge in all regions and affects every country of the \nworld and disproportionately affects developing countries, and that although \ntuberculosis is preventable and curable, an estimated 10.6 million people fell ill with \ntuberculosis, of whom 56.5 per cent were men, 32.5 per cent women and 11 per cent \nchildren, and approximately 1.6 million people died from the disease in 2021, \nincluding approximately 187,000 people with HIV, making tuberculosis one of the \nleading causes of death worldwide, that 30 high-tuberculosis-burden countries \naccounted for 87 per cent of those affected, and that one quarter of the world\u2019s \npopulation is estimated to have been infected with the bacterium that causes the \ndisease and that millions of people ill with tuberculosis are missing out on quality \ncare each year, including on access to affordable diagnostic tests and treatment, \nespecially in developing countries;  \n \n8. \nRecognize that tuberculosis affects populations inequitably and \ncontributes to the cycle of ill health and poverty, that malnutrition and inadequate \nliving conditions contribute to the spread of tuberculosis and its impact upon the \ncommunity, and that tuberculosis is fundamentally linked to a majority of the leading \ndevelopment challenges addressed by the 2030 Agenda;  \n \n9. \nRecognize that tuberculosis disproportionately affects people in \nvulnerable situations in all countries, that the epidemic is driven by both health and \nsocial and economic determinants, such as poverty, undernutrition, HIV, housing \nconditions, mental health, diabetes, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol and other \nsubstance abuse, including drug injection, incarceration, history of incarceration and \nother congregated settings, as well as occupational risks, such as among miners and \nhealth-care workers, that people with tuberculosis and their families face financial \nhardships before, during and after seeking care, and that these determinants and \nsocioeconomic consequences of tuberculosis are exacerbated by or arise through \nhealth and humanitarian emergencies, armed conflicts, displacement, climate change \nand disasters, and therefore affirm that the response to tuberculosis needs to be \npeople-centred, community-based, gender-responsive, with full respect for human \nrights, and integrated across relevant health and other sectors;  \n \n10. Recognize that structural inequity, stigma, racism and discrimination, \nincluding against women, inadequate investment in, and inequitable access to \ntuberculosis prevention, diagnosis, treatment remain key roadblocks to ending the \ntuberculosis epidemic, that people with tuberculosis may suffer from stigma and all \nforms of discrimination and that barriers to the enjoyment of human rights need to be \naddressed through comprehensive political, legal and programmatic actions;  \n \n11. \nNote the multidirectional relationship between tuberculosis, mental health \nconditions, social and economic determinants, including stigma and discrimination, \nthat can lead to greater morbidity and poorer treatment outcomes, that the prevalence \nof depression is as high as 45 per cent among individuals with tuberculosis, and that \nthis needs to be addressed through integrated programming;  \n \n12. Recognize the profound socioeconomic challenges and financial hardships \nfaced by people affected by tuberculosis, including in obtaining an early diagnosis, \nin being subject to extremely long treatment regimens, with drugs that could involve \nsevere side effects, as well as in securing integrated support, including from the \ncommunity, and therefore affirm that all these people require integrated, people-\ncentred prevention, diagnosis, treatment, management of side effects, and care, as \n\nA/RES/78/5 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on the fight against \ntuberculosis\n \n23-20108\n4/15 \n \nwell as psychosocial, nutritional and socioeconomic support for successful treatment, \nincluding to reduce stigma and discrimination;  \n \n13. Acknowledge that strong and resilient public health systems are an \nessential pillar of the tuberculosis response, including health workforce capacity-\nbuilding for public and private sector care, and recognizes that women health workers \nmake up 70 per cent of the global health workforce and 90 per cent of the front-line \nhealth workforce, but hold only 25 per cent of senior leadership positions in health, \nand resolve to address the 24 per cent pay gap compared to men across the health \nsector, and to provide better opportunities and working environments for women to \nensure their role and leadership in the health sector;  \n \n14. Also acknowledge that investments in building robust, integrated and \nresilient health systems, including in tuberculosis prevention, detection and treatment \nservices and research and development infrastructure and community responses can \nadvance universal health coverage and contribute to effective pandemic prevention, \npreparedness and response, and recognizing the opportunity for further coordination \nfor global health policies that the 2023 health-related General Assembly high-level \nmeetings present;  \n \n15. Recognize that tuberculosis can cause infertility, maternal and perinatal \nmortality, that tuberculosis treatment can reduce obstetric complications, and that \naddressing this requires universal access to integrated tuberculosis care for women \nand girls across the life course, in order to obtain the highest standard of health, and \nthat these must not be interrupted in times of emergency;  \n \n16. Reaffirm the importance of collaboration and cooperation at the global and \nregional level, in particular across the health, finance, trade and development sectors, \nin order to enhance collective actions to end tuberculosis; \n \n17. Commend the progress achieved in saving 74 million lives across all \ncountries between 2000 and 2021 through provision of tuberculosis treatment for \npeople with tuberculosis and antiretroviral therapy for people with HIV co-infected \nwith tuberculosis, and regret that only some progress has been achieved towards \ntargets and commitments agreed in the political declaration of the 2018 high-level \nmeeting of the General Assembly on the fight against tuberculosis;  \n \n18. Note with concern that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a \ndamaging impact on access to tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care \nand the burden of tuberculosis disease and that progress made in the years up to 2019 \nhas slowed, stalled or reversed, and global tuberculosis targets are off track, and that \nthe number of people diagnosed with tuberculosis and notified to public health \nreporting systems fell by 18 per cent from 7.1 million in 2019 to 5.8 million in 2020, \nfollowed by a partial recovery to 6.4 million in 2021, and that as a result of these \ndisruptions, the number of people who died from tuberculosis increased in 2020 and \n2021 compared to prior years, and the number of people who fell ill from tuberculosis \nincreased in 2021;  \n \n19. Express deep concern that in 2021 only 61 per cent of people with \ntuberculosis, including 38 per cent of children, were diagnosed and treated for \ntuberculosis, that only 38 per cent of people with tuberculosis were diagnosed with \nWorld Health Organization-recommended rapid molecular diagnostics, and, as a \nresult, between 2018 and 2021:  \n \n(a) \nOnly 26.3 million people, including 1.9 million children and 649,000 \npeople with drug-resistant tuberculosis, were reported to have been provided with \ntuberculosis treatment, which translates to 66 per cent of the 40 million target;  \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on the fight against \ntuberculosis \nA/RES/78/5\n \n5/15\n23-20108 \n \n \n(b) \nAnd only 12.5 million people, including 10.3 million people living with \nHIV, 1.6 million children under the age of 5 who are household contacts of people \naffected by tuberculosis and 0.6 million other household contacts of people affected \nby tuberculosis, were provided with tuberculosis preventive treatment, which \ntranslates to 42 per cent of the 30 million target agreed in the 2018 political \ndeclaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the fight against \ntuberculosis; \n \n(c) \nAnd that close to half of the people diagnosed with tuberculosis and their \nfamilies experienced financial hardship because of tuberculosis;  \n \n20. Welcome the commitment and support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria, through the seventh replenishment held in September 2022, \nwhich will help to sustain support for tuberculosis programmes;  \n \n21. Recognize the need to mobilize sufficient and sustainable financing for \nuniversal access to quality prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of tuberculosis, \nfrom all sources, with the aim of increasing overall global investments for ending \ntuberculosis, and to align with overall national health financing strategies, including \nin developing countries, to raise domestic revenues and provide international \nfinancial support, including at bilateral, regional and global levels, towards achieving \nuniversal health coverage and social protection strategies, in the lead-up to 2030;  \n \n22. Welcome progress in reaching 10.3 million people living with HIV with \ntuberculosis preventive treatment between 2018 and 2021, surpassing the target of \nreaching 6 million people between 2018 and 2022 set at the 2018 high-level meeting \nof the General Assembly on the fight against tuberculosis, with a total of 16 million \nreceiving tuberculosis preventive treatment since 2005 when the policy was \nintroduced, which translates to 42 per cent of people living with HIV having benefited \nfrom tuberculosis preventive treatment by 2021, although this remains far from \nreaching the 90 per cent target by 2025, agreed in the political declaration of the high-\nlevel meeting of the General Assembly on HIV and AIDS;  \n \n23. Note with concern that, although people living with HIV are about 16 \ntimes more likely to fall ill from tuberculosis compared to people without HIV and \nthat tuberculosis remains the leading cause of severe illness and death of people living \nwith HIV, almost half of people with HIV-associated tuberculosis are not diagnosed \nand treated for tuberculosis, and also note that in 2021, testing for HIV among people \nwith tuberculosis increased to 76 per cent compared to 64 per cent in 2018 and that \n89 per cent of people living with HIV who were diagnosed with tuberculosis were on \nantiretroviral treatment in 2021;  \n \n24. Acknowledge that ending tuberculosis requires accelerating progress \ntowards universal health coverage, particularly through strong and sustainable \nprimary health care, with multisectoral approaches that address tuberculosis \ndeterminants, that engages people affected by tuberculosis and civil society, and \nreaches people with tuberculosis, or at risk of tuberculosis, with equitable and \naffordable access to high-quality services, close to their everyday environments, \nenabling them to fully enjoy the benefits of scientific advances, and free of financial \nhardship;  \n \n25. Acknowledge that drug-resistant tuberculosis is a key component of the \nglobal challenge of antimicrobial resistance, and express grave concern that the scope \nand scale of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis illness \nand mortality place an additional burden on health and community systems, especially \nin low- and middle-income countries, and thereby pose a critical challenge that could \nreverse the progress made against the disease, against antimicrobial resistance and \ntowards the Sustainable Development Goals, and that there is a profound gap in \n\nA/RES/78/5 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on the fight against \ntuberculosis\n \n23-20108\n6/15 \n \naccess to quality diagnosis, treatment and care for those affected, and there is still a \nlow treatment success rate for those who are treated, and therefore acknowledge that \nit is necessary to ensure global collaboration, sustainable and sufficient political \nbuy-in and financial investment from all sources, strong and resilient health systems, \nand additional investment in research, development and innovation, recognizing that \ninnovation has the potential to benefit society at large;  \n \n26. Express concern that close to half a million people annually develop \ntuberculosis that is resistant to at least rifampicin, the most effective first-line drug, \nof whom only one in three accessed treatment in 2021 and of these, 40 per cent had \npoor health outcomes for reasons including gaps in access to World Health \nOrganization-recommended diagnostic tests and treatment, inefficient service \ndelivery models, medication side-effects, lack of access to treatment support, \ncomprehensive social protection and care and acknowledged lack of attention and \ncare to the needs of tuberculosis survivors for post-treatment follow-up, particularly \ndrug-resistant tuberculosis survivors;  \n \n27. Remain deeply concerned that financing for tuberculosis prevention, \ndiagnosis, treatment and care is inadequate, that overall total annual funding was \nconsistently less than half of the 13 billion United States dollars a year target set at \nthe 2018 high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the fight against \ntuberculosis, that domestic funding declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, while \nacknowledging that investment in care and the prevention of tuberculosis brings some \nof the largest gains in terms of lives saved and economic benefits from development \ninvestments;  \n \n28. Stress the importance of domestic and international funding for the \ntuberculosis response, particularly in high-burden countries, and note that overall \ninternational funding has stagnated since 2018, and stressing therefore the importance \nof adequately replenishing voluntary international financing mechanisms such as the \nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Unitaid, other sources of \nfinancing, including official development assistance, as well as innovative financing \nto support comprehensive national tuberculosis strategies as an integral part of costed \nnational health strategies, multilateral efforts and other initiatives, to end \ntuberculosis;  \n \n29. Reaffirm the central role of the World Health Organization as the leading \nagency on health in providing technical advice, guidance, direction and support on \ntuberculosis prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care, and urgently support its Global \nTuberculosis Programme, to end tuberculosis worldwide;  \n \n30. Commend progress achieved so far in tuberculosis research and innovation \nof new tests, drugs and regimens that informed World Health Organization guidance,9 \nincluding on the use of shorter-duration tuberculosis preventive treatment with less \npill burden, shorter-duration regimens for the treatment of drug-susceptible \ntuberculosis for adults and children, and more effective all-oral shorter-duration \nregimens for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis, including formulations \nappropriate for children, and note that although 26 high-tuberculosis-burden countries \nare using World Health Organization-recommended rapid molecular diagnostic tests \nand 126 countries have introduced all-oral regimens to treat drug-resistant forms of \ntuberculosis, supply and access to some drugs central to these regimens is not yet \nuniversally available;  \n \n31. Recognize that reaching the 2030 global tuberculosis targets requires, inter \nalia, technological breakthroughs by 2025, so that the annual decline in global \n__________________ \n \n9  See World Health Organization guidance, available at https://tbksp.org/en/guidance-books-solr. \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on the fight against \ntuberculosis \nA/RES/78/5\n \n7/15\n23-20108 \n \ntuberculosis incidence can be accelerated to an average of 17 per cent per year, and \nresearch and development is critical to achieving that goal;  \n \n32. Recall with concern that no new vaccines for prevention of all forms of \ntuberculosis have been licensed for over 100 years, that safe, effective, affordable, \naccessible and preventive vaccines for people of all ages which can be administered \nbefore or after exposure are essential to accelerate the decline in illness and mortality \nand reduce antimicrobial resistance, and acknowledge the importance of global \ncollaboration and increased investment to fast-track progress and ensure equitable \naccess and maximal return on public investment in scientific progress; \n \n33. Recall with concern that the utilization of World Health Organization-\nrecommended rapid molecular diagnostics remains far too limited, and that in 2021, \nonly 38 per cent of the 6.4 million people newly diagnosed with tuberculosis were \ninitially tested with World Health Organization-recommended rapid molecular \ndiagnostics, and acknowledging that the limited utilization of these rapid tests \nunderscores the urgent need for enhanced global collaboration to facilitate their wider \nuse to ensure more timely and accurate tuberculosis diagnoses, while further research \non point-of-care tests is urgently required;  \n \n34. Express concern that financing for tuberculosis research and innovation is \nonly half of the 2 billion United States dollars a year target agreed in the 2018 political \ndeclaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the fight against \ntuberculosis, and underscore that enhanced, sustained and equitable financing is \nrequired for the development and evaluation of better tools and strategies to ensure \ntuberculosis prevention and care for all, including to address social and economic \ndeterminants of the disease, as called for in the global strategy for tuberculosis \nresearch and innovation, 10  taking into account that an additional investment in \nresearch, development and innovation has the potential to benefit society at large;  \n \n35. Recognize the importance of national systems that monitor the availability, \naccessibility, acceptability, affordability and quality of tuberculosis care at their \nrespective national level;  \n \n36. Welcome the roll-out of the World Health Organization multisectoral \naccountability framework for tuberculosis as requested in General Assembly \nresolution 73/3 and World Health Assembly resolution 71.3, and emphasize the \ncontinued importance of multisectoral action and accountability, as appropriate, \nacross the health and nutrition, finance, labour, social protection, education, science \nand technology, justice, agriculture, the environment, including air quality, housing, \ntrade, development and other sectors, in order to ensure that all relevant stakeholders \npursue actions to end tuberculosis and leave no one behind through whole-of-society \nand whole-of-government approaches; \n \n37. Recognize that equitable, affordable and sustainable access to high-quality \ntuberculosis diagnostics, vaccines and medicines, including for preventive treatment, \nare essential to end illness, suffering and prevent further loss of life from tuberculosis, \nand further recognize the role played by relevant international organizations and \ninitiatives, such as the Stop TB Partnership/Global Drug Facility, working to improve \naccess to high-quality and affordable medicines, including appropriate formulations \nof medicines for children, and diagnostics to test, prevent and treat tuberculosis for \npopulations in need;  \n \n38. Recognize that active and meaningful engagement of civil society, people \nand communities affected by tuberculosis, and health-care workers, is vital to improve \naccess to tuberculosis prevention and care, relevant health information and education, \n__________________ \n \n10  See World Health Organization, document WHA73/2020/REC/1, resolution 73.3. \n\nA/RES/78/5 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on the fight against \ntuberculosis\n \n23-20108\n8/15 \n \nand contribute to the promotion and protection of the human rights of people affected \nby tuberculosis, including through planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation \nand accountability, as appropriate and at all levels, of the tuberculosis response and \nin research, development and delivery of tuberculosis services;  \n \n39. Commit to protect and promote the right to the enjoyment of the highest \nattainable standard of physical and mental health, and the right to enjoy the benefits \nof scientific progress and its application in order to advance towards universal access \nto quality, affordable, inclusive, equitable and timely prevention, diagnosis, \ntreatment, care and awareness-raising related to tuberculosis, and address its \neconomic and social determinants;  \n \n40. Improve availability, affordability and efficiency of health products by \nincreasing transparency of prices of medicines, vaccines, medical devices, \ndiagnostics, assistive products, cell- and gene-based therapies and other health \ntechnologies across the value chain, including through improved regulations and \nbuilding constructive engagement and a stronger partnership with relevant \nstakeholders, including industries, the private sector and civil society, in accordance \nwith national and regional legal frameworks and contexts, to address the global \nconcern about the high prices of some health products and in this regard encourage \nthe World Health Organization to continue its efforts to biennially convene the Fair \nPricing Forum with Member States and all relevant stakeholders to discuss the \naffordability and transparency of prices and costs relating to health products; \n \n41. Recognize the need to strengthen linkages between ending tuberculosis \nand the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including towards achieving \nuniversal health coverage, through the Sustainable Development Goals review \nprocesses, including the high-level political forum on sustainable development, and \nnoting relevant resolutions and decisions made by the World Health Assembly;  \n \n42. Commit to urgently strengthen measures to reduce tuberculosis-related \ndeaths, including among people living with HIV, through comprehensive \nmultisectoral actions, including but not limited to the implementation of the World \nHealth Organization End TB Strategy, that address all determinants and risk factors \nof tuberculosis and improve health outcomes, and close the large gaps in access to \ntuberculosis prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care, especially in high-burden \ncountries;  \n \n43. Continue to support the World Health Organization multisectoral \naccountability framework for tuberculosis by establishing or strengthening high-level \nmultisectoral accountability and review mechanisms, in line with national contexts, \ndefining the roles and responsibilities of relevant sectors and stakeholders with the \nmeaningful engagement of people and communities affected by tuberculosis, and to \nstrengthen national review of progress aligned to agreed national and global \ntuberculosis targets, including the commitments in the present political declaration, \nwith support from the World Health Organization to enhance efforts in ending \ntuberculosis;  \n \n44. Commit to develop and implement ambitious costed national tuberculosis \nstrategic plans or national health strategies with multisectoral approaches, including \nwith the active involvement of communities and people affected by tuberculosis, civil \nsociety, private sector and other stakeholders to enable universal access to quality \ntuberculosis services and actions to address all tuberculosis determinants and drivers, \nsuch as poverty, undernutrition, HIV, inequalities by social and economic position, as \nwell as inadequate housing and living conditions, barriers to gender equality, and \nnon-communicable diseases, including diabetes;  \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on the fight against \ntuberculosis \nA/RES/78/5\n \n9/15\n23-20108 \n \n \n45. Emphasize that efforts to increase awareness on tuberculosis must be \nintensified, including through continuous sensitization, teaching and training of \nhealth workers to consider tuberculosis in differential diagnosis, bearing in mind the \nneed to invest in a better public health infrastructure and workforce to improve \nprevention efforts;  \n \n46. Strengthen support and capacity-building in low-income and lower-\nmiddle-income countries, many of which have high rates of tuberculosis combined \nwith health and social protection systems that have limited resources, including to \nsupport implementing multisectoral approaches in their response to the tuberculosis \nepidemic;  \n \n47. Further commit to strengthen notification of all people diagnosed with \ntuberculosis, by public, private and community-based health-care providers to \nnational health information systems, facilitated by the expanded use of secure, \nconfidential and digital case-based surveillance, with full respect for human rights, in \nline with the highest applicable standards and data privacy laws, and to improve civil \nregistration and vital statistics registers (CRVS), to allow for tracking of the \ntuberculosis epidemic, including drug-resistant forms, and its impact, with \ndisaggregation by age, sex and other characteristics relevant to national contexts, and \nto strengthen national capacity for the use and analysis of such data, including by \nimproving real-time data collection, reporting and automation, to inform and support \nevidence-based decision-making and strengthen accountability;  \n \n48. Pledge to accelerate progress towards timely, quality, universal access to \ntuberculosis services in both high- and low-burden countries, as outlined in the End \nTB Strategy, such that, by 2027: \n \n(a) \nAt least 90 per cent of the estimated number of people who develop \ntuberculosis are reached with quality-assured diagnosis and treatment, with all those \ndiagnosed having been initially tested with World Health Organization-recommended \nrapid molecular tests, and supported to complete treatment, which translates to \nproviding life-saving treatment for up to approximately 45 million people between \n2023 and 2027, including up to 4.5 million children and up to 1.5 million people with \ndrug-resistant tuberculosis; \n \n(b) \nAt least 90 per cent of people at high risk of developing tuberculosis are \nprovided with preventive treatment, which translates to providing up to \napproximately 45 million people with tuberculosis preventive treatment, including \napproximately 30 million household contacts of people with tuberculosis, including \nchildren and approximately 15 million people living with HIV, with the vision of \nreaching more people, including those who live in remote geographical regions or in \nareas difficult to access, taking into account World Health Organization guidance;  \n \n(c) \n100 per cent of people with tuberculosis have access to a health and social \nbenefits package so they do not have to endure financial hardship because of their \nillness; \n \n49.
