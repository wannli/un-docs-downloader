justice\n \n24-24212\n4/11 \n \n \nRecalling the commitment to establish appropriate safeguards to prevent and \naddress any adverse impact on human rights arising from the use of digital and \nemerging technologies and protect individuals against violations and abuses of their \nhuman rights in the digital space, including through human rights due diligence and \nestablishing effective oversight and remedy mechanisms, recently reaffirmed by \nMember States in the Global Digital Compact, as annexed to General Assembly \nresolution 79/1 of 22 September 2024, \n \nRecognizing the rapid advances in the design, development and use of digital \ntechnologies, including artificial intelligence systems, in various aspects of criminal \njustice systems, including the pretrial stage, during trials as well as after convictions, \n \nBearing in mind that the use of digital technology, including emerging \ninformation and communications technology, including artificial intelligence, can \nimprove the administration of justice but also has the potential to negatively affect \nhuman rights, \n \nEncouraging law enforcement, criminal justice and other relevant institutions \nto effectively and appropriately employ new and advanced technologies, including \nartificial intelligence, as tools against crime with adequate and effective safeguards \nto prevent the misuse and abuse of these technologies in this regard, and underscoring \nthe importance of designing and using artificial intelligence systems in such a way as \nto produce explainable and non-discriminatory results, \n \nRecognizing the importance of the principle that, except for those lawful \nlimitations that are demonstrably necessitated by the fact of incarceration, persons \ndeprived of their liberty shall retain their non-derogable human rights and all other \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms,  \n \nConcerned about the negative impact of overincarceration and overcrowding on \nthe enjoyment of human rights, and acknowledging that overincarceration constitutes \none of the major underlying causes of overcrowding, \n \nEmphasizing that the penitentiary system should provide the possibility of \nreform and social rehabilitation of the offender in all appropriate cases, and that \npunishment should be dealt with in the larger framework of a criminal justice system \nthat provides the possibility of reinsertion and reintegration of the offender into \nsociety,  \n \nRecalling that the social rehabilitation and reintegration of persons deprived of \ntheir liberty shall be among the essential aims of the criminal justice system, ensuring, \nas far as possible, that offenders are able to lead a law-abiding and self-supporting \nlife upon their return to society,  \n \nUnderlining that, where persons are in vulnerable situations or marginalized, \nprejudice and discrimination in the administration of justice may result in their \noverincarceration and overrepresentation throughout the criminal justice system, \nwhich could also potentially occur due to the use of digital technologies, including \nartificial intelligence, in the administration of justice, and recognizing the need for \nStates to take measures, within the justice system, particularly the criminal justice \nsystem, to prevent discrimination, inter alia, against persons with disabilities and \npersons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities and to \nincrease their effective participation within the system,  \n \nAware of the need for special vigilance with regard to the specific situation of \nchildren, juveniles, women, persons with disabilities, older persons, Indigenous \nPeoples, refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants, persons belonging to \nnational or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities and people who are in vulnerable \nsituations in the administration of justice, in particular while they are deprived of \n\nHuman rights in the administration of justice \nA/RES/79/172\n \n5/11\n24-24212 \n \ntheir liberty, and their risk of facing various forms of violence, abuse, injustice and \nhumiliation, \n \nReaffirming that children who are victims and witnesses of crime and violence \nare particularly vulnerable and require special protection, assistance and support \nappropriate to their age, level of maturity and needs, in order to prevent further \nhardship and trauma that may result from their participation in the criminal justice \nprocess,  \n \nRecognizing the specific situation and needs of children formerly associated \nwith armed forces or armed groups when accused of crimes under international law \nallegedly committed while they were children associated with armed forces or armed \ngroups,  \n \nReaffirming that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration \nin all actions concerning the child in the administration of justice, including in \nrelation to pretrial measures, as well as being an important consideration in all matters \nconcerning the child related to the sentencing of the parents, or, where applicable, \nlegal guardians or primary caregivers, \n

diligence, including regular, comprehensive human \nrights impact assessments of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, \nthroughout their life cycle, including their conception, design, development, \ndeployment, use, sale, procurement or operation, and notes in this regard the United \nNations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute Toolkit for Responsible \nArtificial Intelligence Innovation in Law Enforcement; \n \n(b) \nTo ensure that there are robust data protection laws aligned with the right \nto privacy where digital technologies and artificial intelligence are employed in the \nadministration of justice; \n \n(c) \nTo ensure the prevention of harm to individuals caused by artificial \nintelligence systems, and to refrain from or cease the use of artificial intelligence \napplications that are impossible to operate in compliance with international human \n__________________ \n \n26 A/79/296. \n \n27 A/HRC/42/20. \n\nA/RES/79/172 \nHuman

conception, design, use, deployment and further \ndevelopment of new and emerging technologies, such as those that involve artificial \nintelligence, may have an impact on human rights in the administration of justice, and \nthat the risks to these rights can and should be avoided and minimized by adapting or \nadopting adequate regulation or other appropriate mechanisms, in accordance with \napplicable obligations under international human rights law, for the conception, \ndesign, development and deployment of new and emerging technologies, including \nartificial intelligence, by taking measures to ensure a safe, transparent, accountable, \nsecure and high quality data infrastructure and by developing human rights-based \nauditing mechanisms and redress mechanisms and establishing human oversight;  \n \n7. \nExpresses concern that persons with disabilities may experience \ndisproportionately high levels of unlawful and arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and \nrecalls that persons with disabilities should not be deprived of their liberty unlawfully \nor arbitrarily, and that if persons with disabilities are deprived of their liberty through \nany process, they are, on an equal basis with others, entitled to guarantees in \naccordance with international human rights law, including by provision of reasonable \naccommodation; \n \n8. \nAppeals to Governments to include, in their efforts to implement the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development and in their national development plans, the \neffective administration of justice and equal access

Reaffirms that no one should be unlawfully or arbitrarily deprived of \nliberty, and notes that any deprivation should observe the principles of necessity and \nproportionality in this regard; \n\nHuman rights in the administration of justice \nA/RES/79/172\n \n7/11\n24-24212 \n \n \n13. Calls upon States to apply individual criminal responsibility and to refrain \nfrom detaining persons based solely on their family ties with an alleged offender; \n \n14. Also calls upon States to ensure that anyone who is deprived of liberty \nthrough arrest or detention has prompt access to a competent court with the effective \npower to determine the lawfulness of the detention and to order release if the detention \nor imprisonment is determined not to be lawful and prompt access to legal counsel, \nwhich could include legal aid schemes, in accordance with their international \nobligations and commitments; \n \n15.
