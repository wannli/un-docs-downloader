trafficking in persons, harassment, bias and discrimination against all \nwomen and girls that occur through or are amplified by the use of technology, \n \nRecognizing that digital technologies can

against women \nand girls in all its different forms and manifestations worldwide, offline and online, \nwhich is underrecognized and underreported, particularly at the community level, and \nits pervasiveness, which reflects discriminatory norms that reinforce stereotypes, \nincluding gender stereotypes and negative social norms, and gender inequality and \nthe corresponding impunity and lack of accountability, reiterating the need to \nintensify efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against all women and \ngirls, both offline and online, in the public and private spheres, and in all regions of \nthe world, and re-emphasizing that violence against women and girls violates, and \nimpairs their full enjoyment of, all human rights, \n \nExpressing grave concern that women

\ntechnologies, as well as the use and production of imbalanced and non-representative \ndata, which can lead to inaccuracies and biases in algorithms, in the training of smart \napplications \nand \nartificial \nintelligence-based \nsolutions, \nand \ntherefore \nto \ndiscrimination, including racial and gender-based discrimination, which in turn \ncontributes to the perpetuation of violence against women and girls, noting with \nfurther concern that this impacts the accuracy of facial recognition technologies, \nincluding for women and girls, and exacerbates racial inequalities, \n \nDeeply concerned by the impact of historical and structural inequalities, unequal \npower relations, gender stereotypes and negative social norms, perceptions and \ncustoms and disregard for women and girls\u2019 dignity, integrity and autonomy, that are \namong the primary causes of gender-based violence and harmful practices against \nwomen and girls and that reinforce the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in \nsociety, \n \nRecognizing that violence against women and girls is one of the fundamental \nsocial, political and economic means by which the position of women with respect to \nmen is regarded as subordinate and their stereotyped roles are perpetuated, and that \nthis violence is rooted in gender stereotypes and negative social norms, such as the \nideology of men\u2019s entitlement and privilege over women, and perceptions of \nmasculinity, including the need to assert male control or power, leading to the \njustification, normalization, condonement and perpetuation of violence and \nstigmatization of victims and survivors, \n \nRecognizing also the challenges and obstacles to eliminating discriminatory \nattitudes, gender stereotypes and negative social norms that perpetuate multiple and \nintersecting forms of discrimination against women and girls, and stressing that \nchallenges and obstacles remain in the implementation of international standards and \nnorms to eliminate gender inequality, \n \nExpressing deep concern at the continuing reports of grave abuses and violence \ncommitted against migrant women and girls, both online and offline, including sexual \nviolence, sexual exploitation and abuse, domestic violence, gender-related killings, \nincluding femicide, racist and xenophobic acts and expressions, discrimination, \nabusive labour practices, exploitative conditions of work and trafficking in persons, \nincluding forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, while \ntaking into account the particular difficulties in accessing justice that may be faced \nby women migrant workers and acknowledging the challenges in recognizing their \npositive contributions, \n \nExpressing its concern that incidents of racial and religious intolerance, \ndiscrimination and related violence against women and girls, because of negative \nracial and religious stereotyping, continue to rise around the world, including in the \ndigital environment, and condemning, in this context, any advocacy of national, racial \nor religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, \nand urging States to take effective measures, consistent with their obligations under \ninternational human rights law, to address and combat such incidents,  \n \nDeeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities face an increased risk \nof violence based on stereotypes that dehumanize, infantilize, objectify, exclude or \nisolate them, \n \nReaffirming the right to freely choose a spouse, to enter into marriage only with \nfree and full consent and to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on \nmatters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of \ncoercion, discrimination and violence, and recognizing that equal relationships in \nmatters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity,

to preventing and eliminating all forms of violence \nagainst all women and girls, \n \nNoting that women and girls experience, both offline and online, gender-specific \nviolations and abuses of their right to privacy, which is set forth in article 17 of the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and recognizing that the way in \nwhich many digital platforms are designed, commercialized, maintained and \ngoverned can give rise to disinformation, misinformation and hate speech, which can \nexacerbate gender stereotypes, disproportionately expose women and girls to various \nforms of violence, and undermine data protection and the realization of all women\u2019s \nand girls\u2019 rights, \n \nStressing the concern over the increasing misuse of social media, online digital \nplatforms and the Internet, as well as of digital technologies, to undermine women\u2019s \nand girls\u2019 rights, for example targeting their sexual and reproductive health and \nreproductive rights, which should be protected in accordance with the Programme of \nAction of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing \nPlatform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences, \n \nRecognizing the contributions of family members in combating violence against \nwomen and girls, including domestic violence and violence in the digital environment, \nand that in preventing such violence family members can play an important role, and \nemphasizing men\u2019s responsibilities as partners, parents and caregivers in the equal \nsharing of unpaid care and domestic work, as a means of enabling women to increase \ntheir participation in decision-making in public life and in the labour market, \n \nAcknowledging the role of civil society, in particular women\u2019s groups and \norganizations and other non-governmental organizations, of the private sector and of \nother relevant stakeholders, at all levels, in combating all forms of violence against \nwomen and girls that occur through or are amplified by the use of digital technologies, \n \nExpressing concern at institutional and structural discrimination against all \nwomen and girls, such as laws, policies, regulations, programmes, administrative \nprocedures or structures, services and practices that directly or indirectly restrict \naccess to institutions, property and landownership, inheritance, nationality, healthcare \nand services, education, justice, women\u2019s employment and access to credit, which \nplace them at increased risk of violence, and compound the violence experienced, and \nconstitute a major impediment to their full, equal, meaningful and effective \nparticipation in society, as well as economic and political life, \n \nRecognizing that women\u2019s poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their \nmarginalization resulting from their exclusion from social and economic policies and \nfrom the benefits of education and sustainable development, can place them at \nincreased risk of violence, and that violence against women and girls impedes the \nsocial and economic and therefore the sustainable development of communities and \nStates, as well as the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \nand other internationally agreed development goals, \n \nRecognizing also the importance of relevant International Labour Organization \nstandards related to the realization of women\u2019s right to work and rights at work which \nare critical for women\u2019s full and effective participation and decision-making in public \nlife and the elimination of violence, recalling the decent work agenda of the \nInternational Labour Organization and the International Labour Organization \nDeclaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and noting the importance \nof their effective implementation, \n \nStressing the need to eliminate gender stereotypes and negative social norms in \nthe world of work that condone violence against women and girls, including through, \n\nA/RES/79/152 \nIntensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of \nviolence against women and girls: the digital environment\n \n24-24142\n6/16 \n \nbut not limited to, quality education, training and awareness-raising campaigns, \nassociated with a change in attitudes and increased knowledge about sexual \nharassment, particularly among men and boys, as well as ensuring equal pay for work \nof equal value and reaffirming the necessity of recognizing, valuing, reducing and \nredistributing unpaid care and domestic work, \n \nRecognizing the need to ensure that human rights are promoted, respected, \nprotected and fulfilled through the entirety of digital technologies\u2019 life cycle, \nincluding through their conception, design, development, deployment, use, evaluation \nand regulation, and to ensure that they are subject to adequate safeguards in order to \npromote a free, open, universal, interoperable, safe, secure, stable, accessible and \naffordable digital environment for all, \n \nRecognizing also that educational opportunities, awareness-raising and training, \nincluding in the fields of digital literacy and online safety, as well as equal access to \ngender-responsive education addressing consent, respecting boundaries and what \nconstitutes unacceptable behaviour and how to report it, are effective ways to prevent \nand eliminate violence against women and girls, to combat gender stereotypes and \nnegative social norms, and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all \nwomen and girls, women\u2019s formal employment and economic opportunities and their \nactive participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and \ndecision-making, \n \nExpressing deep concern over the growing number of groups, including incels, \ninciting to and engaging in abuses in the digital environment, including sexual \nharassment of women and girls, and emphasizing that there is evidence to suggest \nthat online violence against women and girls or incitement to such violence often \nprecedes violence carried out against women and girls offline, \n \nRecognizing that images, videos and other content in the digital environment of \nwomen and girls and violence against them, in particular those that depict rape, sexual \nexploitation or sexual slavery, and including the creation and sharing of, or \nthreatening to share, real or simulated intimate content, such as deepfakes, of girls \nand, especially when non-consensual, of women, are factors contributing to the \ncontinued prevalence of such violence, and that the arts, media and other forms of \ncommunication can exacerbate, maintain or combat gender stereotypes and negative \nsocial norms, \n \nRecognizing also that the growing impact of violence against women and girls, \nincluding sexual harassment and abuse, in digital contexts, especially on social media, \nits impunity and the lack of legislative and preventive measures and remedies \nunderline the need for action by Member States, in partnership with relevant \nstakeholders, and that such violence may include stalking, death threats and threats \nof sexual and gender-based violence, as well as related trends against women and \ngirls in digital contexts, such as trolling, cyberbullying and other forms of \ncyberharassment, including unwanted verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual \nnature, arbitrary or unlawful surveillance and tracking, trafficking in persons, \nextortion, censorship and the hacking of digital accounts, mobile telephones and other \nelectronic devices, limiting women\u2019s equal participation in public life, including \nthrough discrediting or silencing women and girls, compromising their health, \nemotional and psychological well-being and safety and/or inciting other violations \nand abuses against them, \n \nExpressing concern about the increased exposure of women and girls to all \nforms of violence in the digital environment, including harassment and any forms of \nsexual abuse online, and expressing further concern that the use of artificial \nintelligence can have far-reaching implications and cause disproportionate negative \n\nIntensification of efforts

technologies that create \nnew forms of violence, such as deepfakes, \n \nNoting with concern the misuse of digital technologies for the purpose of any \nforms of child sexual exploitation and abuse, of child trafficking, of child, early and \nforced marriage and forced labour, of the production and distribution of child sexual \nexploitation and abuse material, or of the exploitation of the prostitution of others, \nwhile acknowledging the role that information and communications technologies can \nplay in reducing the risk of sexual abuse and exploitation, including by empowering \nwomen and girls to report such abuses, \n \nNoting the fact that several countries have criminalized the non-consensual \nonline dissemination of intimate or sexually explicit images of adult persons, ensuring \nthat victims do not have to rely solely on other criminal law provisions, \n \nRecognizing the transnational nature of violence in the digital environment, the \ncontinual and diverse use and adaptation of digital technologies by perpetrators to \navoid detection and investigation, and the role that the misuse of pseudonymity can \nplay in facilitating digital violence, and in this regard recognizing the need to \nstrengthen law enforcement capacity and training to conduct trauma-informed \ninvestigations into violence in the digital environment and to develop coordinated \napproaches to hold perpetrators liable, \n \nRecognizing also the contribution of digitalization to the full, equal and \nmeaningful participation and involvement of women in peace processes, conflict \nprevention, conflict resolution and peacebuilding, and the role that digital \ntechnologies can play to support the pursuit of peace and security, \n \nAlarmed by the fact that violence against women and girls, including gender-\nrelated killings of women and girls, also known as femicide, which constitutes an \nextreme form of violence against women and girls, is among the least punished crimes \nowing to, inter alia, gender bias among the judiciary and law enforcement, \nrecognizing the key role of the criminal justice system, including law enforcement \nofficials, in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls, including \nin ending impunity for such crimes and ensuring accountability, including at the \ninternational level, \n \nRecognizing that women human rights defenders, politicians, journalists and \nother media workers, and women in leadership positions that challenge accepted \nsociocultural norms, traditions, perceptions and stereotypes, including gender \nstereotypes and negative social norms, are at greater risk of facing certain forms of \nviolence, and gravely concerned that impunity for violations and abuses against them \npersists owing to factors such as a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and \naccess to justice, social barriers and constraints with regard to addressing sexual and \ngender-based violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and \nabuses, \n \nDeeply concerned that all women and girls, especially in developing countries, \nincluding small island developing States, and particularly those in vulnerable \nsituations, are often disproportionately affected by the adverse impacts of climate \nchange, environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, extreme weather events and \nnatural disasters and other environmental issues, which may exacerbate existing \nstructural inequalities as well as violence against women and girls and harmful \npractices, including the incidence of child, early and forced marriage and female \ngenital mutilation, and emphasizing the lack of sufficient data and understanding of \nthe impact of climate change and environmental degradation on violence against \nwomen and girls, \n\nA/RES/79/152 \nIntensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of \nviolence against women and girls: the digital environment\n \n24-24142\n8/16 \n \n \nRecognizing that all women and girls, especially victims and survivors of all \nforms of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, living in areas \naffected by complex humanitarian emergencies and in areas affected by terrorism and \nconflict, have particular needs, including regarding their physical, mental, sexual and \nreproductive health, and that global health threats, climate change, water scarcity, \nmore frequent and intense natural disasters, conflicts, violent extremism as and when \nconducive to terrorism, and related humanitarian crises and the forced displacement \nof people threaten to reverse much of the development progress made in recent \ndecades and have particular negative impacts on women and girls that need to be \ncomprehensively assessed and addressed, \n \nStressing that men and boys need to support and take concrete actions for more \nequal power relations, and therefore stressing the need to fully engage men and boys \nas strategic partners, allies and beneficiaries in achieving gender equality and the \nempowerment of all women and girls and in preventing and eliminating all forms of \nsexual and gender-based violence, both online and offline, including by combating \ngender stereotypes and negative social norms, such as patriarchal masculinity, sexism \nand misogyny, \n \nRecognizing the need to promote the full, effective, equal and meaningful \nparticipation of women in all their diversity and women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights \norganizations and women\u2019s organizations, including victims and survivors of violence, \nin the development, implementation and evaluation of gender-responsive policies, \nregulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence \nagainst women and girls and to allow civil society to operate freely and safely, \n \n1. \nStrongly condemns all forms of violence against all women and girls, \nwhich often occur in a continuum and throughout the life course, and their persistence \nand pervasiveness, recognizing that they are an impediment to the achievement of \ngender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and to the full \nrealization of their human rights; \n \n2. \nStresses that \u201cviolence against women and girls\u201d means any act of \nviolence, including sexual and gender-based violence, that results in, or is likely to \nresult in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women \nand girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, \nwhether occurring in public or in private life, online and offline, and notes the \neconomic and social harm caused by such violence; \n \n3. \nUrges States to strongly condemn all forms of violence against women and \ngirls, both offline and online, and reaffirms that they should not invoke any custom, \ntradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its \nelimination and should pursue, by all appropriate means and without delay, a policy \nof eliminating all forms of violence against women, as set out in the Declaration on \nthe Elimination of Violence against Women; \n \n4. \nCalls upon States to address multiple and intersecting forms of \ndiscrimination, which place women and girls at greater risk of exploitation, violence \nand abuse, to implement measures to prevent and eliminate gender stereotypes, \nnegative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that cause or perpetuate \ndiscrimination and violence against women and girls and to ensure the full, equal and \nmeaningful participation and leadership in decision-making processes of all women \nand, as appropriate, girls; \n \n5. \nUrges
