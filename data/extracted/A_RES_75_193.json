\nviolations of international humanitarian law, including by the starvation of civilians \nas a method of warfare and the use of chemical weapons, including sarin and chlorine \ngas, and sulfur

sustainable solution to the current crisis in the Syrian \nArab Republic is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, under the \nauspices of the United Nations, that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian \npeople, and the establishment of a constitutional committee that would prepare the \nwork for free and fair elections and political transition in line with Security Council \nresolution 2254 (2015), with a view to establishing credible, inclusive and \nnon-sectarian governance, with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women \nand youth, welcoming the

the culture of impunity from within the Syrian regime \nfor the most serious violations of international law and violations and abuses of \nhuman rights law committed during the present conflict, some of which rise to the \nlevel of war crimes and crimes against humanity, which has provided a fertile ground \nfor further violations and abuses, \n \nEmphasizing the importance of accountability for the most serious crimes in \nviolation of international law committed during the conflict for ensuring sustainable \npeace, \n \nRecalling that, amid expressions of popular discontent over restrictions on the \nenjoyment of civil, political, economic and social rights, civilian protests erupted in \nDar\u2019a in March 2011, and noting that the violent oppression of civilian protests by \nthe Syrian regime, which later escalated to the direct shelling of civilians, fuelled the \nescalation of armed violence and the rise of violent extremist groups and terrorist \ngroups, \n \nRecalling also all relevant resolutions on the safety and security of humanitarian \npersonnel and the protection of United Nations personnel, including its resolution \n73/137 of 14 December 2018, as well as Security Council resolutions on the \nprotection of humanitarian personnel, including resolution 2175 (2014) of 29 August \n2014, the relevant statements by the President of the Security Council referring to the \nspecific obligations under international humanitarian law to respect and protect, in \nsituations of armed conflict, all medical personnel and humanitarian workers

practicable and with the least possible delay, the medical care and \nattention required, and condemning attacks against hospitals and places where the \nsick and wounded are collected, including makeshift hospitals, as well as attacks \nagainst medical personnel and humanitarian workers that are in violation of \ninternational humanitarian law, \n \nExpressing grave concern at the indiscriminate use of force by the Syrian regime \nagainst civilians, which has caused immense human suffering and fomented the \nspread of violent extremism and violent extremist groups and which demonstrates the \ncontinuing failure of the Syrian regime to protect the population and implement the \nrelevant resolutions and decisions of United Nations bodies and has created a safe \nhaven and operating environment for war crimes and crimes against humanity, \n \nExpressing grave concern also at the remaining presence of violent extremism \nand violent extremist groups, terrorists and terrorist groups, and strongly condemning \nall violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian \nlaw committed in the Syrian Arab Republic by any party to the

Republic that non-State armed groups still \nresort to the use of force against civilians, \n \nReaffirming its condemnation in the strongest possible terms of the use of \nchemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances, emphasizing that any use of \nchemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, under any circumstances is \nunacceptable and is and would be a violation of international law, and expressing its \nstrong conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons \nmust and should be held accountable, \n \nCondemning in the strongest possible terms the fact that chemical weapons have \nbeen used since 2012 in the Syrian Arab Republic, including as reported in April 2020 \nby the Investigation and Identification Team of the Organisation for the Prohibition \nof Chemical Weapons, which concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe \nthat the Syrian Air Force had carried out three chemical weapons attacks in Ltamenah \nduring March 2017, welcoming the decision adopted on 9 July 2020 by the Executive \nCouncil of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, 34 in which the \nExecutive Council condemned the use by the Syrian Arab Republic of chemical \nweapons in Ltamenah and requested that the Syrian Arab Republic take steps to \nredress the situation within 90 days, regretting the failure of the Syrian Arab Republic \nto reply to this request, recalling the report of 26 October 2017 of the Organisation \nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative \nMechanism,35 which concluded that the Syrian Arab Air Force had been responsible \nfor the use of the chemical weapon sarin on 4 April 2017 in Khan Shaykhun, and the \nreport of 24 August 2016 of the Mechanism,36 which concluded that the Syrian Arab \nArmed Forces had been responsible for the attacks that released toxic substances in \nTalmenes in 2014 and in Sarmin and Qmenas in 2015 and that ISIL (also known as \nDa\u2019esh) had used sulfur mustard in Marea in 2015 and in Umm Hawsh in 2016, \naccordingly noting with great concern the reports of the fact-finding mission of the \nOrganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons regarding incidents in Saraqib, \nand involving alleged use of toxic chemicals as a weapon in Duma, which concluded \nthat there were reasonable grounds to believe that the use of a toxic chemical as a \nweapon had taken place, and demanding that the perpetrators immediately desist from \nany further use of chemical weapons, \n \nExpressing support for the work carried out by the Independent International \nCommission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, welcoming its reports, strongly \ncondemning the lack of cooperation by the Syrian regime with the Commission of \nInquiry, reiterating its decision to transmit the reports of the Commission of Inquiry \nto the Security Council, expressing its appreciation to the Commission of Inquiry for \nits briefings to members of the Security Council, and requesting that the Commission \nof Inquiry continue to brief the General Assembly and members of the Security \nCouncil, \n \nWelcoming the reports

human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic\n \n20-17352\n6/18 \n \nthat, since March 2011, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian regime \nhas conducted widespread and systemic attacks against the civilian population \namounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity, including targeted attacks on \nprotected persons and objects, including medical facilities, and personnel and \ntransport and blocked humanitarian convoys, as well as enforced disappearances, \ntorture in detention, arbitrary detentions, summary executions and other violations \nand abuses, and underscoring the need for those allegations to be examined and \nevidence to be collected and made available for future accountability efforts, \n \nStrongly condemning the reported killing of detainees in Syrian military \nintelligence facilities and the widespread practice of enforced disappearance, \narbitrary detention and the use of sexual and gender-based violence and torture in \ndetention centres referred to in the reports of the Commission of Inquiry, including, \nbut not limited to, Branch 215, Branch 227, Branch 235, Branch 251, the Air Force \nIntelligence Investigation Branch at Mazzah military airport and Saydnaya prison, \nincluding the practice of mass hangings by the regime, as well as the killing of \ndetainees at military hospitals, including Tishrin and Harasta hospitals,  \n \nRecalling the statements made by the Secretary-General, the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the special procedures of the Human \nRights Council that crimes against humanity and war crimes are likely to have been \ncommitted in the Syrian Arab Republic, noting the repeated encouragement by the \nHigh Commissioner for the Security Council to refer the situation to the International \nCriminal Court, and regretting that a draft resolution 38 was not adopted \nnotwithstanding broad support from Member States,  \n \nRecalling also the report of 6 April 2020 of the United Nations Board of \nInquiry39 into strikes that damaged and destroyed health-care facilities in the north-\nwest of the Syrian Arab Republic, including sites whose coordinates had been \nrecorded on the United Nations deconfliction list as a step to ensure that they would \nnot be targeted or impacted by violence, and which in most instances examined, \nconcluded that it was \u201chighly probable that the strikes had been carried out by the \nGovernment of the Syrian Arab Republic and/or its allies\u201d and found that health-care \nservices were being provided at the time of some of the strikes and that there were no \narmed opposition groups in or near the facilities, and calling on all parties to adhere \nto and comply with the deconfliction mechanism, \n \nCalling for the immediate repeal of Law No. 10/2018, concerned about the \nSyrian regime\u2019s infringement on the housing, land and property of Syrians, \nparticularly through the dispossession of displaced Syrians\u2019 land and property in the \nnational legislation and similar measures, which would have a significant detrimental \nimpact on the rights of Syrians displaced by the conflict to claim their property and \nto return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner when the situation \non the ground allows it, and expressing concern about reports of armed groups\u2019 abuses \nof Syrians\u2019 housing, land and property rights in areas under their control, \n \nDeploring in this regard the existence and application of national legislation, in \nparticular Law No. 42/2018 and other legislation and practices concerning housing, \nland and property rights, which have a significant detrimental impact on the rights of \nSyrians displaced by the conflict to claim their property, as evidenced by continuing \nreports of widespread demolition of property in areas formerly controlled by the \nSyrian opposition as well as the confiscation of property owned by arbitrarily detained \nand missing persons throughout the Syrian Arab Republic, calling for the immediate \nrepeal of that legislation, and stressing the right of everyone, including displaced

safe, full, immediate, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access \nthroughout the Syrian Arab Republic, \n \nEmphasizing that the humanitarian cross-border mechanism remains an \nessential and life-saving channel to address the humanitarian needs of a significant \nportion of the population of the Syrian Arab Republic, which cannot be reached \nthrough existing operations within the Syrian Arab Republic, and emphasizing also \nthat an immediate and significant improvement to cross-line access and respect for \nprincipled humanitarian action are essential to prevent further unnecessary suffering \nand loss of life, \n \nExpressing grave concern at the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic and about United Nations reports on rising numbers of death notices and \nburials which seem to indicate that actual COVID-19 cases in the Syrian Arab \nRepublic far exceed official figures, recognizing that the pandemic presents a \nprofound challenge to the decimated health system, socioeconomic and humanitarian \nsituations of the Syrian Arab Republic, underlining that the grave risk posed by \nCOVID-19 heightens the imperative of using every possible means, including the \ncross-border mechanism, to reach people in need without preconditions and \ndiscrimination, calling for the provision of humanitarian assistance to all parts of the \nSyrian Arab Republic, including in areas where humanitarian needs are especially \nurgent, and stressing the importance of accurate and timely data collection and \nreporting, \n \nRecalling its commitment to

have been forced to flee the Syrian Arab Republic and that \n11.1 million people in the Syrian Arab Republic, of whom 5.9 million are internally \ndisplaced, require urgent humanitarian assistance, which has resulted in an influx of \nSyrian refugees into neighbouring countries, other countries in the region and beyond, \nand alarmed at the risk the situation presents to regional and international stability, \n \nExpressing its profound indignation at the death of more than 17,000 children \nand the many more injured since the beginning of the peaceful protests in March 2011,

and rape and other forms of sexual violence, attacks \non schools and hospitals, and denial of humanitarian access, as well as their arbitrary \narrest, detention, torture and ill-treatment and their use as human shields, and noting \nin this regard the adoption on 18 July 2019 of the Security Council Working Group \non Children and Armed Conflict conclusions on children and armed conflict in the \nSyrian Arab Republic40 as well as the report of 13 January 2020 of the Independent \nInternational Commission of Inquiry entitled \u201cThey have erased the dreams of my \nchildren: children\u2019s
