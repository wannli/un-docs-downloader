is the primary objective of the Kimberley Process, and stressing the need to \ncontinue its activities in order to achieve this objective, \n \nRecognizing that the Kimberley Process promotes legitimate rough diamond \ntrade, and recalling the positive benefits of legitimate diamond trade to producing \ncountries, including its transparency and accountability throughout the diamond \nindustry, and the contribution it has made to the economies of producing, exporting \nand importing States, and therefore underlining the need for continued international \naction with regard to the ethical exploitation, sale and trade of rough diamonds, \n \nWelcoming the efforts to enhance regional cooperation on Kimberley Process \nmatters among artisanal and alluvial diamond-producing countries in Central Africa \nand the Mano River Union facing similar challenges, and further encouraging the \nsharing of lessons with partners in the region and outside, \n \nAcknowledging the
