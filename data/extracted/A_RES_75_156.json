\nExpressing concern that women and girls continue to carry a disproportionate \nshare of unpaid care, which needs to be addressed, and in this regard expressing \nfurther concern that, when taking

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on women and girls \nA/RES/75/156\n \n3/7\n20-17289 \n \n \nAcknowledging that women and girls have specific health needs, that during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic they must have equal access to COVID-19 prevention, \nmitigation and treatment interventions, as well as access to essential, safe, affordable, \neffective and quality medicines and vaccines for all and effective primary health care, \nespecially in indigenous and rural communities, and that negative social norms and \ngender stereotypes can have particular impacts during a widespread health crisis, \n \nExpressing concern that the spread of COVID-19 and its socioeconomic impact \ncan negatively affect mental health, aggravated by factors such as job loss or wage \ncuts, inadequate or lack of nutritious food, and lack of access to safe water and \nsanitation and commodities, as well as additional responsibilities due to the closure \nof schools and care facilities, \n \nDeeply concerned that the negative socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 \npandemic poses a serious threat to the progress that has been made in women\u2019s economic \nempowerment, economic autonomy and productive lives, and may affect them \ndisproportionately and differently from men, as they often earn less, save less, have less \naccess to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, have less access \nto credit and hold less secure jobs, they are also more likely to be employed in the \ninformal sector, which leads to less access to social protection and pensions, and are at \ngreater risk of falling into poverty, in particular when entitlements are tied closely to \nformal employment, they represent the majority of single-parent households, bear the \nmajority of domestic and unpaid care work and spend longer hours than men on unpaid \ncare work, and as they take on greater care demands at home, their jobs and income can \nalso be disproportionately affected by cuts and layoffs, especially since households \nheaded by women are far more likely to be economically disadvantaged, in particular in \nterms of exacerbating their risk of exposure to COVID-19, \n \nRecognizing that school closures, physical distancing and containment \nstrategies may affect girls and boys differently, especially adolescent girls, who, \nowing to negative social norms, are more likely to be expected to take on unpaid care \nand domestic work, limiting their access to remote learning and other education \nsupport programmes, and may put them at a greater risk of being subjected to harmful \npractices, such as child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, as well \nas sexual and gender-based violence, child labour and trafficking in persons, which \nmay lead to girls, and in particular girls living in poverty, girls with disabilities, \nindigenous girls, migrants, refugees and those living in rural and remote areas, leaving \nschool before the completion of their education, \n \nNoting with concern that, owing to school closures, the COVID-19 crisis has \nexposed the digital divide, both between and within countries, including the gender \ndigital divide and vast disparities in the availability of learning materials, including \naccess to the Internet, and communication devices, and that even though much focus \nhas turned to remote learning platforms, many public schools, especially in \ndeveloping countries, are not set up to use them or do not have the technology and \nequipment to provide online teaching, which leads to limited or lack of education for \nmany children, especially girls, \n \nDeeply concerned by the increase in cases of gender-based violence, including \ndomestic violence, as a result of lockdown measures, the lack of availability of \nprotection services and the increased challenges to holding perpetrators accountable, \nwhich also affect front-line health workers and community health volunteers, \n \nStressing the importance of the systematic collection and use of quality, timely and \nreliable data disaggregated by sex, age, disability and other characteristics relevant in \nnational contexts as an essential tool for the design, implementation and evaluation of \neffective policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the recovery, \n\nA/RES/75/156 \nStrengthening national and international rapid response to the \nimpact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on women and girls\n \n20-17289\n4/7 \n \n \nCondemning social stigma and discriminatory behaviours against those infected \nwith COVID-19, which can negatively affect their caregivers, family members, \nfriends and communities, and recognizing that addressing those challenges is also a \ncritical element in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, \n \nConcerned at the proliferation of disinformation and misinformation about the \npandemic, especially in the digital space, and stressing the importance of providing \ndata and information to the public to counter such practices, \n \nRecognizing the fundamental role of the United Nations system in catalysing \nand coordinating the comprehensive global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and \nthe central efforts of Member States therein, recalling the constitutional mandate of \nthe World Health Organization to act, inter alia, as the directing and coordinating \nauthority on international health work, and recognizing its key leadership role within \nthe broader United Nations response and the importance of strengthened multilateral \ncooperation in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and its extensive negative impacts, \n \n1. \nPledges to take further concrete action to ensure the full, effective and \naccelerated implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and \nthe Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and \nDevelopment during the response to the pandemic,

when designing, implementing and \nmonitoring such measures, policies and strategies, in meaningful consultation with \nand with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and, where
