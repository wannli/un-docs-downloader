bottom, \nproviding ecosystem support through food, shelter and essential nursery areas for \ncommercial and recreational fish species, turtles, dugongs, manatees and a number of \ninvertebrates living in seagrass communities, enhancing water quality and preventing \ncoastal erosion,  \n \nRecalling the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable \nDevelopment, 2021\u20132030, and the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration \n(2021\u20132030),  \n \nRecalling also the fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the \nConvention on Biological Diversity, held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, from 17 to \n29 November 2018, and its decision 14/8 of 29 November 2018, 1 which suggests \nsteps for enhancing and supporting the mainstreaming of protected areas and other \neffective area-based conservation measures across sectors, including, among others, \nto identify, map and prioritize areas important for essential ecosystem functions and \nservices, including ecosystems that are important for food, for climate change \nmitigation and adaptation, for water availability, for poverty alleviation and for \ndisaster risk reduction,  \n \nWelcoming the convening of the first part of the fifteenth meeting of the \nConference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, in Kunming, \nChina, from 11 to 15 October 2021, under the theme proposed by

\nAcknowledging the urgent need to raise awareness at all levels and to promote \nand facilitate actions for the conservation of seagrasses in order to contribute to their \nhealth and development, bearing in mind that enhancing ecosystem services and \nfunctions is important for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,  \n \nTaking note of the 2020 report of the United Nations Environment Programme \nentitled Out of the Blue: The Value of Seagrasses to the Environment and to People \nand the recommendations for seagrass conservation contained therein,  \n \nRecognizing with concern that the adverse impacts of climate change are a threat \nto marine biodiversity and ecosystem health, and recognizing that the conservation of \nseagrasses positively contributes to climate change adaptation, mitigation and disaster \nrisk reduction while supporting food security, human well-being and livelihoods,  \n \nRecognizing the carbon sequestration and storage potential of seagrass \necosystems, as a critical component of marine ecosystems, and that adopting measures \nto protect them can help to contribute to the achievement of the goals and objectives \nof the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 2 and the Paris \nAgreement,3  \n \nRecognizing also that seagrasses, as a part of the marine ecosystem, provide \npowerful nature-based solutions to tackle climate change impacts and store up to \n18 per cent of the world\u2019s oceanic carbon,  \n \nAcknowledging that only 26 per cent of recorded seagrass meadows fall within \nmarine protected areas,  \n__________________ \n \n1  See United Nations Environment Programme, document CBD/COP/14/14, sect.
