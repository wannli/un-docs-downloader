These rules also apply as customary international law. \n2. \nA treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary \nmeaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and \npurpose, as provided in article 31, paragraph 1. \n3. \nArticle 31, paragraph 3, provides, inter alia, that there shall be taken into \naccount, together with the context, (a) any subsequent agreement between the parties \nregarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions; and \n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the \nagreement of the parties regarding its interpretation. \n4. \nRecourse may be had to other subsequent practice in the application of the treaty \nas a supplementary means of interpretation under article 32. \n5. \nThe interpretation of a treaty consists of a single combined operation, which \nplaces appropriate emphasis on the various means of interpretation indicated, \nrespectively, in articles 31 and 32. \n__________________ \n \n3  See A/C.6/73/SR.20, A/C.6/73/SR.21, A/C.6/73/SR.22, A/C.6/73/SR.23, A/C.6/73/SR.24, \nA/C.6/73/SR.29 and A/C.6/73/SR.30; see also the statements in the Sixth Committee that are \navailable on the United Nations PaperSmart portal. \n\nSubsequent agreements and subsequent practice \nin relation to the interpretation of treaties \nA/RES/73/202\n \n3/5\n18-22464 \n \n \n \nConclusion 3 \n \n \nSubsequent agreements and subsequent practice as authentic means \nof interpretation \n \n \nSubsequent \nagreements \nand \nsubsequent \npractice \nunder \narticle 31, \nparagraph 3 (a) and (b), being objective evidence of the understanding of the parties \nas to the meaning of the treaty, are authentic means of interpretation, in the application \nof the general rule of treaty interpretation reflected in article 31. \n \n \n \nConclusion 4 \n \n \nDefinition of subsequent agreement and subsequent practice \n \n1. \nA subsequent agreement as an authentic means of interpretation under article 31, \nparagraph 3 (a), is an agreement between the parties, reached after the conclusion of \na treaty, regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions. \n2. \nA subsequent practice as an authentic means of interpretation under article 31, \nparagraph 3 (b), consists of conduct in the application of a treaty, after its conclusion, \nwhich establishes the agreement of the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty. \n3. \nA subsequent practice as a supplementary means of interpretation under \narticle 32 consists of conduct by one or more parties in the application of the treaty, \nafter its conclusion. \n \n \n \nConclusion 5 \n \n \nConduct as subsequent practice \n \n1. \nSubsequent practice under articles 31 and 32 may consist of any conduct of a \nparty in the application of a treaty, whether in the exercise of its executive, legislative, \njudicial or other functions. \n2. \nOther conduct, including by non-State actors, does not constitute subsequent \npractice under articles 31 and 32. Such conduct may, however, be relevant when \nassessing the subsequent practice of parties to a treaty. \n \n \n \nPart Three \n \n \nGeneral aspects \n \n \n \nConclusion 6 \n \n \nIdentification of subsequent agreements and subsequent practice \n \n1. \nThe identification of subsequent agreements and subsequent practice under \narticle 31, paragraph 3, requires, in particular, a determination whether the parties, by \nan agreement or a practice, have taken a position regarding the interpretation of the \ntreaty. Such a position is not taken if the parties have merely agreed not to apply the \ntreaty temporarily or agreed to establish a practical arrangement (modus vivendi). \n2. \nSubsequent agreements and subsequent practice under article 31, paragraph 3, \nmay take a variety of forms. \n3. \nThe identification of subsequent practice under article 32 requires, in particular, \na determination whether conduct by one or more parties is in the application of the \ntreaty. \n \n \n \nConclusion 7 \n \n \nPossible effects of subsequent agreements and subsequent practice \nin interpretation \n \n1. \nSubsequent agreements and subsequent practice under article 31, paragraph 3, \ncontribute, in their interaction with other means of interpretation, to the clarification \n\nA/RES/73/202 \nSubsequent agreements and subsequent practice\nin relation to the interpretation of treaties\n \n18-22464\n4/5 \n \nof the meaning of a treaty. This may result in narrowing, widening, or otherwise \ndetermining the range of possible interpretations, including any scope for the exercise \nof discretion which the treaty accords to the parties. \n2. \nSubsequent practice under article 32 may also contribute to the clarification of \nthe meaning of a treaty. \n3. \nIt is presumed that the parties to a treaty, by an agreement or a practice in the \napplication of the treaty, intend to interpret the treaty, not to amend or to modify it. \nThe possibility of amending or modifying a treaty by subsequent practice of the \nparties has not been generally recognized. The present conclusion is without prejudice \nto the rules on the amendment or modification of treaties under the Vienna \nConvention on the Law of Treaties and under customary international law. \n \n \n \nConclusion 8 \n \n \nInterpretation of treaty terms as capable of evolving over time \n \n \nSubsequent agreements and subsequent practice under articles 31 and 32 may \nassist in determining whether or not the presumed intention of the parties upon the \nconclusion of the treaty was to give a term used a meaning which is capable of \nevolving over time. \n \n \n \nConclusion 9 \n \n \nWeight of subsequent agreements and subsequent practice as a means \nof interpretation \n \n1. \nThe weight of a subsequent agreement or subsequent practice as a means of \ninterpretation under article 31, paragraph 3, depends, inter alia, on its clarity and \nspecificity. \n2. \nIn addition, the weight of subsequent practice under article 31, paragraph 3 (b), \ndepends, inter alia, on whether and how it is repeated. \n3. \nThe weight of subsequent practice as a supplementary means of interpretation \nunder article 32 may depend on the criteria referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. \n \n \n \nConclusion 10 \n \n \nAgreement of the parties regarding the interpretation of a treaty \n \n1. \nAn agreement under article 31, paragraph 3 (a) and (b), requires a common \nunderstanding regarding the interpretation of a treaty which the parties are aware of \nand accept. Such an agreement may, but need not, be legally binding for it to be taken \ninto account. \n2. \nThe number of parties that must actively engage in subsequent practice in order \nto establish an agreement under article 31, paragraph 3 (b), may vary. Silence on the \npart of one or more parties may constitute acceptance of the subsequent practice when \nthe circumstances call for some reaction. \n \n \n \nPart Four \n \n \nSpecific aspects \n \n \n \nConclusion 11 \n \n \nDecisions adopted within the framework of a Conference of States Parties \n \n1. \nA Conference of States Parties, under these conclusions, is a meeting of parties \nto a treaty for the purpose of reviewing or implementing the treaty, except where they \nact as members of an organ of an international organization. \n\nSubsequent agreements and subsequent practice \nin relation to the interpretation of treaties \nA/RES/73/202\n \n5/5\n18-22464 \n \n2. \nThe legal effect of a decision adopted within the framework of a Conference of \nStates Parties depends primarily on the treaty and any applicable rules of procedure. \nDepending on the circumstances, such a decision may embody, explicitly or \nimplicitly, a subsequent agreement under article 31, paragraph 3 (a), or give rise to \nsubsequent practice under article 31, paragraph 3 (b), or to subsequent practice under \narticle 32. Decisions adopted within the framework of a Conference of States Parties \noften provide a non-exclusive range of practical options for implementing the treaty. \n3. \nA decision adopted within the framework of a Conference of States Parties \nembodies a subsequent agreement or subsequent practice under article 31, \nparagraph 3, in so far as it expresses agreement in substance between the parties \nregarding the interpretation of a treaty, regardless of the form and the procedure by \nwhich the decision was adopted, including adoption by consensus. \n \n \n \nConclusion 12 \n \n \nConstituent instruments of international organizations \n \n1. \nArticles 31 and 32 apply to a treaty which is the constituent instrument of an \ninternational organization. Accordingly, subsequent agreements and subsequent \npractice under article 31, paragraph 3, are, and subsequent practice under article 32 \nmay be, means of interpretation for such treaties. \n2. \nSubsequent agreements and subsequent practice of the parties under article 31, \nparagraph 3, or subsequent practice under article 32, may arise from, or be expressed \nin, the practice of an international organization in the application of its constituent \ninstrument. \n3. \nPractice of an international organization in the application of its constituent \ninstrument may contribute to the interpretation of that instrument when applying \narticles 31 and 32. \n4. \nParagraphs 1 to 3 apply to the interpretation of any treaty which is the \nconstituent instrument of an international organization without prejudice to any \nrelevant rules of the organization. \n \n \n \nConclusion 13 \n \n \nPronouncements of expert treaty bodies \n \n1. \nFor the purposes of these conclusions, an expert treaty body is a body consisting \nof experts serving in their personal capacity, which is established under a treaty and \nis not an organ of an international organization. \n2. \nThe relevance of a pronouncement of an expert treaty body for the interpretation \nof a treaty is subject to the applicable rules of the treaty. \n3. \nA pronouncement of an expert treaty body may give rise to, or refer to, a \nsubsequent agreement or subsequent practice by parties under article 31, paragraph 3, \nor subsequent practice under article 32. Silence by a party shall not be presumed to \nconstitute subsequent practice under article 31, paragraph 3 (b), accepting an \ninterpretation of a treaty as expressed in a pronouncement of an expert treaty body. \n4. \nThis conclusion is without prejudice to the contribution that pronouncements of \nexpert treaty bodies make to the interpretation of the treaties under their mandates. \n \n",
