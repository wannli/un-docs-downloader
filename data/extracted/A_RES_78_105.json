Code of Conduct for Arbitrators in International Investment \nDispute Resolution and Code of Conduct for Judges in \nInternational Investment Dispute Resolution with respective \ncommentary of the United Nations Commission on International \nTrade Law \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecalling its resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, by which it established \nthe United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with a mandate to further \nthe progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade and in \nthat respect to bear in mind the interests of all peoples, in particular those of developing \ncountries, in the extensive development of international trade,  \n \nNoting that the Commission, at its fiftieth session, in 2017, entrusted its \nWorking Group III (Investor-State Dispute Settlement Reform) with a broad mandate \nto work on the possible reform of investor-State dispute settlement and to develop \nrelevant solutions, \n \nBelieving that it would be desirable to develop a set of ethical standards for \nadjudicators responsible for resolving international investment disputes in the light \nof the concerns identified about the perceived or apparent lack of independence and \nimpartiality of some adjudicators, which often gave rise to criticism about the \nlegitimacy of the investor-State dispute settlement system,  \n \nConvinced that establishing and promulgating clear obligations on adjudicators \nwith regard to, among other things, independence and impartiality, limitation on \nmultiple roles, ex parte communication, confidentiality and disclosure, would be an \nappropriate response to the identified concerns, \n\nA/RES/78/105 \nCode of Conduct for Arbitrators in International Investment \nDispute Resolution and Code of Conduct for Judges in International \nInvestment Dispute Resolution with respective commentary of the \nUnited Nations Commission on International Trade Law\n \n23-24971\n2/2 \n \n \nAlso convinced that the development of uniform standards that would apply to \narbitrators involved in the resolution of international investment disputes would be \nhighly desirable, \n \nMindful that the Working Group is continuing to consider whether to \nrecommend a number of investor-State dispute settlement reform elements to the \nCommission, including the possible establishment of a standing mechanism to resolve \ninternational investment disputes and that a code of conduct for members of such a \nstanding mechanism (referred to as \u201cjudges\u201d) could form part of the rules governing \nthat mechanism, \n \nMindful also that the Working Group is considering the development of a \nmultilateral instrument to implement the investor-State dispute settlement reform \nelements, which could provide additional means to apply the Codes of Conduct,  \n \nNoting that the Commission adopted the Code of Conduct for Arbitrators in \nInternational Investment Dispute Resolution and accompanying commentary at its \nfifty-sixth session, and adopted, in principle, the Code of Conduct for Judges in \nInternational Investment Dispute Resolution and accompanying commentary at the \nsame session, both after due deliberations, \n \nNoting also that the preparation of the Code of Conduct for Arbitrators and the \nCode of Conduct for Judges, as well as their accompanying commentary, benefited \nfrom consultations with Governments and interested intergovernmental and \nnon-governmental organizations, and joint work of the secretariats of the \nInternational Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes and the Commission, \n \n1. \nExpresses its appreciation to the United Nations Commission on \nInternational Trade Law for having formulated and adopted the Code of Conduct for \nArbitrators in International Investment Dispute Resolution, the text of which is \ncontained in annex III to the report of the Commission on the work of its fifty-sixth \nsession,1 and for having formulated and adopted, in principle, the Code of Conduct \nfor Judges in International Investment Dispute Resolution, the text of which is \ncontained in annex IV to the same report;2 \n \n2. \nRecommends the use of the Code of Conduct for Arbitrators by arbitrators, \nformer arbitrators, candidates and disputing parties, as well as administering \ninstitutions, with regard to international investment disputes;
