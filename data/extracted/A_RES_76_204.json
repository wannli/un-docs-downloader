of a global response based on unity, \nsolidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one \nbehind,  \n \nRecognizing that it is urgent and critical to anticipate, plan for and reduce \ndisaster risk, expressing deep concern at the devastating impacts of COVID-19 on \nsustainable development, which have deepened vulnerabilities to disasters and \nexposure to hazards and have highlighted the urgency of implementing the Sendai \nFramework as an integral part of the 2030 Agenda, and noting in this regard that \nrecovery from the COVID-19 pandemic will provide opportunities for and should be \naccompanied by policies and focused action to understand disaster risk, strengthen \ndisaster risk governance to manage disaster risk, invest in disaster risk reduction for \nresilience and enhance disaster preparedness for effective response and to build back \nbetter in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction, as well as to address the \nunderlying

developing countries, in particular the least \ndeveloped countries, small island developing States, landlocked developing countries \nand African countries, as well as middle-income countries facing specific challenges, \nwarrant particular attention in view of their higher vulnerability and risk levels, which \noften greatly exceed their capacity to prepare for, respond to and recover from \ndisasters, and recognizing also that similar attention and appropriate assistance should \nalso be extended to other disaster-prone countries with specific characteristics, such \nas archipelagic countries, as well as countries with extensive coastlines,  \n \nRecalling that the Sendai Framework applies to risks of small-scale and large-\nscale, frequent and infrequent, sudden- and slow-onset disasters caused by natural or \nhuman-made hazards, as well as related environmental, technological and biological \nhazards and risks,  \n \nReiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind,

\nUrges the effective implementation of the Sendai Declaration and the \nSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030;  \n \n3. \nReiterates its call for the prevention of new and the reduction of existing \ndisaster risk through the implementation of integrated and inclusive economic, \nstructural, legal, social, health, cultural, educational, environmental, technological, \npolitical, financial and institutional measures that prevent and reduce hazard exposure \nand vulnerability to disaster, increase preparedness for response and recovery and \nthus strengthen resilience;  \n \n4. \nStresses the urgent need to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen \nresilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change and extreme weather events, and \nin this regard urges

Action Partnership and the Climate Risk and Early Warning \nSystems (CREWS) initiative, and also recalls the Year of Action launched by the \nGlobal Commission on Adaptation that culminated in the 2021 Climate Adaptation \nSummit;  \n \n7. \nRecognizes that in some cases the use of public debt and renewed external \nborrowing to absorb the impact of a disaster could lead to higher debt servicing for \ndeveloping countries and constrain their growth and their capacity to invest in long-\nterm resilience-building, and acknowledges that, with each new disaster, financial \nvulnerabilities may grow and domestic response capacities may weaken; \n__________________ \n \n13  A/76/240. \n\nA/RES/76/204 \nDisaster risk reduction\n \n21-19253\n6/12 \n \n \n8. \nCalls upon

Acknowledges that water is essential to the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, that water-related disasters and multidimensional hazards \nthreaten lives, livelihoods, agriculture and basic service infrastructure and cause \nsubstantial socioeconomic damage and losses, and that sustainable, integrated disaster \nrisk-informed water resource management is necessary for successful disaster \npreparedness, disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, and in this regard \ninvites all countries to integrate land and water management, including for floods and \ndroughts, into their national and subnational planning and management processes;  \n \n18. Recognizes that biological hazards require strengthened coordination \nbetween disaster and health risk management systems in the areas of risk assessment, \nsurveillance and early warning, and that resilient health infrastructures and \nstrengthened health systems capable of implementing the International Health \nRegulations (2005),14 as well as increasing the overall capacity of health systems, \nreduce overall disaster risk and build disaster resilience;  \n \n19. Urges States, while implementing the Sendai Framework, to prioritize the \nestablishment and strengthening of national disaster loss databases to augment efforts \nto create or enhance systems for data collection and the development of baselines on \ncurrent losses, including livelihood and other losses of affected populations, and work \ntowards the collection of information disaggregated by income, sex, age and disability \nand on historical disaster losses going back, at least, to 2005, if feasible;  \n \n20. Recognizes that disaster risk reduction requires a multi-hazard and \nsystemic approach and inclusive risk-informed decision-making based on the open \nexchange and dissemination of data disaggregated by, inter alia, income, sex, age and \ndisability, and analysis with an adequate understanding of how the information is to \nbe interpreted and used, as well as on easily accessible, up-to-date, comprehensible, \ninteroperable, science-based, non-sensitive risk information, for a wide range of users \nand decision makers, complemented by traditional knowledge, and in this regard \nencourages States to commence or, as appropriate, further enhance the collection and \nanalysis of data on disaster loss and other relevant disaster risk reduction targets, \ndisaggregated by income, sex, age and disability and other characteristics relevant in \nnational contexts, and to strengthen inter-institutional, inclusive coordination on \ndisaster risk data and integrated analysis, and invites Member States to mobilize \nnational statistical and planning offices and other relevant authorities, and strengthen \ntheir capacity in the systemic collection, analysis and validation of disaster risk data \n__________________ \n \n14  World Health Organization, document WHA58/2005/REC/1, resolution 58.3, annex. \n\nA/RES/76/204 \nDisaster risk reduction\n \n21-19253\n8/12 \n \nto institutionalize its use in decision-making processes and investments across \nsectors;  \n \n21.
