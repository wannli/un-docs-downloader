Countering the threat posed by improvised explosive devices \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecalling its resolutions 70/46 of 7 December 2015 and 71/72 of 5 December 2016,  \n \nExpressing grave concern over the devastation caused by the increasing use of \nimprovised explosive devices by illegal armed groups, terrorists and other \nunauthorized recipients,1 which has affected a large number of countries and has \nresulted in thousands of casualties, both civilian and military, and, in this regard, \nstressing the need for all actors to comply with applicable international law at all \ntimes, \n \nExpressing profound concern at the indiscriminate use and effects of \nimprovised explosive devices and at the increasing humanitarian impact of such \nattacks on civilian populations worldwide, in particular through the perpetration of \nterrorist acts, and noting the need for a comprehensive approach in addressing this \nconcern, \n \nExpressing concern at the serious harm that such improvised explosive device \nattacks have caused to United Nations staff and peacekeepers, and to humanitarian \nworkers, by threatening their lives, increasing the cost of their activities, limiting \ntheir freedom of movement and affecting their ability to effectively deliver on their \nmandates, \n \nExpressing concern also about the negative impact of these attacks on \nsocioeconomic development, infrastructure and freedom of movement, and on the \nsecurity and stability of States, and thus underlining the need to address this issue in \norder to achieve relevant goals and targets under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment,2 in particular target 16.1 on significantly reducing all forms of \nviolence and related death rates everywhere,  \n__________________ \n \n1 See resolution 69/51, A/CONF.192/BMS/2014/2, A/71/187 and Security Council resolution \n2370 (2017).  \n \n2 Resolution 70/1.  \n\nA/RES/72/36 \nCountering the threat posed by improvised explosive devices\n \n17-21711 \n2/7 \n \n \nUrging Member States to ensure that any measures taken or means employed \nto implement the present resolution comply with international law, in particular the \nCharter of the United Nations, applicable international humanitarian law and human \nrights law, \n \nRecognizing the importance of full involvement and equal opportunities for \nparticipation for both women and men in countering the threat posed by improvised \nexplosive devices, \n \nRecognizing also that the wide spectrum of materials that can be used for the \nmanufacture of improvised explosive devices, including those sourced from the \nmilitary and civilian industry, contributes to their diverse nature and their \ndeployment methods, which thus requires an appropriate approach to the \nformulation of measures to counter them,  \n \nNoting that the impact of improvised explosive devices spans a wide array of \npolicy areas and that, owing to the extent of the cross-cutting nature of the issue, a \nwhole-of-government approach focusing on the capacity of Governments to \neffectively bring together several policy strands for comprehensive action is \nessential,  \n \nUnderlining the important role that States can play in raising awareness among \nprivate sector and other entities about the possible theft, diversion and misuse of \ntheir products to make improvised explosive devices, with a view to enabling those \nentities to develop effective strategies to counter the threat of improvised explosive \ndevices,3 including to prevent the adverse impact of the diversion of materials and \nthe potential loss of revenue and risk to reputation, either in a partnership with \ngovernmental authorities, or through business-to-business processes or activities,  \n \nNoting existing industry-led initiatives that seek to increase industry oversight \nand accountability along the supply chain for precursor components, and \nencouraging States to engage, as appropriate, with private sector industry actors in \nsupporting such initiatives, \n \nNoting also the contribution of good governance, the promotion of human \nrights, the rule of law, adherence to the principles of the Charter and sustained and \ninclusive socioeconomic growth, including through effective measures and \nmechanisms for persons belonging to vulnerable groups, as important elements in \ncomprehensively addressing the issue of improvised explosive devices, in particular \nin post-conflict situations,  \n \nStressing the paramount need to prevent illegal armed groups, terrorists and \nother unauthorized recipients from, and identify the networks that support them in, \nobtaining, handling, financing, storing, using or seeking access to all types of \nexplosives, whether military or civilian, as well as other military or civilian \nmaterials and components that can be used to manufacture improvised explosive \ndevices, including detonators, detonating cords and chemical components, while at \nthe same time avoiding any undue restrictions on the legitimate use of those \nmaterials,  \n \nRecalling, in this context, relevant resolutions on the prevention of the \nacquisition of weapons by terrorists, including improvised explosive device \ncomponents, and their transfer to and between terrorists, associated groups and \nother illegal armed groups and criminals,4 \n__________________ \n \n3 See the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United
