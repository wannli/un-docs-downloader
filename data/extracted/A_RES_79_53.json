increasing use of \nimprovised explosive devices by illegal armed groups, terrorists and other \nunauthorized recipients, 1 which has affected a large number of countries and has \nresulted in thousands of casualties, both civilian and military, and in this regard \nstressing the need for all actors to comply with applicable international law at all times, \n \nExpressing concern over the increased use of and sophistication of the design \nand means of detonation of improvised explosive devices, including new trends and \nthe use of new technological advancements by illegal armed groups to design, \nmanufacture and deliver improvised explosive devices,2 \n \nExpressing profound concern at the indiscriminate use and effects of improvised \nexplosive devices and at the increasing humanitarian impact of such attacks on \ncivilian populations worldwide, in particular through the perpetration of terrorist acts, \nand noting the need for a comprehensive approach in addressing this concern, \n \nExpressing concern at the serious harm that such improvised explosive device \nattacks have caused to United Nations staff and peacekeepers, and to humanitarian \nworkers, by threatening their lives, increasing the cost of their activities, limiting their \nfreedom of movement and affecting their ability to effectively deliver on their mandates,

\nrights, the rule of law, adherence to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations \nand sustained and inclusive socioeconomic growth as important elements in \ncomprehensively addressing the issue of improvised explosive devices, in particular \nin post-conflict situations, \n \nRecognizing that the wide spectrum of materials that can be used for the \nmanufacture of improvised explosive devices, including those sourced from the \nmilitary and civilian industry, contributes to their diverse nature and their deployment \nmethods, which thus requires an appropriate approach to the formulation of measures \nto counter them, \n \nStressing the importance of effectively securing conventional ammunition \nstockpiles in order to mitigate the risk of their diversion to illicit use, inter alia, as \nmaterials for improvised explosive devices, and noting the voluntary, practical \nInternational Ammunition Technical Guidelines in this regard, \n \nUnderlining the important role that States can play in raising awareness among \nprivate sector and other entities about the possible theft, diversion and misuse of their \nproducts to manufacture improvised explosive devices, with a view to enabling those \nentities to develop effective measures to contribute to countering the threat of \nimprovised explosive devices, 4  including to prevent the adverse impact of the \ndiversion of materials and the potential loss of revenue and risk to reputation, either \nin a partnership with governmental authorities, or through business-to-business \nprocesses or activities, \n \nNoting existing industry-led initiatives that seek to increase industry oversight \nand accountability along the supply chain for precursor components, and encouraging \nStates to engage, as appropriate, with private sector industry actors in supporting such \ninitiatives, \n \nStressing the paramount need to prevent illegal armed groups, terrorists and \nother unauthorized recipients from handling, financing, storing, using or seeking \naccess to all types of explosives, whether military or civilian, as well as other military \nor civilian materials and components that can be used to manufacture improvised \nexplosive devices, including detonators, detonating cords and chemical components, \n__________________ \n \n3  Resolution 70/1. \n \n4  See the Guiding Principles on

security and counter-terrorism, while \nnoting that these do not fully and comprehensively address the use of improvised \nexplosive devices, and therefore stressing the importance of international cooperation \namong Member States in a comprehensive and coordinated approach to counter the \nglobal threat posed by improvised explosive devices in the hands of illegal armed \ngroups, terrorists and other unauthorized recipients, taking into account disparities in \nnational capacities, \n \nRecalling relevant resolutions on the prevention of the acquisition of weapons by \nterrorists,
