in a balanced and integrated manner, and to \nbuilding upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking \nto address their unfinished business, \n \nWelcoming and reaffirming the

domestic work by promoting the equal sharing of responsibilities between \nwomen and men within the household and by prioritizing, inter alia, sustainable \ninfrastructure, social protection policies
