  "text": "United Nations \nA/C.1/80/L.56\n \n \nGeneral Assembly \nDistr.: Limited \n16 October 2025 \nOriginal: English \n \n25-16793 (E)    271025 \n*2516793* \n \n \nEightieth session \nFirst Committee \nAgenda item 99 \nGeneral and complete disarmament \n \n \n \n \n \nAustria, El Salvador, Kazakhstan, Kiribati, Malta and Mexico: draft resolution \n \n \n \n Possible risks of the integration of artificial intelligence into \ncommand, control and communications systems of nuclear weapons  \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nReaffirming that nuclear disarmament and the total elimination of nuclear \nweapons are the only absolute guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear \nweapons, \n \nRecalling paragraph 58 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of \nthe General Assembly,1 in which it is stated that all States should consider as soon as \npossible various proposals designed to secure the avoidance of the use of nuclear \nweapons, the prevention of nuclear war and related objectives, where possible through \ninternational agreement, and thereby ensure that the survival of humankind is not \nendangered, \n \nAcknowledging that, pending the total elimination of nuclear weapons, there is \nan urgent need for further effective, concrete and transparent measures to reduce the \nrisk of use of nuclear weapons, and to contribute to the prevention of nuclear war, \nand affirming that nuclear risk reduction measures are not a substitute for nuclear \ndisarmament, \n \nMindful that States have started to increasingly integrate artificial intelligence \ninto a broad array of applications in the military domain, including into weapons, \nweapon systems, and other means and methods of warfare, as well as systems that \nsupport military operations, and in this regard taking note of resolution 79/239 of \n24 December 2024, \n \nConcerned about the possibility that artificial intelligence-driven decision-\nmaking related to command, control and communications systems of nuclear weapons \ncould reduce human control and oversight, increasing the possibility of induced \ndistortions in decision-making environments and shortened action and response \nwindows, particularly when related to the most sensitive and critical stages such as \ndecision to launch, which could heighten the risk of accidental, unintended or \nunauthorized use of nuclear weapons, \n__________________ \n \n1  Resolution S-10/2. \n\nA/C.1/80/L.56 \n \n25-16793\n2/2 \n \n \nConcerned also that inherent technical limitations of artificial intelligence \nsystems, including but not limited to the potential for malfunction, exploitation or \nintrusion, and cognitive and automation biases impacting training data and \nalgorithmic design, could produce hallucinations and flawed, inaccurate or \nmisleading outputs and understandings, which in turn could have serious and \ncatastrophic outcomes such as the accidental, unintended or unauthorized use of \nnuclear weapons, \n \nTaking note of the affirmation made by China and the United States of America, \non 16 November 2024, to \u201cmaintain human control over the decision to use nuclear \nweapons\u201d in the context of the development of artificial intelligence technology in \nthe military field, and urging other similar explicit declarations, \n \nTaking note also of the affirmation made by France and the United Kingdom of \nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland of their long-standing policy in this regard, to \n\u201cmaintain human control and involvement for all actions critical to informing and \nexecuting sovereign decisions\u201d, \n \nTaking into account potential opportunities for artificial intelligence to be \nfurther developed to enhance verification, irreversibility, transparency and \naccountability for nuclear disarmament, which should be fully explored and relevant \nresearch, innovation and development be promoted in this regard, and bearing in mind \nthat the development of artificial intelligence applications related to nuclear weapons \nshould also contribute to risk reduction in support of nuclear disarmament, \n \n1.  \nDemands that, pending the total elimination of nuclear weapons, human \ncontrol and oversight is maintained over command, control and communications \nsystems of nuclear weapons, including those that integrate artificial intelligence \ntechnology; \n \n2.  \nPending the total elimination of nuclear weapons, urges those nuclear-\nweapon States that have not yet done so, to adopt and publish national policies and \ndoctrines explicitly affirming and operationalizing that command, control and \ncommunications systems of nuclear weapons that integrate artificial intelligence will \nremain subject to human control and oversight and that such systems will not \nautonomously initiate decisions on the use of nuclear weapons, and, without prejudice \nto national security, to voluntarily inform relevant forums about these measures and \nimplementation mechanisms; \n \n3.  \nStresses the urgent need to address and develop, within the respective \nmandates of the disarmament machinery, meetings of parties to relevant treaties and \nother related multilateral and regional forums, common understandings, confidence-\nbuilding measures and other appropriate measures to ensure that, pending the total \nelimination of nuclear weapons, human control and oversight is maintained over \ncommand, control and communications systems of nuclear weapons; \n \n4.  \nDecides to include in the provisional agenda of its eighty-first session, \nunder the item entitled \u201cGeneral and complete disarmament\u201d, a sub-item entitled \n\u201cPossible risks of the integration of artificial intelligence into command, control and \ncommunications systems of nuclear weapons\u201d. \n \n \n",
