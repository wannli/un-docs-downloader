the workforce in self-\nemployment and part-time or temporary work and continue to bear most of the \nresponsibility for unpaid care work, having, as a result, lower rates of labour force \nparticipation and shorter formal working careers, which limits their ability to \ncontribute to social security entitlements, and noting in this regard that mechanisms \nto build social protection
