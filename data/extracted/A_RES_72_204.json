situations, in \nparticular African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing \ncountries and small island developing States, as well as some middle-income \ncountries, face challenges in servicing their debt and that, in spite of international \nefforts, a growing number of developing countries continue to struggle with high \ndebt burdens and are classified, in

responsibility of creditors and debtor countries to avoid \na build-up of unsustainable debt so as to reduce the risk of relapsing into another \ndebt crisis, taking into account the challenges posed

\n17-23268 \n4/7 \n \nWorld Bank, stresses the need for improved data collection and quality in areas that \ninclude domestic public debt, domestic and external private debt, as well as legal \nand

Notes with concern that some low- and middle-income developing \ncountries that were not part of the existing debt relief initiatives now have large debt \nburdens that may create constraints on mobilizing the resources needed to achieve \nthe Sustainable Development Goals, indicating a need to consider, as appropriate, \nstronger debt management initiatives for those countries, and stresses the \nimportance of medium- and long-term debt sustainability to deal with bilateral and \nnon-Paris Club debt; \n \n13. Underlines the fact that heavily indebted poor countries eligible for debt \nrelief will not be able to enjoy the full benefits unless all creditors, both public and \nprivate, contribute to debt workouts, as appropriate, in order to ensure the debt \nsustainability of those countries, and invites creditors, both private and public, that \nare not yet fully participating in debt relief initiatives to substantially increase their \nparticipation, including through providing comparable treatment, to the extent \npossible, to debtor countries that have concluded sustainable debt relief agreements \nwith creditors; \n\nExternal debt sustainability and development \nA/RES/72/204\n \n5/7 \n17-23268 \n \n \n14.
