Recognizes that the Addis Ababa Action Agenda provides a global \nframework for financing sustainable development and is an integral part of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development, supports and complements it and helps to \ncontextualize its means of implementation targets with concrete policies and actions, \nwhich relate to domestic public resources, domestic and international private business \nand finance, international development cooperation, international trade as an engine \nfor development, debt and debt sustainability, addressing systemic issues and science, \ntechnology, innovation and capacity-building, and data, monitoring and follow-up, \nand that its full implementation will be critical to effectively implement the Third \nDecade; \n \n29.

Further recognizes that private business activity, entrepreneurship, \ninvestment and innovation are major drivers of productivity, inclusive economic \ngrowth and job creation and that private international capital flows, particularly \nforeign direct investment, along with a stable international financial system, are vital \ncomplements to national development efforts; \n \n31. Recognizes that more can be done to create competitive business and \ninvestment climates in support of sustainable development that are well placed to \nattract private sector investment and participation, and encourages an increase in the \nvolume, quality, in particular its alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals, \ndiversification and long-term nature of foreign direct investment to all developing \ncountries; \n \n32.

Notes that an important use of international public finance, including \nODA, is to catalyse additional resource mobilization from other sources, public and \nprivate, and through appropriately designed risk-sharing instruments, including \nco-investments, public-private partnerships and guarantees, and also notes that it can \nsupport improved tax collection, help to strengthen domestic enabling environments \nand build essential public services and can also be used to unlock additional finance \nthrough blended or pooled financing and risk mitigation, notably for infrastructure \nand other investments that support private sector development; \n \n34. Emphasizes that international public finance plays an important role in \ncomplementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically, \n\nA/RES/73/246 \nImplementation of the Third United Nations Decade\nfor the Eradication of Poverty (2018\u20132027)\n \n18-22624\n12/14 \n \nespecially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited domestic \nresources; \n \n35.

Expresses concern that in 2017 ODA fell by 0.6 per cent compared with \n2016, while bilateral (country-to-country) aid to least developed countries rose by \n4 per cent, after remaining flat for the previous six years, and that ODA was, on \naverage, 0.31 per cent of the aggregate donor gross national income in 2014, below \nthe commitment of 0.7 per cent, reiterates that the fulfilment of all ODA \ncommitments remains crucial and that, for many least developed countries and \nlandlocked developing countries, ODA remains the largest source of external \nfinancing, and therefore emphasizes the importance of the commitments made by \nmany countries to achieve the national target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income \nand 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance \nto the least developed countries, and calls upon developed countries to deliver on their \ncommitments in relation to ODA; \n \n37. Welcomes the increasing efforts to improve the quality of ODA and to \nincrease its development impact, recognizes the Development Cooperation Forum of \nthe Economic and Social Council, notes other initiatives, such as the high-level \nforums on aid effectiveness, which produced, inter alia, the Paris Declaration on Aid \nEffectiveness, the Accra Agenda for Action25 and the Busan Partnership for Effective \nDevelopment Cooperation, which make important contributions to the efforts of the \ncountries that have made commitments to them, including through the adoption of \ntheir fundamental principles, and bears in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all \nformula that will guarantee effective assistance and that the specific situation of each \ncountry needs to be fully considered; \n \n38. Encourages all relevant stakeholders, as appropriate, to strengthen United \nNations funding for the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, \nincluding extreme poverty, through voluntary contributions to existing poverty-\nrelated system-wide funds; \n \n39. Acknowledges the complexity of the challenge of poverty eradication, and \nin this regard emphasizes that, in accelerating poverty eradication and effectively \nimplementing the Third Decade, the organizations of the United Nations development \nsystem must be driven by national priorities, including through the United Nations \nDevelopment Assistance Framework, with the development of national capacities and \ndevelopment strategies in developing countries continuing to be a core area of focus, \nand operate in an integrated, coordinated and coherent manner, through development \nprogrammes and projects that address poverty eradication as their underlying \nobjective, within their respective mandates, in order to ensure that gains are \nirreversible, making full use of the interlinked and mutually reinforcing pillars of the \nUnited Nations development system, and encourages the use of diverse strategies; \n \n40.
