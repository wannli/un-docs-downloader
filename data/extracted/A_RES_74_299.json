Improving global road safety \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecalling its resolutions 57/309 of 22 May 2003, 58/9 of 5 November 2003, \n58/289 of 14 April 2004, 60/5 of 26 October 2005, 62/244

considered the note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report on \nimproving global road safety1 and the recommendations contained therein,  \n \nReaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled \u201cTransforming \nour world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d, in which it adopted a \ncomprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative \nSustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for \nthe full implementation of the Agenda by 2030 ensuring that no one is left behind, its \nrecognition that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including \nextreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement \nfor sustainable development, its commitment to achieving sustainable development \nin its three dimensions \u2013 economic, social and environmental \u2013 in a balanced and \nintegrated manner, and to building upon the achievements of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and seeking to address their unfinished business,  \n \nRecalling that the Sustainable Development Goals and targets are integrated and \nindivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development, and \nacknowledging the importance of reaching the road safety-related targets of the 2030 \nAgenda,  \n__________________ \n \n1  A/74/304 and A/74/304/Corr.1. \n\nA/RES/74/299 \nImproving global road safety\n \n20-11345\n2/9 \n \n \nRecalling also the New Urban Agenda adopted at the United Nations \nConference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), 2 which, \ntaking into account that the majority of road traffic deaths and serious injuries take \nplace in urban areas, gives appropriate consideration to road safety and access to safe, \naffordable, accessible and sustainable public transport and non-motorized modes of \ntransport,  \n \nNoting that the overwhelming majority of road traffic deaths and serious injuries \nare preventable and that, despite some improvements in many countries, including in \ndeveloping countries, they remain a major public health and development problem \nthat has broad social and economic consequences which, if unaddressed, may affect \nprogress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,  \n \nRecognizing that human suffering, combined with costs to some countries of up \nto 5 per cent of their gross domestic product a year, makes reducing road traffic deaths \nand injuries both an economic and a social priority, especially for some countries, and \nthat investment in road safety has a positive impact on public health and the economy,  \n \nTaking into account that road traffic deaths and injuries are also a social equity \nissue, as the poor and the vulnerable are most frequently also vulnerable road users, \nnamely, pedestrians, cyclists, users of motorized two- and three-wheeled vehicles and \npassengers of unsafe public transport, who are disproportionately affected and \nexposed to risks and road traffic crashes, which can lead to a cycle of poverty \nexacerbated by income loss, and recalling that the aim of road safety policies should \nbe to guarantee protection to all users,  \n \nRecognizing that road safety requires addressing broader issues of equitable \naccess to mobility and that the promotion of sustainable modes of transport, in \nparticular safe public transport and safe walking and cycling, is a key element of road \nsafety,  \n \nTaking into account the importance of strengthening institutional capacity and \ncontinuing international cooperation, including South-South and triangular \ncooperation, cooperation between countries that share roads across borders and \ncooperation among regional and international organizations, to further support efforts \nto improve road safety worldwide, particularly in developing countries, and \nproviding, as appropriate, support to meet the goals of the Decade of Action for Road \nSafety 2011\u20132020 and those of the 2030 Agenda,  \n \nEmphasizing that, while each country has primary responsibility for its own \neconomic and social development and the role of national policies, priorities and \ndevelopment strategies cannot be overemphasized in the context of reaching the \nSustainable Development Goals, international public finance plays an important role \nin complementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically, \nespecially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited domestic \nresources,  \n \nExpressing its concern that the number of road traffic crashes remains \nunacceptably high, and that crashes represent a leading cause of death and injury \naround the world, killing more than 1.35 million people and injuring as many as 50 \nmillion people a year, with 90 per cent of those casualties occurring in developing \ncountries, and concerned also that road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death \naround the world for children and young people between 15 and 29 years of age,  \n \nExpressing its concern also that target 3.6 of Sustainable Development Goal 3 \nwill not be met by 2020, and noting that significant progress can be achieved through \nstronger national leadership, global cooperation, implementation of evidence-based \n__________________ \n \n2  Resolution 71/256, annex. \n\nImproving global road safety \nA/RES/74/299\n \n3/9\n20-11345 \n \nstrategies and engagement with all relevant actors, including the private sector, as \nwell as additional innovative approaches,  \n \nExpressing its concern further that the adoption and implementation of road \nsafety measures remain inadequate in many countries,  \n \nAcknowledging the leading role of Oman and the Russian Federation in drawing \nthe attention of the international community to the global road safety crisis,  \n \nCommending Member States that have taken a leadership role by adopting \ncomprehensive legislation on key risk factors, including the non-use of seat belts, \nchild restraints and helmets, the drinking of alcohol and driving, and speeding, and \ndrawing

substances, mobile phones and other electronic and \ntexting devices,  \n \nEncouraging Member States to promote multi-stakeholder partnerships to \naddress the safety of vulnerable road users, the delivery of first aid to victims of road \ntraffic accidents or crashes, training and education, notably in developing and least \ndeveloped countries,  \n \nRecognizing the progress made by some Member States in providing road traffic \ncrash victims and their families with universal access to health care in the \npre-hospital, hospital, post-hospital and rehabilitation and reintegration phases,  \n \nAcknowledging the work of the United Nations system, in particular the \nleadership of the World Health Organization, in close cooperation with the United \nNations regional commissions,

\nefforts as well as that of the World Bank and regional development banks to \nimplementing road safety projects and programmes, in particular in developing \ncountries,  \n \nAcknowledging also the lessons learned from the Decade of Action for Road \nSafety 2011\u20132020, such as the need to promote an integrated approach to road safety \nsuch as a safe system approach and Vision Zero, pursue long-term and sustainable \nsafety solutions, and strengthen national intersectoral collaboration, including \nengagement with non-governmental organizations and civil society and academia, as \nwell as businesses and industry, which contribute to and influence the social and \neconomic development of countries,  \n \nCommending the World Health Organization for its leadership role in preventing \nroad traffic injury and for its role in implementing the mandate conferred upon it by \nthe General Assembly to act, in close cooperation with the United Nations regional \ncommissions, as a coordinator on road safety issues within the United Nations \nsystem,3 \n \nCommending the United Nations regional commissions for their work in \nincreasing road safety activities and advocating
