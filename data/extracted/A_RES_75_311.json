Tackling illicit trafficking in wildlife \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nReaffirming its resolutions 69/314 of 30 July 2015, 70/301 of 9 September 2016, \n71/326 of 11 September 2017 and 73/343 of 16 September 2019 on tackling illicit \ntrafficking in wildlife, \n \nReaffirming also its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled \n\u201cTransforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d, by which \nit adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and \ntransformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, \n \nReaffirming further the intrinsic value of biological diversity and its various \ncontributions to sustainable development and human well-being, and recognizing that \nwild fauna and flora in their many beautiful and varied forms are an irreplaceable part \nof the natural systems of the Earth which must be protected for this generation and \nthe generations to come, \n \nSeriously concerned about the rate of species extinctions, as indicated in the \nfindings of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and \nEcosystem Services, and stressing the urgent need to address the unprecedented \nglobal decline in biodiversity, including by preventing the extinction of threatened \nspecies, to improve and sustain their conservation status and to restore and safeguard \necosystems that provide essential functions and services, including services related \nto water, health, livelihoods and well-being, \n \nRemaining concerned, therefore, about the increasing scale of poaching and \nillegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products and its adverse economic, social and \nenvironmental impacts, \n\nA/RES/75/311 \nTackling illicit trafficking in wildlife\n \n21-10242\n2/11 \n \n \nExpressing serious concern over the extraordinarily detrimental levels of \nrhinoceros poaching, the alarmingly high levels of killings of elephants in Africa and \nthe significant increase in illicit pangolin trafficking, as well as the illegal trade in \nother protected wildlife species, including but not limited to tortoises, marine and \nfreshwater turtles, land and marine iguanas, other reptiles, sharks, ornamental fish, \ngreat apes, parrots, raptors, the helmeted hornbill and big cats, including the snow \nleopard, which threaten those species with local extinction and, in some cases, with \nglobal extinction, \n \nNoting with concern that, in addition to long-established illicit markets, new \nillicit markets are constantly emerging and pushing other species into the endangered \ncategory, such as the European eel or, owing to the illegal pet trade, the Philippine \nforest turtle and the pancake tortoise,  \n \nNoting that, since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), some \ncountries have reported a decline in seizures of illicitly trafficked wildlife, likely due \nto lockdowns, economic slowdown and restricted human and goods transport, while \nalso noting reports indicating a corresponding increase in stockpiling of illicit wildlife \nand its products in origin countries, \n \nRecognizing that rapid and profound socioecological changes, among other \nfactors, such as degradation and unsustainable use of ecosystems, loss of habitats, and \npoorly managed wildlife trade drive the risk of a large-scale species extinction and \nbiodiversity loss, threaten the vital contributions that nature makes to people and their \nlivelihoods and increase the likelihood of zoonotic diseases emerging and spreading \namong wildlife, livestock and domestic animals, which consequently increases the \nrisk of pathogens spreading from animals to humans, leading to zoonotic disease \noutbreaks, epidemics and, in extreme cases, pandemics, \n \nRecognizing also that illicit trafficking in live wild animals and bushmeat does \nnot adhere to sanitary regulations and avoids quarantine controls on import, and can \ntherefore increase the probability of novel infections among trafficked animals and \nrepresents an increased risk for transmitting zoonotic diseases, with the potential to \nnegatively impact human and animal health, \n \nDetermined to reduce the risks for future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, which \nmay lead to epidemics and, in extreme cases, pandemics and their devastating impact \non human health and livelihoods, and recognizing that curbing illicit wildlife \ntrafficking and conserving and restoring biodiversity and functioning ecosystems can \ncontribute to reducing the risk of emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases,  \n \nRecognizing that wildlife crime may contribute to disease outbreaks, epidemics \nand, in extreme cases, pandemics, which may be a threat not only to the environment \nand biodiversity, but also to human health and economic development, \n \nRecognizing also that human, animal, plant and ecosystem health are \ninterdependent, and therefore emphasizing that biodiversity and health linkages \nshould be addressed holistically, recalling in this regard decision 14/4 of \n30 November 2018 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological \nDiversity1 and resolution 3/4 of 30 January 2018 of the United Nations Environment \nAssembly,2 \n \nUnderlining the need to take measures to combat illegal harvesting of timber \nand associated trade, which leads to the decimation of rare timber species, in \nparticular of rosewood, agarwood and sandalwood, and noting the high volume of \n__________________ \n \n1 See United Nations Environment Programme, document CBD/COP/14/14, sect.

\nharvested timber from being laundered along global supply chains,  \n \nRecognizing that illicit trafficking in wildlife contributes to the extinction of \nmany species and damage to ecosystems and rural livelihoods, including those based \non ecotourism, undermines good governance and the rule of law and, in some cases, \nthreatens national stability and requires enhanced transnational and regional \ncooperation and coordination in response,  \n \nEmphasizing that the protection of wildlife must be part of a comprehensive \napproach to achieving poverty eradication, food security, sustainable development, \nincluding the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, economic \ngrowth, social well-being and sustainable livelihoods, \n \nEmphasizing also, in this regard, the need to develop context-specific solutions \nfor the sustainable and resilient coexistence of humans and wildlife, both within and \noutside protected areas, with the aim of contributing to the improvement of \nlivelihoods and to conservation efforts, \n \nRecalling its resolution 61/295 of 13 September 2007, entitled \u201cUnited Nations \nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\u201d, recognizing that respect for \nindigenous traditional practices contributes to sustainable and equitable development \nand proper management of the environment, and recognizing also the essential \nengagement role of indigenous peoples and local communities to ensure a sustainable \nsolution to addressing the illegal wildlife trade, \n \nReaffirming its call for holistic and integrated approaches to sustainable \ndevelopment that will guide humanity to live in harmony with nature and lead to \nefforts to restore the health and integrity of the Earth\u2019s ecosystem, which will \ncontribute to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and achievement of the \nSustainable Development Goals for the common future of present and coming \ngenerations, \n \nNoting with concern the increased use of online intermediaries, including social \nmedia platforms and online marketplaces, that facilitate the trafficking in wildlife and \nwildlife products, and recognizing the need to develop and utilize relevant techniques \nto counter illicit wildlife trafficking online, recognizing in this regard the need for \nenhanced technical and digital capacity-building, in particular for developing \ncountries, \n \nConcerned about the persistent use of forged or illegally issued permits and \ncertificates or the fraudulent use of authentic permits and certificates in order to \nmisuse domestic legal markets to mask trade in illegally obtained wildlife or wildlife \nproducts, or to launder such illegally obtained wildlife or wildlife products, and \nconcerned also about the facilitating role of corruption in this regard, \n \nRecognizing the legal framework provided by and the important role of the \nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 3 \nas the primary mechanism for regulating international trade in species of wild fauna \nand flora listed in its appendices, and in this regard welcoming the relevant \nresolutions and decisions adopted at the eighteenth meeting of the Conference of the \nParties to the Convention, held in Geneva from 17 to 28 August 2019, \n \nRecognizing also the importance of other multilateral environmental \nagreements, including the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of \n__________________ \n \n3 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 993, No. 14537.

2013 on \ncrime prevention and criminal justice responses to illicit trafficking in protected \nspecies of wild fauna and flora, in which the Council encouraged Member States to \nmake illicit trafficking in protected species of wild fauna and flora involving \norganized criminal groups a serious crime, \n \nNoting that wildlife trafficking is a lucrative form of transnational organized \ncrime and can be linked to other forms of transnational organized crime, and noting \nwith concern the role that corruption can play in facilitating illicit trafficking in \nwildlife and wildlife products, \n \nReaffirming that the United Nations Convention against Transnational \nOrganized Crime8 and the United Nations Convention against Corruption 9 constitute \neffective tools and an important part of the legal framework for international \ncooperation in fighting illicit trafficking in endangered species of wild fauna and \nflora, \n \nBearing in mind that the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and other \nforms of transnational organized crime could be linked to illicit trafficking in wildlife, \nwhich may pose a serious threat to national and regional stability in some parts of \nAfrica, \n \nRecognizing the important work of the International Consortium on Combating \nWildlife Crime, a collaborative effort of the secretariat of the Convention on \nInternational Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the International \nCriminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), the United Nations Office on Drugs and \nCrime, the World Bank and the
