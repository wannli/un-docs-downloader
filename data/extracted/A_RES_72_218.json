(e) of the Sendai Framework by 2020, the scale of action needed for the \ndevelopment of national and local disaster risk reduction strategies, and thus \nencourages States to continue to prioritize and support the development of inclusive \nnational and local disaster risk reduction strategies, promoting synergies with existing \nnational policies and plans, including national climate change adaptation plans, where \nrelevant, and to establish and strengthen national disaster loss databases, risk profiles \nand available capacities, as well as the conduct of risk assessments, and reaffirms the \nneed for the enhancement of the implementation capacity and capability of \ndeveloping countries, in particular the least developed countries, small island \ndeveloping States, landlocked developing countries and African countries, as well as \nmiddle-income countries facing specific challenges, including the mobilization of \nsupport through international cooperation, for the provision of means of \nimplementation to augment domestic efforts in accordance with their national \npriorities;  \n \n10.

Also recognizes that economic losses are rising as a result of the increasing \nnumber and value of assets exposed to hazards, and encourages countries to conduct \na disaster risk assessment of existing critical infrastructure, to make disaster risk \nassessments a prerequisite for infrastructure and housing investments and to \nstrengthen regulatory frameworks for land-use planning and building codes, as \nappropriate, towards achieving target (d) of the Sendai Framework, and in this regard \nencourages countries to integrate disaster risk reduction considerations into social, \neconomic and environmental investments;  \n \n13. Acknowledges that water is essential to the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals,14 and that water-related disasters and multidimensional hazards \nthreaten lives, livelihoods, agriculture and basic service infrastructure and cause \nsubstantial socioeconomic damage and losses, and that sustainable and integrated \nwater resource management is necessary for successful disaster preparedness, disaster \nrisk reduction and climate change adaptation, and in this regard invites all countries \nto integrate land and water management, including for floods and droughts, into their \nnational and subnational planning and management processes;  \n \n14. Emphasizes that preventing and reducing disaster risk provides \nexponential returns and significantly reduced costs associated with subsequent \nresponse, as well as the importance of additional efforts to increase the availability of \nand access to multi-hazard early warning mechanisms of States, in order to ensure \nthat early warning leads to early action, and encourages all relevant stakeholders to \nsupport these efforts;  \n \n15. Urges States, while implementing the Sendai Framework, to continue \nworking on data collection and the development of baselines on current losses, \nincluding working towards the collection of disaggregated information and historical \ndisaster losses going back, at least, to 2005, if feasible;  \n \n16. Encourages States to give appropriate consideration to disaster risk \nreduction in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \nwhere it is reflected across several Goals and targets, including in their voluntary \nnational reviews;  \n \n17.

Stresses the importance of mainstreaming a gender perspective and the \nperspectives of persons with disabilities in disaster risk management so as to \nstrengthen the resilience of communities and reduce social vulnerabilities to disasters, \nand in this regard recognizes the need for the inclusive participation and contribution \nof women, children, older persons, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and \nlocal communities, as well as the role of youth, volunteers, migrants, local \ncommunities, academia, scientific and research entities and networks, business, \nprofessional associations, private sector financing institutions and the media, in all \nforums and processes related to disaster risk reduction, in accordance with the Sendai \nFramework;  \n \n27. Recognizes that biological hazards require strengthened coordination \nbetween disaster and health risk management systems in the areas of risk assessment, \nsurveillance and early warning, and that resilient health infrastructures and \nstrengthened health systems capable of implementing the International Health \nRegulations (2005),20 as well as increasing the overall capacity of health systems, \nreduce overall disaster risk and build disaster resilience;  \n \n28. Expresses its appreciation to the Government of Mexico for hosting the \nfifth session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction in Cancun, Mexico, \nfrom 22 to 26 May 2017, acknowledges the Chair\u2019s summary and the Cancun high-\nlevel communiqu\u00e9, and reaffirms the importance of the Global Platform as a forum to \nassess and discuss progress on the Sendai Framework and advance coherence between \ndisaster risk reduction, sustainable development and climate change mitigation and \nadaptation;  \n \n29.
