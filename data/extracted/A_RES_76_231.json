Reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of \nresponsible behaviours \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecalling its resolutions 68/50 of 5 December 2013 and 75/35 of 7 December 2020, \n \nRecalling also its resolution 75/36 of 7 December 2020, in which it requested \nthe Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States on the further development \nand implementation of norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours and on \nthe reduction of the risks of misunderstanding and miscalculations with respect to \nouter space, and to submit a substantive report, with an annex containing these views, \nto the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, \n \nReaffirming the applicability of international law, including the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, to activities in outer space and the right of all States to explore and \nuse outer space without discrimination of any kind, on a basis of equality and in \naccordance with such law, and emphasizing the importance of full compliance with \nsuch law, \n \nReaffirming also the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in \nthe Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial \nBodies,1 and the obligations for States parties to the Treaty to explore and use outer \nspace for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, and to be guided by the \nprinciple of cooperation and mutual assistance, \n \nWelcoming the ongoing work by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer \nSpace on the implementation of the 21 Guidelines for the Long-term

behaviours\n \n21-19662\n2/4 \n \nof Outer Space Activities,2 which may have a positive effect on international peace \nand security, \n \nEmphasizing the need to maintain outer space as a peaceful, safe, stable, secure \nand sustainable environment for the benefit of all and the significant contribution of \nouter space activities to social, economic, scientific and technological development, \nas well as to international peace and security, \n \nUrging all States, when developing, planning and executing their space \nactivities, to remain committed to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space and \nto refrain from conducting activities contrary to their obligations under international \nlaw, including those that could threaten the ability of all States to freely use and \nexplore outer space, now and in the future, \n \nStressing that the creation of long-lived orbital debris arising from the deliberate \ndestruction of space systems increases the risk of in-orbit collisions and the potential \nfor misunderstanding and miscalculations that could lead to conflict, \n \nSeriously concerned about the possibility of an arms race in outer space, and \nreaffirming that the prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a grave \ndanger for international peace and security, as well as being an essential condition for \nthe promotion and strengthening of international cooperation in the exploration and \nuse of outer space for peaceful purposes, \n \nRecalling paragraph 80 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of \nthe General Assembly,3 in which it is stated that, in order to prevent an arms race in \nouter space, further measures should be taken and appropriate international \nnegotiations held in accordance with the spirit of the Treaty on Principles Governing \nthe Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon \nand Other Celestial Bodies, \n \nConvinced that possible solutions to outer space security can involve a \ncombination of legally binding obligations and political commitments, and that work \nin both of these areas can be further pursued in a progressive, sustained and \ncomplementary manner, without undermining existing legal obligations, \n \nRecalling the primary role of the Conference on Disarmament on questions \nrelating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space in all its aspects, including \nthe weaponization of outer space and threats from capabilities on Earth, and the \nrelevant responsibilities of the First Committee of the General Assembly and the \nDisarmament Commission, \n \nNoting the rapid advances of technologies in space systems, the use of which \ncould have positive or negative effects on international security, and encouraging \nfurther discussion among States of the impact of these developments, \n \nRecognizing that efforts to prevent an arms race and to prevent conflict from \nbeginning in or extending into outer space must include consideration of the use of \nall potential technologies and means, whether on Earth or in outer space, \n \nStressing that uses of these technologies and means for purposes inconsistent \nwith the objectives of maintaining international stability and security, including \nagainst signals for operators and users and the terrestrial infrastructure supporting \nspace systems, can lead to the perception of threats on Earth as well as in outer space \n__________________ \n \n2  Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-fourth Session, Supplement No. 20 (A/74/20), \nannex II.

and that such threats already \nexist in outer space and on Earth, \n \nRecognizing the need for States to seek to avoid and mitigate the potential \nimpact on peace and security arising from accidents, miscommunication or a lack of \ntransparency, which could lead to miscalculations and the escalation of tensions and \ncontribute to an arms race, \n \nReiterating the need for all States to work together to reduce threats to space \nsystems through the further development and implementation of norms, rules and \nprinciples of responsible behaviours with the aim of maintaining a peaceful, safe, \nstable, secure and sustainable outer space environment, which might, as appropriate \nand without prejudice, contribute to further consideration of legally binding \ninstruments on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, \n \nReaffirming that verification is one of the essential components of legally \nbinding arms control instruments, and encouraging further consideration of effective \nverification regarding space systems, \n \nRecognizing the importance of the full involvement and equal participation of \nwomen and men in discussions on reducing space threats through responsible \nbehaviours and the need to assess the possible differentiated impacts of such threats, \n \n1. \nAffirms that all States must conduct their activities in the exploration and \nuse of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, in conformity with \ninternational law, including the Charter of the United Nations, and urges Member \nStates to take this into account when formulating their space policies; \n \n2. \nEncourages those States that have not yet become parties to the \ninternational treaties governing the exploration and use of outer space
