Barbuda Agenda for Small \nIsland Developing States will enable small island developing States to make progress \ntowards these agendas,  \n \nReaffirming that small island developing States remain a special case for \nsustainable development due to their unique vulnerability to exogenous shocks owing \nto, inter alia, their small size, geographical remoteness, highly dispersed populations, \nthe limited scale and undiversified nature of their economies, high dependence on \nexternal markets, and extreme exposure to disasters and natural hazards and the \neffects of climate change, \n \nNoting

small island developing States have not \nachieved sustained high levels of economic growth, which has fallen from 4.5 per \ncent to approximately 2.3 per cent in 2023, and their external debt sustainability \ndeteriorated in 2023 as external debt service surged by over 50 per cent year over year \nand public and publicly guaranteed debt service rose by 33.4 per cent year over year, \nwith the ratio of total debt service to export revenues in small island developing States \nrising to 20.3 per cent in 2023 from 12.6 per cent in 2022, and with the liquidity buffer \nof reserves to short-term external debt continuing to decrease, to 133.1 per cent in \n2023 from 152.4 per cent in 2022, in stark contrast to the average from 2000 to 2023 \nof 200.7 per cent, making small island developing States particularly vulnerable to \nexternal financial shocks,  \n \nAcknowledging the need for urgent action to address the adverse impacts of \nclimate change, including those related to sea level rise and extreme weather events, \nwhich continue to pose a significant risk to small island developing States and to their \nefforts to achieve sustainable development and, for many, represent the gravest of \nthreats to their survival and viability, as well as through threats to water availability \nand food security and nutrition,  \n \nNoting the importance of oceans, seas and marine resources to small island \ndeveloping States, owing to their unique characteristics, dependence on and particular \nexposure to the ocean and its biodiversity, and noting also the central role of the ocean \nin the culture, livelihoods and sustainable development of the peoples of small island \ndeveloping States,  \n \nNoting with concern the uneven progress towards achieving sustainable
