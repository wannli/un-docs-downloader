We \nfurther reaffirm that gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls will \nmake a crucial contribution to the achievement of the Vienna Programme of Action. \n5. \nWe recognize the importance of unfettered, efficient and cost-effective access \nfor landlocked developing countries to and from the sea, on the basis of freedom of \ntransit and other related matters, in accordance with the applicable rules of \ninternational law. \n \n \n \nReview and assessment of progress, gaps and challenges \n \n6. \nWe take note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of \nthe Vienna Programme of Action7 and recognize the many efforts at all levels made \nby landlocked developing countries and transit countries, with the support of \ndevelopment partners, and the progress achieved since 2014, building on the Almaty \nProgramme of Action.8 At the same time, we remain concerned that the progress made \nis not enough for landlocked developing countries to achieve the Vienna Programme \nof Action targets and sustainable development. We note with concern that one third \nof the population of landlocked developing countries is still living in extreme poverty, \nthe prevalence of moderate to severe food insecurity persists, the average human \ndevelopment index of landlocked developing countries lags behind the world average \nand economic growth of landlocked developing countries has declined during the \nreview period.  \n7. \nWe commend those landlocked developing countries that have met the criteria \nfor graduation from least developed country status. \n8. \nWe recognize that a key challenge faced by landlocked developing countries is \nthe lack of reliable and regular data to inform policy and ensure follow-up, including \non some of the specific objectives of the Vienna Programme of Action.  \n__________________ \n \n2  Resolution 70/1. \n \n3  Resolution 69/313, annex. \n \n4  See FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21, annex. \n \n5  Resolution 69/283, annex II. \n \n6  Resolution 71/256, annex. \n \n7  A/74/113. \n \n8  Almaty Programme of Action: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing \nCountries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked \nand Transit Developing Countries (Report of the International Ministerial Conference of \nLandlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries and International Financial \nand Development Institutions on Transit Transport Cooperation, Almaty, Kazakhstan, 28 and \n29 August 2003 (A/CONF.202/3), annex I). \n\nPolitical Declaration of the High-level Midterm Review on the Implementation of the Vienna \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014\u20132024 \nA/RES/74/15\n \n3/9\n19-20986 \n \n9. \nWe recognize the progress that has been made by landlocked developing \ncountries and transit developing countries in ratifying the World Trade Organization \nAgreement on Trade Facilitation, the revised Kyoto Convention, 9  the TIR \nConvention10 and other relevant international conventions. We note, however, that \nthere is a need for landlocked developing countries and transit countries to effectively \nimplement their obligations under these conventions and agreements.  \n10. We welcome the recent developments among landlocked developing countries \nand their transit neighbours in building transit transport and economic corridors. \nProgress has been made in reducing travel time and corresponding costs along \ncorridors, significantly reducing the time spent at borders and at intermodal points.  \n11. \nProgress has been made in landlocked developing countries and transit \ndeveloping countries towards the expansion and upgrading of railways, roads, ports, \nair transport and inland waterways. Some missing links have been closed, and \nregional integration has been strengthened, but limited connectivity of landlocked \ndeveloping countries remains one of the main obstacles to their enhanced trade \nintegration.  \n12. We note that infrastructure in landlocked developing countries for the \nproduction, supply, transmission and distribution of modern and renewable energy \nservices has been expanded and upgraded. However, more than 40 per cent of the \npopulation of landlocked developing countries still does not have access to electricity, \nand the rural-urban gap remains significant. The pace of completion of power projects \nis too slow. \n13. We recognize that access to information and communications technologies in \nlandlocked developing countries has increased. However, we note that landlocked \ndeveloping countries continue to face major constraints that include infrastructural \ngaps and the relatively high cost of information and communications technology \nservices, in particular accessing submarine cables. \n14. The major challenges in infrastructure development include limited financial \nresources to close the significant infrastructure financing gaps, lack of capacity to \ndevelop bankable infrastructure projects, limited technologies and lack of resilient \ninfrastructure. \n15. We welcome efforts made by landlocked developing countries to enhance their \nparticipation in global trade, including through mainstreaming trade into their \nnational strategies and updating their trade-related policies. However, we note that \nlandlocked developing countries continue to face greater difficulties than coastal \ncountries in expanding international trade. The competitiveness of landlocked \ndeveloping countries remains limited owing to the high cost of trade, which is double \nthat of transit developing countries. In that regard, we note with concern that the share \nof landlocked developing countries in global trade has declined and their share of \nglobal merchandise exports has decreased, while the total value of merchandise \nimports has increased. \n16. We are concerned that most of the exports of landlocked developing countries \nremain highly concentrated on a few primary commodities and that service exports \nare still dominated by the tourism sector. The lack of diversification of exports of \nlandlocked developing countries exacerbates their vulnerability to excessive price \nvolatility and exogenous economic and environmental shocks. \n__________________ \n \n9  Protocol of Amendment to the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization \nof Customs Procedures (United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2370, No. 13561). \n \n10  Customs Convention on the International Transport of Goods under Cover of TIR Carnets \n(United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1079, No. 16510). \n\nA/RES/74/15 \nPolitical Declaration of the High-level Midterm Review on the Implementation of the Vienna \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014\u20132024\n \n19-20986\n4/9 \n \n17. We note the lack of availability of trade finance in landlocked developing \ncountries. We reaffirm that international trade is an engine for inclusive economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction and contributes to the promotion of sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n18. We note with concern the lack of access to capital for micro-, small and medium-\nsized enterprises, including women- and youth-owned enterprises, which affects \noverall private sector development and economic growth in landlocked developing \ncountries. We are further concerned that landlocked developing countries still fall \nbehind in their electronic commerce (e-commerce) readiness.  \n19. We recognize that the participation of landlocked developing countries in \nregional and subregional trade, transport and transit facilitation agreements and \ninitiatives aimed at deepening regional integration, enhancing infrastructure \nconnectivity and facilitating the movement of cargo across borders has increased. \nLandlocked developing countries have entered into bilateral and plurilateral trade, \ntransport and transit-related agreements with their neighbours. In this regard, we take \nnote of the entry into force of the agreement establishing the African Continental Free \nTrade Area.  \n20. We are encouraged by signs that broader cooperation in areas such as \ninvestment, research and development and policies supportive of regional industrial \ndevelopment and regional connectivity is taking place both among landlocked \ndeveloping countries and between landlocked developing countries and their \nneighbours. \n21. Since 2014, many landlocked developing countries have placed structural \neconomic transformation at the centre of their national development plans and \nadopted strategies for diversification and upgrading of their economies, \nindustrialization, export promotion and private sector development, but landlocked \ndeveloping countries have made limited advancement towards achieving structural \ntransformation, still have limited manufacturing and industrial capacity to create high \nvalue added products, some landlocked developing countries even showing signs of \nde-industrialization of their economies. \n22. We acknowledge the efforts by landlocked developing countries to support \nprivate sector development and emphasize that an enabling legal and regulatory \nenvironment for the local private sector is one of the most important requirements for \npromoting sustainable, inclusive and sustained economic growth, developing an \nindustrial base, attracting investment and bringing about structural transformation. \n23. We express concern at the limited technological capabilities, low technology \nintensity and acquisition and low investments in research and development in \nlandlocked developing countries. \n24. Landlocked developing countries are highly vulnerable to the adverse impact of \nclimate change and remain heavily affected by desertification, land degradation, \nbiodiversity loss, drought and receding glaciers. We are concerned about the \neconomic, social and environmental impacts of sudden- and slow-onset disasters in \nlandlocked developing countries, as well as the impacts of disasters in transit \ncountries on the economies of landlocked developing countries. \n25. We note that lack of adequate financial resources and capacity constraints are \nsome of the biggest challenges that landlocked developing countries face in their \nefforts to implement the Vienna Programme of Action and achieve sustained growth \nand sustainable development.  \n26. We recognize that landlocked developing countries and their transit country \nneighbours need to effectively mobilize adequate domestic and external resources, \n\nPolitical Declaration of the High-level Midterm Review on the Implementation of the Vienna \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014\u20132024 \nA/RES/74/15\n \n5/9\n19-20986 \n \nboth public and private, for the effective implementation of the Vienna Programme of \nAction. We acknowledge the importance of cohesive, nationally owned sustainable \ndevelopment strategies, supported by integrated national financing frameworks. We \nnote that the average tax revenue in landlocked developing countries is not sufficient \nto meet development needs. We express concern that illicit financial flows have an \nadverse impact on domestic resource mobilization and on the sustainability of public \nfinances in landlocked developing countries.  \n27. We commend the greater international attention that has been given to \nlandlocked developing countries since the adoption of the Vienna Programme of \nAction, including increased official development assistance and aid for trade and \nSouth-South and triangular cooperation. We reaffirm the need for renewed and \nstrengthened partnerships for the landlocked developing countries\u2019 development. We \nwelcome that official development assistance flows to landlocked developing \ncountries have increased in real terms. At the same time, we note that much of the \nofficial development assistance continues to be concentrated in a few landlocked \ndeveloping countries. We also express concern over the continued decline in foreign \ndirect investment flows to landlocked developing countries, which is an impediment \nto their economic growth. \n \n \n \nCall for action to accelerate the implementation of the Vienna Programme \nof Action \n \n28. Having noted the progress made and challenges encountered by landlocked \ndeveloping countries in the implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action, \nwhich is integral to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we call for action \nin the following key areas. \n29. We underscore the need to capture data to monitor the specific objectives of the \nVienna Programme of Action and commit to providing landlocked developing \ncountries with capacity-building support to strengthen their national statistical \nsystems. \n30. We commit to targeted and accelerated action to remove all legal, social and \neconomic barriers to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and \ngirls, and the realization and enjoyment of their human rights.  \n31. We underscore the importance of mobilizing adequate resources to accelerate \nthe implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action and to support the landlocked \ndeveloping countries in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and targets by \n2030.  \n32. We call upon landlocked developing countries and transit countries to \neffectively implement their obligations under all relevant international, regional and \nbilateral agreements to improve transit in a manner consistent with their trade and \ndevelopment objectives. \n33. Landlocked developing countries and transit countries should consider \npromoting a corridor approach to improve trade and transit transport. We call upon \nlandlocked developing countries and transit countries to make additional efforts to \nreduce travel time along the corridors and to adopt an integrated and sustainable \napproach to the management of international transport corridors in order to avoid the \nduplication of efforts, to promote regional connectivity and to maximize the \nassociated economic opportunities. \n34. We call upon the United Nations system and other relevant international and \nregional organizations to provide, within their mandates, policy, analytical and \ntechnical support towards the development, functioning and management of \ncorridors. \n\nA/RES/74/15 \nPolitical Declaration of the High-level Midterm Review on the Implementation of the Vienna \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014\u20132024\n \n19-20986\n6/9 \n \n35. We encourage landlocked developing countries and transit countries to integrate \nthe development, upgrading and maintenance of national and transboundary transport \ninfrastructure into their national development strategies. \n36. We call upon landlocked developing countries and transit countries, with the \nsupport of their development and trade partners, to develop regionally integrated, \nsustainable, climate- and disaster-resilient transport infrastructure and to close \nmissing links in order to reduce the cost of doing business and increase intraregional \ntrade. \n37. We encourage landlocked developing countries and transit countries to create \nan enabling environment for public and private sustainable investment and \ninfrastructure operations. \n38. We encourage landlocked developing countries and transit countries to expand \nand upgrade supply, transmission and distribution infrastructure for electricity, \nincluding off-grid solutions, to accelerate the preparation of power projects, \nespecially renewables, while acknowledging the role of all energy sources and \ntechnologies in the energy mix, to scale up projects on cross-border interconnectors \nand to improve transformational energy access and ensure access to affordable, \nreliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.  \n39. We invite landlocked developing countries and transit countries to collaborate \nto establish information and communications technology infrastructure, applications \nand services with the support of Governments, the private sector, development \npartners, multilateral financial and development institutions and regional banks. The \nsubstantial digital divides between landlocked developing countries and the \ndeveloped countries need to be addressed. \n40. We call upon development partners, the United Nations system, international \nfinancial institutions and international and regional organizations to provide technical \nsupport to landlocked developing countries for the formulation and implementation \nof bankable infrastructure and transport development projects. \n41. We encourage landlocked developing countries to continue to formulate policies \nand strategies aimed at diversifying their export structure and adding value to their \nexports in order to expand their participation in sustainable regional and global value \nchains. \n42. We encourage landlocked developing countries, with the support of their \ndevelopment and trade partners, to reduce \u201cbefore the border\u201d trade costs by \nimproving transport networks and customs procedures, as well as by the application \nof technology-driven and information and communications technology solutions to \nexpedite international trade.  \n43. We reaffirm the importance of the World Trade Organization Agreement on \nTrade Facilitation in addressing high trade and transit costs and call for full and timely \nimplementation of the Agreement by all the members of the World Trade \nOrganization. Landlocked developing countries should promptly notify their \ntechnical assistance needs. We also invite development partners and relevant \norganizations to enhance support to landlocked developing countries to implement \ntheir World Trade Organization commitments. \n44. We call upon all Member States to enhance market access for exports from \nlandlocked developing countries, except for arms and armaments. We also call upon \ndevelopment partners to support efforts by landlocked developing countries to \ndiversify their exports, including through supporting their national export strategies \nand trade policies.  \n\nPolitical Declaration of the High-level Midterm Review on the Implementation of the Vienna \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014\u20132024 \nA/RES/74/15\n \n7/9\n19-20986 \n \n45. We call upon development partners and multilateral development banks to \nsupport landlocked developing countries in strengthening trade financing for micro-, \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises and promoting trade finance facilitation \nprogrammes.   \n46. We underscore the potential for landlocked developing countries to facilitate \ntheir integration into regional and global value chains and to expand their trade \ncapabilities and connectivity by strengthening productive linkages, supporting the \ndevelopment of supply chains within the region and improving the quality and the \neffective implementation of regional integration agreements.  \n47. We call upon the United Nations system, regional and international development \npartners and other international organizations to support landlocked developing \ncountries and transit countries in leveraging the opportunities provided by regional \ninitiatives and integration. \n48. We encourage landlocked developing countries to promote innovative solutions \nin sectors such as agriculture, transport, information and communications, finance, \nenergy, health, water and sanitation and education, and effective public-private \npartnerships through investments in education and skills development, including \ntechnical, vocational and tertiary education and training, while ensuring gender \nequality and the empowerment of women and girls at all levels. We recognize that \nthese investments are required to reduce economic volatility, enable landlocked \ndeveloping countries to reap the demographic dividend, and achieve lifelong learning \nand broader human development.  \n49. We call upon landlocked developing countries to encourage private sector \ndevelopment by enhancing private sector capabilities, as well as improving economic \ngovernance and business regulations.  \n50. We are determined to build economies and societies in landlocked developing \ncountries that are resilient to external economic shocks, disasters and the adverse \nimpact of climate change and environmental degradation. We urge development \npartners, the United Nations system and other international and regional organizations \nto support landlocked developing countries\u2019 efforts to develop and implement \nnationally determined contributions and national long-term climate change strategies \nin line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and to develop tools to prevent and \ncombat desertification, land degradation, biodiversity loss, drought and receding \nglaciers, as well as to strengthen integrated water resources management, disaster risk \nprevention, preparedness and response, and early warning and early action systems.  \n51. We encourage development partners to support landlocked developing countries \nin building institutional and human capacities. \n52. We call upon the United Nations system to provide assistance to countries \ngraduating from the least developed country category in the implementation of their \nnational transition strategies and to consider country-specific support for graduated \ncountries for a fixed period of time and in a predictable manner, and call upon \ndevelopment partners to support smooth transition.  \n53. We encourage landlocked developing countries to strengthen their services \nsector and enhance their efforts to integrate into e-commerce. In this regard, we \nencourage international partners to provide capacity-building to assist landlocked \ndeveloping countries in addressing gaps in legal and regulatory frameworks and \ndeveloping digital skills. \n54. We encourage landlocked developing countries to develop national science, \ntechnology and innovation policies and to create enabling science, technology and \ninnovation infrastructure. We invite development partners and international \n\nA/RES/74/15 \nPolitical Declaration of the High-level Midterm Review on the Implementation of the Vienna \nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014\u20132024\n \n19-20986\n8/9 \n \norganizations to support efforts by landlocked developing countries to establish or \nstrengthen national and regional centres for science, technology and innovation \ndevelopment. \n55. We welcome existing technology and research funds established by \ndevelopment partners and international and regional financial institutions, and \nencourage similar initiatives to support landlocked developing countries for a greater \nuse and adaptation of technology.  \n56. We encourage landlocked developing countries to continue to make improvements \nin the regulatory environment for business, in particular for micro-, small and medium-\nsized enterprises. We also urge enhanced international and domestic investments in \nresearch and development in landlocked developing countries. \n57. We encourage landlocked developing countries to strengthen their efforts in \nraising domestic resources, including through carrying out reforms in tax \nadministration, broadening the tax base and strengthening domestic capital markets, \nand call upon the international community to assist these efforts in line with national \npriorities. \n58. We call upon development partners to strengthen support to landlocked \ndeveloping countries, taking into account all sources. At the same time, we encourage \nlandlocked developing countries to better leverage official development assistance \nfor attracting further finance from other sources, such as foreign direct investment, \npublic-private sector partnerships and other sources of finance.  \n59. We encourage Member States to facilitate foreign direct investment flows to \nlandlocked developing countries and call upon landlocked and transit developing \ncountries to promote an enabling environment to attract foreign direct investment and \nprivate sector involvement. \n60. We call upon development partners to continue to provide aid for trade to \nlandlocked developing countries, consistent with World Trade Organization \nguidelines.  \n61. We call upon the developing and developed countries to continue to support \nlandlocked developing countries through South-South and triangular cooperation in \nline with the respective modalities of cooperation. \n62. We welcome the establishment of the International Think Tank for Landlocked \nDeveloping Countries and call upon all landlocked developing countries that have not \ndone so to ratify or accede to the multilateral agreement for its establishment. We \ninvite Member States and other relevant stakeholders to consider making voluntary \ncontributions to the Think Tank budget.  \n63. We call upon the United Nations system, including the regional economic \ncommissions, as well as all relevant international and regional organizations, to \ncontinue to provide the support necessary to accelerate the implementation of the \nVienna Programme of Action. \n64. We call upon the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed \nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States to \ncontinue to ensure the coordinated follow-up to, effective monitoring of and reporting \non the implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action. \n65.
