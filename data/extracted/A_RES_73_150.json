Also reaffirms that respect by States for their protection responsibilities \ntowards refugees is strengthened by international solidarity involving all members of \nthe international community and that the refugee protection regime is enhanced \nthrough committed international cooperation in a spirit of solidarity and burden- and \nresponsibility-sharing among all States;  \n \n23. Further reaffirms that host States have the primary responsibility to ensure \nthe civilian and humanitarian character of asylum, calls upon States, in cooperation \nwith international organizations, within their mandates, to take all measures necessary \nto ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection and, in particular, to ensure \nthat the civilian and humanitarian nature of refugee camps is not compromised by the \npresence or the activities of armed elements or used for purposes that are incompatible \nwith their civilian character, and encourages the High Commissioner to continue \nefforts, in consultation with States and other relevant actors, to ensure the civilian and \nhumanitarian character of camps;  \n \n24.

Deplores the continuing violence and insecurity, which constitute an \nongoing threat to the safety and security of staff members of the Office of the High \nCommissioner and other humanitarian organizations and an obstacle to the effective \nfulfilment of the mandate of the Office and the ability of its implementing partners \nand other humanitarian personnel to discharge their respective humanitarian \nfunctions, urges States, parties to conflict and all other relevant actors to take all \nmeasures necessary to protect activities related to humanitarian assistance, prevent \nattacks on and kidnapping of national and international humanitarian workers and \nensure the safety and security of the personnel and property of the Office and that of \nall humanitarian organizations discharging functions mandated by the Office, and \ncalls upon States to investigate fully any crime committed against humanitarian \npersonnel and bring to justice the persons responsible for such crimes;  \n \n26.

Reaffirms the right of return, in accordance with international law, and the \nprinciple of voluntary repatriation, appeals to countries of origin and countries of \nasylum to create conditions that are conducive to voluntary repatriation, and \nrecognizes that, while voluntary repatriation remains the pre-eminent solution, local \nintegration and third-country resettlement, where appropriate and feasible, are also \nviable options for dealing with the situation of African refugees who, owing to \nprevailing circumstances in their respective countries of origin, are unable to return \nhome;  \n \n29. Also reaffirms that voluntary repatriation should not necessarily be \nconditioned on the accomplishment of political solutions in the country of origin in \norder not to impede the exercise of the refugees\u2019 right to return, recognizes that the \nvoluntary repatriation and reintegration process is normally guided by the conditions \nin the country of origin, in particular that voluntary repatriation can be accomplished \nin conditions of safety and dignity, and urges the High Commissioner to promote \nsustainable return through the development of durable and lasting solutions, \nparticularly in protracted refugee situations;  \n__________________ \n \n13  United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2051, No. 35457. \n\nA/RES/73/150 \nAssistance to refugees, returnees and displaced persons in Africa\n \n18-22203\n8/9 \n \n \n30.
