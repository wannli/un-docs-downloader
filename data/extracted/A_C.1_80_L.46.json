and \nNorthern Ireland: draft resolution \n \n \n \n Artificial intelligence in the military domain and its implications \nfor international peace and security \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecalling its resolution 79/239 of 24 December 2024, \n \nAffirming that international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, \ninternational humanitarian law and international human rights law, applies to matters \ngoverned by it that occur throughout the life cycle of artificial intelligence capabilities \nas well as the systems that they enable in the military domain, \n \nStressing the importance of ensuring the responsible application of artificial \nintelligence in the military domain, which, for the purpose of this resolution, includes \nhuman-centric, accountable, safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence used \nin compliance with international law, \n \nBearing in mind that this resolution focuses on the whole life cycle of artificial \nintelligence capabilities applied in the military domain, including the stages of \npre-design, design, development, evaluation, testing, deployment, use, sale, \nprocurement, operation and decommissioning, and that this resolution does not cover \nartificial intelligence in the civilian domain,  \n \nMindful that States have started to increasingly integrate artificial intelligence \ninto a broad array of applications in the military domain, including into weapons, \nweapon systems and other means and methods of warfare, as well as systems that \nsupport military operations, and noting its operational use, \n\nA/C.1/80/L.46 \n \n25-16694\n2/4 \n \n \nCognizant of potential implications for international peace and security, in \nparticular in the fields of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, resulting \nfrom developments related to the application of artificial intelligence in the military \ndomain,  \n \nRecognizing the need to enhance a shared understanding of potential effects of \nartificial intelligence in the military domain to harness the benefits while minimizing \nthe risks of its use, and the need to further assess them, \n \nMindful of the potential opportunities and benefits of artificial intelligence in \nthe military domain, such as in the areas of compliance with international humanitarian \nlaw, including protection of civilians and civilian objects in armed conflict, \n \nMindful also of the challenges and concerns that the application of artificial \nintelligence in the military domain raises from humanitarian, legal, security, \ntechnological and ethical perspectives, as well as the possible impact of such \napplications on international security and stability, including the risk of an arms race, \nmiscalculation, lowering the threshold for conflict and escalation of conflict and \nacquisition by non-State actors, and noting the possible consequences with regard to, \ninter alia, gender, racial, age or social aspects that could potentially be caused by bias \nin data sets or other algorithmic biases of artificial intelligence, \n \nMindful further of the need for States to implement appropriate safeguards, \nincluding measures that relate to human judgment and control over the use of force, \nin order to ensure the responsible application of artificial intelligence in the military \ndomain consistent with their respective obligations under applicable international \nlaw, \n \nTaking note of the report of the Secretary-General on current developments in \nscience and technology and their potential impact on international security and \ndisarmament efforts,1  \n \nRecognizing the need to narrow the existing digital and artificial intelligence \ndivides in societies and economies between and within developed and developing \ncountries, with specific consideration given to the needs, priorities and conditions of \ndeveloping countries, and therefore cognizant of the importance of enhancing \ninternational cooperation and strengthening capacity-building,  \n \nRecognizing also the criticality of enhanced understanding and awareness of the \nimplications of artificial intelligence in the military domain, including through \nknowledge exchange and the sharing of good practices and lessons learned among all \nStates, \n \nAcknowledging the contribution of United Nations entities and international and \nregional organizations, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross, \nacademia, civil society, the scientific and technical community and the private sector, \nin supporting States in understanding and addressing the peace and security \nimplications of the application of artificial intelligence in the military domain, and \nunderlining the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach, \n \nAcknowledging also national, regional, subregional and global efforts \nundertaken to address the potential risks to international peace and security that could \nbe raised by the application of artificial intelligence in the military domain, including \nthrough the development of relevant national strategies, legislation, principles, \nnorms, policies and measures, and recognizing the importance of promoting dialogue \nat all levels,  \n__________________ \n \n1  A/80/237. \n\nA/C.1/80/L.46\n \n3/4\n25-16694 \n \n \nTaking note of the discussions currently taking place in the Disarmament \nCommission on recommendations on common understandings related to emerging \ntechnologies in the context of international security and in the Conference on \nDisarmament, and noting also the meetings of the Security Council on artificial \nintelligence and international peace and security, held on 18 July 2023, 19 December \n2024, 4 April 2025 and 24 September 2025, \n \nAcknowledging the urgent need for the international community to address the \nchallenges and concerns raised by emerging technologies in the area of lethal \nautonomous weapons systems, in particular through the ongoing and valuable work \nof the Group of Governmental Experts on Emerging Technologies in the Area of Lethal \nAutonomous Weapons Systems, established under the Convention on Prohibitions or \nRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons,2 and welcoming the progress \nmade in these discussions, as well as taking note of the report of the Secretary-General \nsubmitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 78/241 of 22 December 2023 on \nlethal autonomous weapons systems,3 as well as the need to ensure complementarity \nbetween discussions in this regard and discussions on the broader security \nimplications of artificial intelligence in the military domain,  \n \nRecognizing the value of an inclusive multilateral exchange of views on \nartificial intelligence in the military domain and its implications for international \npeace and security, \n \n1. \nReaffirms that international law, including the Charter of the United \nNations, international humanitarian law and international human rights law, applies \nto matters governed by it that occur throughout all stages of the life cycle of artificial

opportunities and challenges posed to international peace and security \nby the application of artificial intelligence in the military domain, with specific focus \non areas other than lethal autonomous weapon systems, which reflects various views \nof the international community; \n \n3. \nInvites States to take into account the observations and conclusions \ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General when discussing the implications of \nartificial intelligence in the military domain, mindful of both the opportunities and \nchallenges, including from the humanitarian, legal, security, technological and ethical \nperspectives identified therein, with regard to international peace and security; \n \n4. \nEncourages States to continue to pursue national, regional, subregional \nand global efforts to address the opportunities and challenges, including from \nhumanitarian, legal, security, technological and ethical perspectives, related to the \napplication of
