despite the fact that increased global and national investments \nin malaria control have yielded significant results in decreasing the burden of malaria \nin many countries, and that some countries are moving towards the elimination of \nmalaria, many countries continue to have unacceptably high burdens of malaria and, \nin order to reach the internationally agreed development goals, including the \nSustainable Development Goals, must rapidly increase malaria prevention and control \nefforts, which rely heavily on medicines and insecticides whose utility is continuously \nthreatened by the development of resistance to antimalarial agents, as well as \nresistance of mosquitoes to insecticides and their shift to outdoor biting and resting, \n \nAware that recent successes in prevention and control are fragile and can be \nmaintained only with sufficient and sustained national and international investment \nto fund global malaria control efforts fully,  \n \nRegretting the high number of people still without access to medicines, and \nunderscoring that improving access to medicines could save millions of lives every year, \n \nRecognizing the serious challenges relating to

global effort will be needed to \nsubstantially reduce malaria transmission, morbidity and mortality by 2030 and \nachieve the targets set in the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016\u20132030,  \n \nRecognizing that progress can be accelerated through a multi-pronged response \nby expanding currently available life-saving interventions, making malaria a higher \npolitical priority and considering malaria control as an integrated part of the health \nsystem, increasing \naccountability, strengthening regional and cross-border \ncollaboration, and ensuring that the development and use of new tools and approaches \nare maximized,  \n \nGravely concerned about the health burden of malaria worldwide, with \n216 million cases and 445,000 deaths reported in 2016 alone, 11  in particular in \nsub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 91 per cent of the deaths occur, affecting \nmostly young children,  \n \nEmphasizing the importance of strengthening health systems to effectively \nsustain malaria control and elimination efforts and enable appropriate responses to \nother health issues and emergencies, including investment in entomology and vector \ncontrol for human resources and infrastructures,  \n \nRecognizing the critical need to strengthen malaria surveillance and data quality \nin all regions where malaria is endemic in order to accurately measure progress, \ncombat resurgence and target resources, particularly in the face of growing resistance \nto treatment and preventive measures, and recognizing also that additional financing \nis needed to strengthen national and regional surveillance systems and to support the \nsharing and analysis of best practices to address urgent programmatic challenges, \nimprove monitoring and evaluation, and conduct regular financial planning and gap \nanalyses,  \n \nAcknowledging that the expansion of malaria interventions can be used as an \nentry point for strengthening health systems more broadly,
