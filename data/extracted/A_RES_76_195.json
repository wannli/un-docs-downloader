reliable electricity and network connections, as well as in \npayment systems and other financial infrastructure, and encourages Member States to \ntake policy actions in accordance with national circumstances and priorities; \n \n6. \nAcknowledges the important role that national financial inclusion \nstrategies can play in identifying and overcoming financing gaps and binding \nconstraints,

inclusion for sustainable development\n \n21-19298\n4/6 \n \nStates to consider the convenience of adopting and pursuing national financial \ninclusion strategies and gender-responsive strategies, to end the structural barriers to \nwomen\u2019s equal access to economic resources and to expand peer learning, experience-\nsharing and capacity-building among countries and regions in this respect; \n \n7. \nRecognizes that digitally enabled innovation in the financial sector has \ncontributed significantly to the rapid expansion of access to financial services and \nfinancial inclusion, enabling progress on the Sustainable Development Goals and \nshowing impacts across the 2030 Agenda, as outlined in the Financing for Sustainable \nDevelopment Report 2021, and supports concrete actions to advance digital financial \ninclusion and close digital divides, including the gender digital divide, across and \nwithin countries, while improving responsible digital financial practices and \npromoting regulatory responses, as appropriate, to protect consumers\u2019 interests, \nfinancial integrity and system stability, which are mutually reinforcing and also \nenablers of greater financial inclusion; \n \n8. \nAlso recognizes the growing importance of financial technology actors and \nnew instruments and platforms, including mobile banking and peer-to-peer platforms, \nwhich have enabled access to financial services for millions of people and provided \nchannels for smaller companies to raise risk capital, as well as the potential of big \ndata and artificial intelligence in this respect, encourages, in this context, \nGovernments and regulatory agencies to review and adjust, as appropriate, legal and \nregulatory frameworks to cope with the risks and maximize the benefits associated \nwith these new instruments, and invites countries to exchange experiences and \npromote peer learning in this area and further enhance capacity-building in this \nregard; \n \n9. \nEncourages the use of digital financial technologies and services which \nhave gained further importance during the pandemic and have allowed many \nhouseholds and micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises to access financial \nservices despite lockdowns and social distancing; considers that digital financial \ninclusion is associated with higher gross domestic product growth and that the \nadoption of digital payments is consistent with the notion that financial technologies \nmay contribute to growth and sustainable development and thus play an important \nrole in mitigating the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and support the \nrecovery; promotes financial innovation and its role in enhancing financial inclusion \nand fostering more inclusive and equitable access to the benefits of the emerging \ndigital economy; acknowledges the needs of the poorest and of the people in the most \nvulnerable situations, while acknowledging the importance of more inclusive and

finance and support of micro-, \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, including those owned and operated by women; \n \n10. Invites further use of digital financial technologies in the delivery of \ngovernment assistance in an effective and secure manner, taking into account that \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic digital financial services enabled contactless and \ncashless transactions; and that advanced digital financial inclusion facilitates the \nefficient and quick deployment of government support measures benefiting micro-, \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises and people, including the poorest and most \nvulnerable, who are affected disproportionately by the pandemic, in turn allowing \nGovernments to expand the reach of their emergency responses to those in the \ninformal sector and those who do not have access to bank accounts, while functioning \nas an enabler of the Sustainable Development Goals, including eradicating poverty, \nbridging inequality gaps, creating jobs and promoting gender equality and the \n\nFinancial inclusion for sustainable development \nA/RES/76/195\n \n5/6\n21-19298 \n \nempowerment of women and girls, and in that regard calls for the strengthening of \ndigital skills and digital financial infrastructure to promote a sustainable, inclusive \nand resilient recovery; \n \n11. \nAcknowledges that, in the absence of strong financial consumer protection, \nthe growth-enhancing benefits of expanded financial inclusion may be lost or severely \nundermined, and in this regard stresses the importance of scaled-up action to improve \nfinancial and digital literacy and effective consumer protection for the poorest and \nmost vulnerable, including for women, young people, rural residents and migrants; \n \n12. Also acknowledges the efforts and actions on financial inclusion for \nsustainable development undertaken by a wide range of stakeholders working in \npartnership, such as the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, the Better Than Cash \nAlliance, the Special Advocate of the Secretary-General for Inclusive Finance for \nDevelopment and the Group of 20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion, urges \nthem to engage in an inclusive and transparent manner with Member States in their \nwork, in order to ensure that their initiatives complement or strengthen the United \nNations system, including the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the \nregional commissions, and encourages enhanced coordination and cooperation with \nthe Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development; \n \n13. Encourages the international community, including Member States, and \nall relevant stakeholders, including the entities of the United Nations system, \ninternational financial institutions, other intergovernmental bodies, regional and \nnational development banks, domestic financial institutions, credit unions, multi-\nstakeholder \npartnerships \nand \nrelevant \nnon-governmental \norganizations, \nas \nappropriate, to further develop financial literacy and financial education programmes \nthat include an emphasis on the impact of finance on sustainable development, as \nappropriate, in order to ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills \nneeded to access financial services, in particular women and girls, farmers and those \nworking in micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises; \n \n14. Encourages Member States and all relevant stakeholders, as appropriate, \nin the context of a renewed and strengthened Global Partnership for Sustainable \nDevelopment, led by Governments, to further efforts to reduce the transaction costs \nof migrant remittances to less than 3 per cent by 2030 and eliminate remittance \ncorridors with costs higher than 5 per cent by 2030, considering that there was limited \nimprovement in 2020 and that the global average is about 6.5 per cent, to support \nnational authorities in addressing the most significant obstacles to the continued flow \nof remittances, such as the trend of banks withdrawing services, and to work towards \nexpanding access to and the volume of remittances through regulated and transparent \nchannels, and in this regard highlights the potential of financial technology services \nto offer alternative channels and reduce remittance costs; \n \n15. Looks forward to the continuing consideration of financial inclusion in the \nforthcoming reports of the Inter-Agency Task Force on financing for sustainable \ndevelopment, as appropriate and in accordance with existing mandates, as well as in \nthe annual report of the Secretary-General on progress towards the achievement of \nthe Sustainable Development Goals, and to the further consideration of financial \ninclusion for sustainable development at the 2022 Economic and Social Council \nforum on financing for development follow-up; \n \n16.
