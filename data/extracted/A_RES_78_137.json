of 25 September 2015, entitled \u201cTransforming \nour world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d, in which it adopted a \ncomprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative \nSustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for \nthe full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating \npoverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest \nglobal challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its \ncommitment to achieving

Development Goals and seeking \nto address their unfinished business,  \n \nReaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa \nAction Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, \nwhich is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports \nand complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with \nconcrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to \n\nA/RES/78/137 \nExternal debt sustainability and development\n \n23-25928\n2/12 \n \naddress the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels \nfor sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity,  \n \nReaffirming further the Paris Agreement,1 and encouraging all its parties to fully \nimplement the Agreement, and parties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change2 that have not yet done so to deposit their instruments of \nratification, acceptance, approval or accession, where appropriate, as soon as possible,  \n \nRecalling the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its \nImpact on Development and its outcome document,3  \n \nRecalling also the 2023 Economic and Social Council forum on financing for \ndevelopment follow-up and its intergovernmentally agreed conclusions and \nrecommendations,4  \n \nWelcoming the convening of the High-level Dialogue on Financing for \nDevelopment held in New York on 20 September 2023,  \n \nEmphasizing that debt sustainability is essential for underpinning growth, \nunderlining the importance of debt sustainability, debt transparency and effective debt \nmanagement to the efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and \nacknowledging that debt crises are costly and disruptive, including for employment \nand productive investment, and tend to be followed by cuts in public spending, \nincluding on health and education, affecting the poor and vulnerable in particular,  \n \nReaffirming that each country has primary responsibility for its own \ndevelopment, including through maintaining its own debt sustainability, and that the \nrole of national policies and development strategies, including in the area of debt \nmanagement, is central to the achievement of sustainable development, and \nrecognizing that national efforts, including to achieve development goals and to \nmaintain debt sustainability, should be complemented by supportive global \nprogrammes, measures and policies aimed at expanding the development \nopportunities of developing countries, while taking into account national conditions \nand ensuring respect for national ownership, strategies and sovereignty,  \n \nNoting the increasing share of domestic borrowing, and acknowledging that the \ndevelopment of domestic bond markets can contribute to fiscal and financial \nresilience and mitigate exchange rate risks in times of financial turbulence, while \nnoting that excessive borrowing from the domestic banking system could also \nexacerbate vulnerabilities through the sovereign-bank nexus, in the event of a crisis,  \n \nReiterating that debt sustainability depends on a confluence of many factors at \nthe international and national levels, and emphasizing that country-specific \ncircumstances and the impact of external shocks, such as volatile commodity and \nenergy prices, more intense and frequent natural disasters and international capital \nflows, should continue to be taken into account in debt sustainability analyses,  \n \nExpressing concern that a development setback is already under way, with \nelevated debt burdens further hampering efforts to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and strengthen economic resilience, and that, for developing \ncountries, keeping debt default at bay has come with difficult policy decisions, which \nmay create constraints on mobilizing the resources needed to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment,  \n__________________ \n \n1  See FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21, annex. \n \n2  United Nations, Treaty Series, vol.

that tighter global financial conditions have \ncontributed significantly to a finance divide between and within countries, leading to \nhigher external borrowing costs, which could, inter alia, make it more difficult for \ndeveloping countries to pay for external debt servicing and could push more countries \ntowards debt distress, and undermine their debt sustainability, \n \nExpressing concern about the adverse impact of and risks resulting from the \ncontinuing fragility of the global economy and the slow pace of the restoration of \nglobal growth and trade, including the impact on development, net negative capital \nflows from some emerging and developing economies and inequalities for young \npeople, women, persons with disabilities, people in rural and remote areas and other \npeople in vulnerable situations, underlining that global growth has remained strongly \ndependent on unprecedented increases in global debt stocks and, in conjunction with \nthe fast integration of developing countries into international financial markets, \nincluding for purposes of debt refinancing, exposes a growing number of developing \neconomies to highly sensitive and amplified reactions in financial markets, and \nstressing the need for continuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances \nand to reform and strengthen the international financial system, while implementing \nthe reforms agreed upon to date to attend to these challenges and to make progress \ntowards sustaining global demand,  \n \nUnderlining that, globally, the gross domestic product growth rate could \nincrease significantly if every country achieved gender equality, and recognizing that \nthe economic and social losses owing to a lack of progress in achieving gender \nequality and the empowerment of women and girls are significant,  \n \nRecognizing with concern that, in 2022, the external debt positions of many \ndeveloping countries remained alarmingly high, of which several had continued to \ndeteriorate, with external debt stocks of developing countries reaching a level of \n11.4 trillion United States dollars,  \n \nRecognizing the important role, on a case-by-case basis, of debt relief, including \ndebt cancellation, as appropriate, and debt restructuring as debt crisis prevention, \nmanagement and resolution tools,  \n \nRecalling the Sendai Declaration and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \nReduction 2015\u20132030,5 reiterating that severe natural disasters and social or \neconomic shocks can pose immediate fiscal challenges or undermine a country\u2019s debt \nsustainability, and noting that public creditors have taken steps to ease debt repayment \nobligations through debt rescheduling and debt cancellation following an earthquake \nor a tsunami and in the context of the Ebola crisis in West Africa, noting the debt \nswap initiative of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, \nDebt for Climate Adaptation Swap, and encouraging consideration of further debt \nrelief steps, such as the use of State-contingent debt instruments where appropriate, \nand/or other measures for countries affected in this regard, as feasible,  \n \nRecalling also the call made in February 2022 by the Managing Director of the \nInternational Monetary Fund to prioritize help to those countries that need debt \nrestructuring, considering that the share of low-income countries at high risk or \nalready in debt distress has doubled since 2015,  \n \nExpressing deep concern that a number of countries in special situations, in \nparticular African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing \ncountries and small island developing States, as well as a growing number of middle-\nincome countries, face challenges in servicing their debt and that, in spite of \ninternational efforts, 52 per cent of low-income countries and 25 per cent of emerging \n__________________ \n \n5  Resolution 69/283, annexes I and II. \n\nA/RES/78/137 \nExternal debt sustainability and development\n \n23-25928\n4/12 \n \neconomies are considered by the International Monetary Fund as being in debt \ndistress or at high risk of debt distress, and the impact of high inflation and exchange \nrate fluctuations and rising international interest rates have significantly increased \ndebt servicing costs,  \n \nRecognizing with deep concern the debt challenges faced by sub-Saharan Africa \nreflected in the ratio of public and publicly guaranteed debt service to government \nrevenues, which increased to 18.4 per cent in 2022 from 13.6 per cent in 2021, to \nwhich the economic slowdown contributed,  \n \nExpressing deep concern that indicators of external debt sustainability of least \ndeveloped countries deteriorated in 2022, and that the ratio of total debt service to \nexport revenues rose to 18.9 per cent from 18.3 per cent in 2021, the share of \ngovernment revenues spent on servicing the public and publicly guaranteed debt rose \nto 17.0 per cent from 15.6 per cent in 2021 and the ratio of reserves to short-term debt \nfell from 336 per cent in 2021 to 277.5 per cent in 2022,  \n \nRecognizing with concern that, although the ratio of total debt service to export \nrevenues fell to 16.4 per cent in 2022 from 20.6 per cent in 2021, the liquidity buffer \nof small island developing States decreased to 148.3 per cent in 2022 from 181.9 per \ncent in 2021, making this group particularly vulnerable to external financial shocks,  \n \nRecognizing with concern also that the ratio of total external debt service to \nexports in low- and middle-income countries reached 13.2 per cent in 2022 and for \nlow-income countries this ratio rose to a level of 22.6 per cent of their export earnings, \n \nRecognizing with concern further that, prior to the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic, total external debt stocks of developing countries reached a \nnew record of 10 trillion dollars and rising external debt burdens continued to absorb a \ngrowing share of developing countries\u2019 resources and simultaneously the ability of \ndeveloping countries to self-insure against exogenous economic and non-economic \nshocks, and increased market risk through international reserve cushions continued to \nweaken, recognizing with concern also that there has been a deterioration in the external \ndebt sustainability of economies, in particular in the most vulnerable and in middle-\nincome countries throughout the crisis, despite efforts by the Group of 20, targeted at \nthe most vulnerable countries, and bilateral creditors, such as the Paris Club and non-\nParis Club members, and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to \naddress the challenges of debt sustainability, and encouraging them to continue their \nwork to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, socioeconomic crisis and the \nincrease in cost of living on debtor countries\u2019 debt sustainability,  \n \nRecognizing the importance of debt sustainability for the smooth transition of \ncountries graduating from least developed country status, as well as those that have \nalready graduated,  \n \nEmphasizing that international support, in the form of official development \nassistance and a coordinated multilateral effort to provide low-cost, long-term \ndevelopment financing, as well as enhanced domestic resource mobilization, which \nis the primary source of financing for development across all country classifications, \nare needed to address the growing challenges to developing countries\u2019 debt \nsustainability,  \n \nTaking note of the operational guidelines for sustainable financing promoted by \nthe Group of 20, while urging the Group to continue to engage in an inclusive and \ntransparent manner with other States Members of the United Nations in its work, in \norder to ensure that the initiatives of the Group complement or strengthen the United \nNations system, and noting the progress achieved in the implementation of the \noperational guidelines,  \n\nExternal debt sustainability and development \nA/RES/78/137\n \n5/12\n23-25928 \n \n \nNoting the need for coordinated efforts by the International Monetary Fund and \nthe World Bank to promote responsible, transparent and sustainable lending and \nborrowing,  \n \nNoting with concern that countries around the world continue to grapple with \nmultiple crises, including the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, climate change and \ngeopolitical tensions and conflicts which have accentuated food, energy and financial \nchallenges and undermined inclusive recovery and eradication of poverty, while rising \nrisk aversion has triggered capital outflows from emerging market economies, \ncausing adverse effects on the debt sustainability efforts of developing countries,  \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety \nand well-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as \nthe severe disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives \nand livelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the \npandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals by designing and implementing sustainable and inclusive \nrecovery strategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build \nresilience to future shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health \nsystems and achieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and \ntimely access for all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, \ntherapeutics and diagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, \nsolidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one behind,  \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment;6  \n \n2. \nEmphasizes the special importance of predictable, timely, effective, \ncomprehensive and durable solutions to the debt problems of developing countries to \npromote their economic growth and development;  \n \n3. \nRecognizes the importance, in particular, of new and emerging challenges \nand vulnerabilities in regard to developing country external debt sustainability arising \nfrom structural changes to overall debt composition, the rapid growth of private sector \ndebt in many emerging and developing countries and the growing use of new debt \nfinancing instruments and approaches;  \n \n4. \nNotes the growing concerns about fast-rising corporate debt, high-risk \nexposure to volatile international financial markets and fast-growing debt servicing \nburdens as potential triggers of financial and debt crises and the consequent need for \ncoordinated policy responses;  \n \n5. \nStresses the need to continue to assist developing countries in avoiding a \nbuild-up of unsustainable debt and in implementing resilience measures so as to \nreduce the risk of relapsing into another debt crisis, taking into account the challenges \nposed by the global economic environment and risks for debt sustainability in a \ngrowing number of developing countries;  \n \n6. \nAcknowledges the role played by the Debt Sustainability Framework for \nLow-Income Countries, jointly developed by the International Monetary Fund and the \nWorld Bank, to guide borrowing and lending decisions, and notes its operationalization \nin 2018 and the further enhancement of debt sustainability assessment frameworks, \nconsistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development7 and longer-term \nstructural transformation;  \n__________________ \n \n6  See A/78/229. \n \n7  Resolution 70/1. \n\nA/RES/78/137 \nExternal debt sustainability and development\n \n23-25928\n6/12 \n \n \n7. \nReiterates that no single indicator should be used to make definitive \njudgments about a country\u2019s debt sustainability, and, in view of the new challenges \nand vulnerabilities for developing countries\u2019 external debt sustainability, \nsubstantiated by the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment and recent joint analyses of the International Monetary Fund and the \nWorld Bank, stresses the need for improved data collection and quality in areas that \ninclude domestic public debt and domestic and external private debt, as well as legal \nand regulatory features, such as ownership, currency denomination and jurisdiction \naccording to national priorities, welcomes the work of the High-level Panel on the \nDevelopment of a Multidimensional Vulnerability Index for Small Island Developing \nStates, which was co-chaired by the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Gaston \nBrowne, and the former Prime Minister of Norway, Erna Solberg, including its \nconsultations with Member States, and in this regard takes note of the Panel\u2019s final \nreport and the recommendations contained therein;  \n \n8. \nAlso reiterates that timely and comprehensive data on the level and \ncomposition of debt are necessary for, inter alia, building early warning systems \naimed at limiting the impact of debt crises, calls for debtor and creditor countries to \nintensify their efforts to collect and release data, where appropriate, welcomes the \nongoing work of relevant institutions to apply innovative tools for monitoring \nfinancial stress in developing countries and to invite relevant institutions to consider \nthe creation of a central data registry that includes information on debt restructuring, \nand calls for donors to consider increasing their support for technical cooperation \nprogrammes aimed at increasing the statistical capacity of developing countries in \nthat regard;  \n \n9. \nEncourages the United Nations system, the World Bank Group, the \nInternational Monetary Fund and other relevant stakeholders, including the \nDevelopment Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development, to continue to conduct analytical activities and to provide policy \nadvice and technical assistance to Governments, upon request, in the areas of \nmanaging debt, and operating and maintaining databases, and in this regard recalls \nthat the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development should continue its \nanalytical and policy work and technical assistance on debt issues, including the Debt \nManagement and Financial Analysis System Programme, so that this extends not only \nto improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of debt data recording, but also to the \nenhanced coverage of public sector and other relevant debt data, including, in \nparticular, heretofore unrecorded or hidden debt instruments, contingent liabilities \nand more complex debt instruments;  \n \n10. Stresses the need to strengthen information-sharing and transparency \namong all creditors and borrowers to make sure that debt sustainability assessments \nare based on comprehensive, objective and reliable data, including an assessment of \nnational public and private debt, in order to ensure the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, encourages further improvement of the mutual exchange of \ninformation, on a voluntary basis, on borrowing and lending among all creditors and \nborrowers, and takes note of the Paris Forum initiative, which gathers together \nsovereign creditors and debtors to share views and information, promote greater debt \ntransparency and preserve debt sustainability;  \n \n11. \nRecognizes that the long-term sustainability of debt depends on, inter alia, \neconomic growth, the mobilization of domestic and international resources, the export \nprospects of debtor countries, sustainable debt management, sound macroeconomic \npolicies that also support job creation, transparent and effective regulatory \nframeworks and success in overcoming structural development problems and, hence, \non the creation of an enabling environment at all levels that is conducive to \nsustainable development, and also recognizes the need to assist developing countries \n\nExternal debt sustainability and development \nA/RES/78/137\n \n7/12\n23-25928 \n \nin attaining long-term debt sustainability, through coordinated policies aimed at \nfostering adequate debt financing and resolution tools, such as debt relief and debt \nrestructuring supporting sound debt management;  \n \n12. Notes with concern that some low- and middle-income developing \ncountries that were not part of the existing debt relief initiatives now have large debt \nburdens that may create constraints on mobilizing the resources needed to achieve the \nSustainable Development Goals, indicating a need to consider, as appropriate, \nstronger debt management initiatives for those countries, and stresses the importance \nof medium- and long-term debt sustainability to deal with debt, including non-Paris \nClub debt;  \n \n13. Underlines the fact that heavily indebted poor countries eligible for debt \nrelief will not be able to enjoy the full benefits unless all creditors, both public and \nprivate, contribute to debt workouts, as appropriate, in order to ensure the debt \nsustainability of those countries, and invites creditors, both private and public, that \nare not yet fully participating in debt relief initiatives to substantially increase their \nparticipation, including by providing comparable treatment to debtor countries that \nhave concluded sustainable debt relief agreements with creditors; \n \n14. Stresses the need for the international community to remain vigilant in \nmonitoring the debt situation of developing countries, including the least developed \ncountries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, and to \ncontinue to take effective measures, preferably within existing frameworks, when \napplicable, to address the debt problem of those countries, acknowledges that sound \ndebt management initiatives can play a key role in liberating resources that should be \ndirected towards activities consistent with the eradication of poverty in all its forms \nand dimensions, including extreme poverty, and with the promotion of sustained \neconomic growth and development and the internationally agreed development goals, \nincluding the Sustainable Development Goals, and in this regard urges countries to \ndirect the resources freed through debt relief, in particular through debt cancellation \nand reduction, towards achieving those objectives, while still maintaining sustainable \ndebt levels through prudent fiscal management, including in the context of the 2030 \nAgenda, according to their national priorities and strategies; \n \n15. Notes that countries can seek to negotiate, as a last resort, on a case-by-\ncase basis and through existing frameworks, agreements on temporary debt standstills \nbetween debtors and creditors in order to help to mitigate the adverse impacts of a \ndebt crisis and stabilize macroeconomic developments; \n \n16. Acknowledges the efforts of, and invites creditors to provide additional \nflexibility to, developing countries affected by natural disasters so as to allow them \nto address their national debt concerns, while taking into account their specific \neconomic and social situations and needs; \n \n17. Recognizes that the detrimental impact of disasters on the debt \nsustainability of many least developed countries, small island developing States and \nmiddle-income countries warrants further attention and that preserving external debt \nsustainability requires ex ante financing to enable the systematic reduction of disaster \nrisk and resilience-building, as well as the disclosure of disaster risk to avoid \nexacerbating debt distress, when feasible, and in this regard recognizes that many \nleast developed countries, small island developing States and middle-income \ncountries have limited access to financing to invest in disaster risk reduction for \nresilience before and after disasters, while noting the potential benefits of climate-\nresilient debt instruments;  \n \n18. Acknowledges that State-contingent debt instruments could further \nstrengthen borrower resilience, encourages the consideration of their use where \n\nA/RES/78/137 \nExternal debt sustainability and development\n \n23-25928\n8/12 \n \nappropriate, with a view to providing breathing room to countries hit by shocks, \nwelcomes the development of climate-resilient debt clauses, where appropriate, and \nfurther notes that clauses that consider other catastrophic external shocks could also \nbe developed;  \n \n19. Recognizes that, in some cases, the use of public debt and renewed external \nborrowing to absorb the impact of a disaster could lead to higher debt servicing for \ndeveloping countries and constrain their growth and their capacity to invest in long-\nterm resilience-building measures, and further acknowledges that, with each new \ndisaster, financial vulnerabilities grow and domestic response capacities weaken;  \n \n20. Also recognizes the importance of the creation of robust, nationally \nappropriate legal and regulatory frameworks for sustainable national and municipal \nborrowing, on the basis of sustainable debt management, supported by adequate \nrevenues and capacities, by means of local creditworthiness, as well as expanded \nsustainable municipal debt markets, when appropriate, and in this regard underlines \nthe importance of the establishment of appropriate financial intermediaries for urban \nfinancing, such as regional, national, subnational and local development funds or \ndevelopment banks, including pooled financing mechanisms, which can catalyse \npublic and private, national and international financing; \n \n21. Further recognizes that developing countries experiencing high debt \ndistress can concurrently experience socioeconomic challenges and stretched social \nsafety nets, and invites a multilateral response that supports these countries to achieve \ndebt sustainability and sustainable development; \n \n22. Underlines the importance of multilateral efforts to tackle increasingly \ncomplex cross-border challenges that have serious effects on development and debt \nsustainability; \n \n23. Recognizes with appreciation the steps taken by the Group of 20, in \nparticular under the presidencies of Saudi Arabia, Italy, Indonesia and India, to further \npromote debt-related measures and the implementation of the Debt Service \nSuspension Initiative and the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the \nDebt Service Suspension Initiative, and the recent agreements concluded under the \nCommon Framework, while recognizing that delays in the implementation of the \nCommon Framework may have impacted the confidence of some eligible countries \nand that the fear of downgrading inhibited some eligible countries from applying, \nemphasizes in that regard the need to further strengthen the Common Framework and \ncalls to implement it fully in a transparent, predictable, timely, orderly and \ncoordinated manner, including to increase the fiscal space of countries in debt \ndistress, encourages greater private sector participation through more clarity in \nassessing comparability of treatment, while also noting that more needs to be done to \nrespond to the need of countries not covered by current initiatives, including middle-\nincome countries, and in this regard reaffirms the growing urgency of dealing not \nonly with liquidity but also solvency risks;  \n \n24. Welcomes the special drawing rights allocation of the equivalent of \n650 billion United States dollars of 23 August 2021, commends the achievement of \nthe target of 100 billion dollars in pledges for rechannelling special drawing rights or \nequivalent contributions, recommends the exploration of further voluntary options \nrelated to special drawing rights that could serve the needs of developing member \ncountries of the International Monetary Fund, calls for the urgent voluntary \nrechannelling of special drawing rights for countries most in need, including through \nmultilateral development banks, while respecting relevant legal frameworks and \npreserving the reserve asset character of special drawing rights, and will explore ways \nfor future allocations of special drawing rights to benefit those countries most in need;  \n\nExternal debt sustainability and development \nA/RES/78/137\n \n9/12\n23-25928 \n \n \n25. Looks forward to the interim review of the Resilience and Sustainability \nTrust, considering the experiences with the Resilience and Sustainability Facility \nprogrammes; \n \n26. Recommends assisting developing countries in attaining long-term debt \nsustainability through coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt \nrelief, debt restructuring and sound debt management, as appropriate, to enhance the \nability of countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals;  \n \n27. Also recommends the facilitation of timely and orderly debt treatment with \nthe broad participation of all creditors, including those in the private sector, on \ncomparable terms, stresses the need in the medium term to strengthen information-\nsharing between debtors and creditors, as necessary, and long-term debt sustainability \nanalysis, based on comprehensive, objective, transparent and reliable data, and \ntechnical cooperation that takes account of the requirements of sustainable \ndevelopment and the 2030 Agenda, and emphasizes the urgency of strengthening \ninternational efforts and cooperation and responding to the call for the easing of debt \nburdens by addressing the debt vulnerability, in the immediate term, and the debt \nsustainability, in the long term, of heavily indebted developing countries;  \n \n28. Recognizes the role of the United Nations and of the international financial \ninstitutions, in accordance with their respective mandates, and encourages them to \ncontinue to support global efforts towards sustained and inclusive growth, sustainable \ndevelopment and the external debt sustainability of developing countries, including \nthrough continued monitoring of global financial flows and their implications in this \nregard;  \n \n29. Takes note of the Chair\u2019s statement in 2023 at the forty-eighth meeting of \nthe International Monetary and Financial Committee, in which it was stated that a \nreview of surcharge policies would be considered, and looks forward to this \ndiscussion;  \n \n30.
