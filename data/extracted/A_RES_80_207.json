Expresses its deep concern, in this regard, about the negative impact on \nthe realization of the right to development owing to the further aggravation of the \neconomic and social situation, in particular of developing countries, as a result of the \neffects of international energy, food and financial crises, as well as the increasing \nchallenges posed by global climate change and the loss of biodiversity, which have \nincreased vulnerabilities and inequalities and have adversely affected development \ngains, in particular in developing countries; \n \n29.
