recalling the panel discussion on the right \nto privacy in the digital age held during the twenty-seventh session of the Human \nRights Council,  \n \nNoting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all \nover the world to use new information and communications technologies and at the \nsame time enhances the capacity of Governments, companies and individuals to \nundertake surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse \nhuman rights, in particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil \nand Political Rights, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern,  \n \nNoting also that violations and abuses of the right to privacy in the digital age \nmay affect all individuals, with particular effects on women, as well as children and \nthose who are vulnerable and marginalized,  \n \nRecognizing that the promotion of and respect for the right to privacy are \nimportant to the prevention of violence, including gender-based violence, abuse and \nsexual harassment, in particular against women and children, which can

of the \nfoundations of a democratic society,  \n \nNoting with appreciation general comment No. 16 of the Human Rights \nCommittee on article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, \non the right to respect of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection \nof honour and reputation,12 while also noting the vast technological leaps that have \ntaken place since

rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to \nprivacy in the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and \nremedies, the impact of surveillance on the right to privacy and other human rights, \nas well as the need to examine the principles of non-arbitrariness, lawfulness, legality, \nnecessity and proportionality in relation to surveillance practices,  \n \nNoting the holding of the Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of \nInternet Governance (NETmundial) and the multi-stakeholder discussions that take \nplace annually in the

Internet governance issues and whose mandate was extended by \nthe General Assembly in 2015 for another 10 years,8 and recognizing that effectively \naddressing the challenges relating to the right to privacy in the context of modern \ncommunications technology requires an ongoing, concerted multi-stakeholder \nengagement,  \n \nEmphasizing that the protection and promotion of, and respect for, the right to \nprivacy benefit from sustained engagement, including through informal dialogues, \namong all stakeholders, including States, business enterprises, international \norganizations and civil society,  \n \nRecognizing that the discussion on the right to privacy should be based upon \nexisting international and domestic legal obligations, including international human \nrights law, as well as relevant commitments, and should not open the path for undue \ninterference with an individual\u2019s human rights,  \n \nStressing the importance of full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and \nimpart information, including the fundamental importance of access to information \nand democratic participation,  \n \nRecognizing that the right to privacy is important for the enjoyment of

be free from unlawful or arbitrary interference with the right to privacy \nmight affect the enjoyment of other human rights, including the right to freedom of \nexpression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to peaceful \nassembly and freedom of association,  \n \nNoting that, while metadata may provide benefits, certain types of metadata, \nwhen aggregated, can reveal personal information that can be no less sensitive than \nthe actual content of communications and can give an insight into an individual\u2019s \nbehaviour, social relationships, private preferences and identity,  \n \nExpressing concern that individuals often do not and/or cannot provide their \nfree, explicit and informed consent to the sale or multiple resale of their personal data, \nas the collecting, processing, use, storage and sharing of personal data, including \nsensitive data, have increased significantly in the digital age,  \n \nNoting with concern that profiling, automated decision-making and machine-\nlearning technologies, sometimes referred to as artificial intelligence, without proper \nsafeguards, may lead to decisions that have the potential to affect the enjoyment of \nhuman rights, including economic, social and cultural rights, and recognizing the need \nto apply international human rights law in the design, evaluation and regulation of \nthese practices,  \n \nEmphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of \ncommunications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, as \nhighly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with the right to \nfreedom of expression and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, \nincluding when undertaken extraterritorially or on a mass scale,  \n \nRecognizing that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected \nonline, including the right to privacy,  \n \nNoting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be \nconsistent with international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the \nbasis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, \ncomprehensive and non-discriminatory, and that any interference with the right to \nprivacy must not be arbitrary or unlawful, bearing in mind what is reasonable with \nregard to the pursuance of legitimate aims, and recalling that States that are parties to \n\nA/RES/73/179 \nThe right to privacy in the digital age\n \n18-22275\n4/7 \n \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must take the necessary steps \nto adopt laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights \nrecognized in the Covenant,  \n \nExpressing concern about the spread of disinformation and propaganda, \nincluding on the Internet, which can be designed and implemented so as to mislead, \nto violate human rights, including the right to privacy and to freedom of expression, \nand to incite violence, hatred, discrimination or hostility, and emphasizes the \nimportant contribution of journalists in countering this trend,  \n \nEmphasizing that States must respect international human rights obligations \nregarding the right to privacy when they intercept digital communications of \nindividuals and/or collect personal data, when they share or otherwise provide access \nto data collected through, inter alia, information- and intelligence-sharing agreements \nand when they require disclosure of personal data from third parties, including private \ncompanies,  \n \nNoting the increase in the collection of sensitive biometric information from \nindividuals, and stressing that States must respect their human rights obligations and \nthat business enterprises should respect the right to privacy and other human rights \nwhen collecting, processing, sharing and storing biometric information by, inter alia, \nconsidering the adoption of data protection policies and safeguards,  \n \nNoting also that general comment No. 16 recommends that States take effective \nmeasures to prevent the unlawful retention, processing and use of personal data stored \nby public authorities and business enterprises,  \n \nWelcoming measures taken by business enterprises, on a voluntary basis, to \nprovide transparency to their users about their policies regarding requests by State \nauthorities for access to user data and information,  \n \nDeeply concerned at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception \nof communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of \ncommunications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried \nout on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights,  \n \nEmphasizing that, in the digital age, technical solutions to secure and to protect \nthe confidentiality of digital communications, which may include measures for \nencryption, pseudonymization and anonymity, can be important to ensure the \nenjoyment of human rights, in particular the rights to privacy, to freedom of \nexpression and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and recognizing that \nStates should refrain from employing unlawful or arbitrary surveillance techniques, \nwhich may include forms of hacking,  \n \nNoting with deep concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations \nengaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, \njournalists and other media workers may frequently face threats and harassment and \nsuffer insecurity, as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their right to \nprivacy, as a result of their activities,  \n \nNoting that, while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and \nprotection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with \ntheir obligations under international human rights law,  \n \nNoting also, in that respect, that the prevention and suppression of terrorism is \na public interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that \nany measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations \nunder international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and \nhumanitarian law,  \n\nThe right to privacy in the digital age \nA/RES/73/179\n \n5/7\n18-22275 \n \n \nRecognizing that an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information \nand communications technology environment is important to the
