The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link between \nthe illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a \ncontribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecognizing that the trade in conflict diamonds continues to be a matter of \nserious international concern, which can be directly linked to the fuelling of armed \nconflict, the activities of rebel movements aimed at undermining or overthrowing \nlegitimate Governments and the illicit traffic in and proliferation of armaments, \nespecially small arms and light weapons,  \n \nRecognizing also the devastating impact of conflicts fuelled by the trade in \nconflict diamonds on peace and the safety and security of people in affected countries, \nand the systematic and gross human rights violations that have been perpetrated in \nsuch conflicts, \n \nExpressing deep concern regarding the unprecedented challenges faced by the \nKimberley Process arising from ongoing geopolitical tensions and conflicts,  \n \nNoting the negative impact of such conflicts on regional stability and the \nobligations placed upon States by the Charter of the United Nations regarding the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, and recognizing that continued \naction to curb the trade in conflict diamonds is imperative,  \n \nNoting also that the Kimberley Process remains a unique tripartite initiative that \nbrings together stakeholders in Government, industry and civil society in its quest to \nprevent conflict diamonds from entering the

\nDevelopment1 and the Sustainable Development Goals,  \n__________________ \n \n1 Resolution 70/1. \n\nA/RES/78/270 \nThe role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link between \nthe illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a\ncontribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts\n \n24-06186\n2/5 \n \n \nNoting with appreciation that the Kimberley Process, as an international \ninitiative led by participants, has pursued its deliberations on an inclusive basis \ninvolving concerned stakeholders, including producing, exporting and importing \nStates, the diamond industry and civil society, as well as applicant States and \ninternational organizations,  \n \nRecalling that conflict prevention and the elimination of conflict diamonds from \nlegitimate trade is the primary objective of the Kimberley Process, and stressing the \nneed to continue its activities in order to achieve this objective,  \n \nWelcoming the important contribution of the Kimberley Process, which was \ninitiated by African diamond-producing countries and supported by other Kimberley \nProcess participants, and calling for the consistent implementation of commitments \nmade by Kimberley Process participants and the diamond industry and civil society \norganizations, as observers,  \n \nAcknowledging the role that the Kimberley Process has played, in the past 21 \nyears, in stemming the flow of conflict diamonds and the significant development \nimpact it has had in improving the lives of many people dependent on the trade in \ndiamonds, and noting that the plenary meeting of the Kimberley Process, in looking \ntowards the future, committed to continue to ensure that the Kimberley Process \nremains relevant as a credible tool in curbing the flow of conflict diamonds, capturing \nthe evolving nature of conflicts and realities on the ground,  \n \nAcknowledging also that the diamond sector is an important catalyst for \npromoting economic and social development, which are necessary for poverty \nreduction and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in many producing \ncountries, particularly in developing countries, \n \nBearing in mind the positive benefits of the legitimate diamond trade to \nproducing countries, workers and their communities, and underlining the need for \ncontinued regional and international action to prevent the problem of conflict \ndiamonds from negatively affecting the trade in legitimate diamonds, which makes a \ncritical contribution to the economies of producing, exporting and importing States,  \n \nNoting that the total elimination of conflict diamonds from the diamond market \ncontinues to be the primary objective of the Kimberley Process, and stressing the need \nfor the Kimberley Process to continue evolving to meet the social and environmental \nchallenges in line with the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals,  \n \nRecognizing that the Kimberley Process promotes legitimate rough diamond \ntrade, and recalling the positive benefits of legitimate diamond trade to producing \ncountries, including its transparency and accountability throughout the diamond \nindustry, and the contribution it has made to the economies of producing, exporting \nand importing States, and therefore underlining the need for continued international \naction with regard to the ethical exploitation, sale and trade of rough diamonds,  \n \nExpressing appreciation for the continuous efforts made by Botswana in \nsupporting the operationalization of the Kimberley Process secretariat in Gaborone, \n \nWelcoming the efforts to enhance regional cooperation on Kimberley Process \nmatters, including among artisanal and alluvial diamond-producing countries in

of conflicts \nA/RES/78/270\n \n3/5\n24-06186 \n \n \nRecalling also General Assembly resolution 55/56 of 1 December 2001 and \nSecurity Council resolution 1459 (2003) of 28 January 2003, in which the Assembly \nand the Council strongly supported the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme as a \nvaluable contribution in breaking the link between the illicit transaction of rough \ndiamonds and armed conflict as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts,  \n \nNoting that the implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme \ncontinues to have a positive impact in reducing the opportunity for conflict diamonds \nto play a role in fuelling armed conflict and helps to protect legitimate trade and ensure \nthe effective implementation of the relevant resolutions on trade in conflict diamonds,  \n \nAcknowledging that lessons learned from the Peacebuilding Commission may \nbe useful for some Kimberley Process participants and that some Kimberley Process \nparticipants may also have experiences to share with respect to peacebuilding, as \nappropriate,  \n \nRecognizing that the ongoing and regular review and reform of the Kimberley \nProcess is necessary to keep pace with and aim to address the ongoing threat of \ninstability, conflict and contemporary challenges in the diamond trade in order for the \nKimberley Process to continue to fulfil its mandate in the regulation of the trade of \nrough diamonds and the prevention of conflicts,  \n \nWelcoming the decision of the 59 Kimberley Process participants, representing \n85 countries, including the 27 States members of the European Union represented by \nthe European Commission, to address the problem of conflict diamonds by \nparticipating in the Kimberley Process and implementing

to, and \nwelcoming the implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme in \nsuch a way as not to impede the legitimate trade in diamonds or impose an undue \nburden on Governments or industry, particularly smaller producers, and not to hinder \nthe development of the diamond industry,  \n \nRecognizing also that the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which came \ninto effect on 1 January 2003, will be credible only if all participants have the \nrequisite national legislation coupled with effective and credible internal systems of \ncontrol designed to eliminate the presence of conflict diamonds in the chain of \nproducing, exporting and importing rough diamonds within their own territories and \nacross their borders, while taking into account that differences in production methods \nand trading practices, as well as differences in the institutional controls thereof, may \nrequire different approaches to meeting minimum standards, and encouraging all \nparticipants to work towards overall compliance with the Kimberley Process standards,  \n \nWelcoming the voluntary system of industry self-regulation through the System \nof Warranties, in
