I, \nresolution 1. \n\nA/RES/79/86 \nInternational Year of Asteroid Awareness and Planetary Defence, 2029\n \n24-23531\n2/3 \n \nprediction, while at the same time giving consideration to developing a common \nstrategy that would include future activities related to near-Earth objects, \n \nNoting the establishment, in response to a recommendation of the Third United \nNations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, 3 of the \nAction Team on Near-Earth Objects of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer \nSpace, and of the Working Group on Near-Earth Objects of the Scientific and \nTechnical Subcommittee, to consider international procedures for handling the near-\nEarth object impact hazard and to engage international stakeholders,  \n \nRecalling its resolution 68/75 of 11 December 2013, in which it welcomed with \nsatisfaction the recommendations of the Working Group on Near-Earth Objects for an \ninternational response to the near-Earth object impact threat, which were endorsed by \nthe Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its fiftieth session and by the Committee \nat its fifty-sixth session,4 \n \nRecognizing the importance of information-sharing in discovering, monitoring \nand physically characterizing potentially hazardous near-Earth objects to ensure that \nall countries, in particular developing countries with limited capacity in predicting \nand mitigating a near-Earth object impact, are aware of potential threats, and \nemphasizing the need for capacity-building for effective emergency response and \ndisaster management in the event of a near-Earth object impact, \n \nRecalling its resolutions 70/82 of 9 December 2015 and 71/90 of 6 December \n2016, in which it noted with satisfaction the establishment of and work carried out by \nthe International Asteroid Warning Network and the Space Mission Planning Advisory \nGroup to implement the recommendations for an international response to the near-\nEarth object impact threat, with the support of the Office for Outer Space Affairs, \nserving as the permanent secretariat of the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group,  \n \nNoting that near-Earth objects are asteroids and comets whose orbit brings them \ncloser than 1.3 astronomical units, or approximately 195 million kilometres, to the \nSun, \n \nNoting also that potentially hazardous objects are a subset of the population of \nnear-Earth objects with an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of less than 0.05 \nastronomical units, or approximately 7.5 million kilometres, and a size larger than \nabout 140 metres, indirectly inferred from the object\u2019s brightness,  \n \nNoting further the importance of awareness-raising with regard to asteroids and \ncomets as celestial bodies that retain clues as to the early history and formation of the \nsolar system and that could potentially pose an impact hazard to Earth, and recalling \nin this regard the proclamation, in its resolution 71/90, of 30 June as International \nAsteroid Day to observe each year at the international level the anniversary of the \nTunguska impact event over Siberia, Russian Federation, on 30 June 1908 and to raise \npublic awareness of the asteroid impact hazard, \n \nNoting that, on 13 April 2029, the asteroid 99942 Apophis will pass safely but \nin very close proximity to the Earth, at about 32,000 kilometres above the surface of \nour home planet, thus inside the geostationary orbit, not posing any threat to the Earth, \nwhich in astronomical terms constitutes an extremely close approach, making the \nasteroid visible to billions of people with the naked eye in the clear night sky, \n__________________ \n \n3  Ibid. \n \n4  Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-eighth Session, Supplement No. 20 (A/68/20), \npara. 144;
