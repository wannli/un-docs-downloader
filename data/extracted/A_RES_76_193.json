business,  \n \nReaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa \nAction Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, \nwhich is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports \nand complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with \nconcrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to \n\nA/RES/76/193 \nExternal debt sustainability and development\n \n21-19293\n2/10 \n \naddress the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels \nfor sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity,  \n \nReaffirming further the Paris Agreement,1 and encouraging all its parties to fully \nimplement the Agreement, and parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change2 that have not yet done so to deposit their instruments of ratification, \nacceptance, approval or accession, where appropriate, as soon as possible,  \n \nRecalling the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its \nImpact on Development and its outcome document,3  \n \nRecalling also the

debt transparency and effective debt \nmanagement to the efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and \nacknowledging that debt crises are costly and disruptive, including for employment \nand productive investment, and tend to be followed by cuts in public spending, \nincluding on health and education, affecting the poor and vulnerable in particular,  \n \nReaffirming that each country has primary responsibility for its own \ndevelopment, including through maintaining its own debt sustainability, and that the \nrole of national policies and development strategies, including in the area of debt \nmanagement, is central to the achievement of sustainable development, and \nrecognizing that national efforts, including to achieve development goals and to \nmaintain debt sustainability, should be complemented by supportive global \nprogrammes, measures and policies aimed at expanding the development \nopportunities of developing countries, while taking into account national conditions \nand ensuring respect for national ownership, strategies and sovereignty,  \n \nReiterating that debt sustainability depends on a confluence of many factors at \nthe international and national levels, and emphasizing that country-specific \ncircumstances and the impact of external shocks, such as volatile commodity and \nenergy prices, more intense and frequent natural disasters and international capital \nflows, should continue to be taken into account in debt sustainability analyses,  \n \nExpressing concern about the adverse impact of the continuing fragility of the \nglobal economy and the slow pace of the restoration of global growth and trade, \nincluding the impact on development, cognizant that the global economy remains in \na challenging phase, with many downside risks, including net negative capital flows \nfrom some emerging and developing economies, continued low commodity prices, \nhigh unemployment, in particular among young people, women, persons with \ndisabilities and other people in vulnerable situations, and rising private and public \nindebtedness in many developing countries, and stressing the need for continuing \nefforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances and to reform and strengthen \nthe international financial system while implementing the reforms agreed upon to date \nto attend to these challenges and to make progress towards sustaining global demand,  \n \nExpressing deep concern that global growth has remained strongly dependent \non unprecedented increases in global debt stocks in the years since

United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1771, No. 30822. \n \n3  Resolution 63/303, annex. \n \n4  See E/FFDF/2021/3. \n\nExternal debt sustainability and development \nA/RES/76/193\n \n3/10\n21-19293 \n \ninternational financial markets, including for purposes of debt refinancing, exposes a \ngrowing number of developing economies to highly sensitive and amplified reactions \nto even mildly adverse economic developments, or the perception of such, in financial \nmarkets,  \n \nUnderlining that, globally, the gross domestic product growth rate could \nincrease significantly if every country achieved gender equality, and recognizing that \nthe economic and social losses owing to a lack of progress in achieving gender \nequality and the empowerment of women and girls are significant,  \n \nRecognizing with concern that, in 2020, the external debt positions of many \ndeveloping countries had continued to deteriorate, with external debt stocks of \ndeveloping countries growing by 500 billion United States dollars in 2020 to reach a \nnew record level of 11.3 trillion dollars, that the average ratio of total external debt \nto gross domestic product rose from 29.9 per cent in 2019 to 32.5 per cent in 2020 \nand that the cost of servicing external debt obligations now amounts, on average, to \n15.8 per cent of developing countries\u2019 export earnings, the highest level since 2002, \nas stated in the report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 5  \n \nRecognizing with concern also that small island developing States saw their \nexternal debt position deteriorate in 2020, reaching new record levels of 54.7 billion \ndollars and raising the ratio of debt service costs to export revenues from 20.1 per \ncent in 2019 to 34.1 per cent in 2020,  \n \nRecognizing with concern further that total external debt stocks in middle-\nincome countries, excluding small island developing States, grew in 2020 to \n2.35 trillion dollars, or 32.2 per cent of their gross domestic product, 148.2 per cent \nof their export earnings, that the ratio of debt service to export revenues rose from \n14.9 per cent in 2019 to 17.5 per cent in 2020 and that the debt of middle-income \ncountries is not only growing at a faster pace than anticipated but is a more costly \ndebt with a shorter maturity,  \n \nRecognizing the important role, on a case-by-case basis, of debt relief, including \ndebt cancellation, as appropriate, and debt restructuring as debt crisis prevention, \nmanagement and resolution tools,  \n \nRecalling the Sendai Declaration and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \nReduction 2015\u20132030, 6  reiterating that severe natural disasters and social or \neconomic shocks can undermine a country\u2019s debt sustainability, and noting that public \ncreditors have taken steps to ease debt repayment obligations through debt \nrescheduling and debt cancellation following an earthquake or a tsunami and in the \ncontext of the Ebola crisis in West Africa, noting the debt swap initiative of the \nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Debt for Climate \nAdaptation Swap, and encouraging consideration of further debt relief steps, such as \nthe use of sovereign contingent debt instruments, where appropriate, and/or other \nmeasures for countries affected in this regard, as feasible,  \n \nExpressing deep concern that a number of countries in special situations, in \nparticular African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing \ncountries and small island developing States, as well as a growing number of middle-\nincome countries, face challenges in servicing their debt and that, in spite of \ninternational efforts, a growing number of developing countries continue to struggle \nwith high debt burdens and are classified, in accordance with the debt sustainability \nassessments, as being in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress,  \n__________________ \n \n5  See A/76/214. \n \n6  Resolution 69/283, annexes I and II. \n\nA/RES/76/193 \nExternal debt sustainability and development\n \n21-19293\n4/10 \n \n \nRecognizing with concern that, prior to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic, total external debt stocks of developing countries reached a new record of \n10 trillion dollars, and rising external debt burdens continued to absorb a growing \nshare of developing countries\u2019 resources and simultaneously the ability of developing \ncountries to self-insure against exogenous economic and non-economic shocks, and \nincreased market risk through international reserve cushions continued to weaken, \nrecognizing with concern also that there has been a deterioration in the external debt \nsustainability of economies, in particular in the most vulnerable and in middle-income \ncountries throughout the crisis, despite efforts by the Group of 20, targeted at the most \nvulnerable countries, and bilateral creditors, such as the Paris Club, and the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank to address the challenges of debt \nsustainability, and encouraging them to continue their work to mitigate the impact of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and socioeconomic crisis on debtor countries\u2019 debt \nsustainability, noting the meetings of the fourth discussion group of the Initiative on \nFinancing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond, co convened by the \nGovernments of Canada and Jamaica and the Secretary-General,  \n \nRecognizing the importance of debt sustainability for the smooth transition of \ncountries graduating from least developed country status, as well as those that have \nalready graduated,  \n \nEmphasizing that international support, in the form of official development \nassistance and a coordinated multilateral effort to provide low-cost, long-term \ndevelopment financing, as well as enhanced domestic resource mobilization, which is \nthe primary source of financing for development across all country classifications, are \nneeded to address the growing challenges to developing countries\u2019 debt sustainability,  \n \nTaking note of the operational guidelines for sustainable financing promoted by \nthe Group of 20, while urging the Group to continue to engage in an inclusive and \ntransparent manner with other States Members of the United Nations in its work, in \norder to ensure that the initiatives of the Group complement or strengthen the United \nNations system, and noting the progress achieved in the implementation of the \noperational guidelines,  \n \nNoting the need for coordinated efforts by the International Monetary Fund and \nthe World Bank to promote responsible, transparent and sustainable lending and \nborrowing, including debt transparency,  \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety and \nwell-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the \nsevere disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives and \nlivelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the \npandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals by designing and implementing sustainable and inclusive recovery \nstrategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda \nfor Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build resilience to \nfuture shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health systems and \nachieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and timely access \nfor all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and \ndiagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, solidarity, renewed \nmultilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one behind,  \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment;  \n \n2. \nEmphasizes the special importance of timely, effective, comprehensive \nand durable solutions to the debt problems of developing countries to promote their \neconomic growth and development;  \n\nExternal debt sustainability and development \nA/RES/76/193\n \n5/10\n21-19293 \n \n \n3. \nRecognizes the importance, in particular, of new and emerging challenges \nand vulnerabilities in regard to developing country external debt sustainability arising \nfrom structural changes to overall debt composition, the rapid growth of private sector \ndebt in many emerging and developing countries and the growing use of new debt \nfinancing instruments and approaches;  \n \n4. \nNotes the growing concerns about fast-rising corporate debt, high-risk \nexposure to volatile international financial markets and fast-growing debt servicing \nburdens as potential triggers of financial and debt crises and the consequent need for \ncoordinated policy responses;  \n \n5. \nStresses the need to continue to assist developing countries in avoiding a \nbuild-up of unsustainable debt so as to reduce the risk of relapsing into another debt \ncrisis, taking into account the challenges posed by the global economic environment \nand risks for debt sustainability in some developed and developing countries;  \n \n6. \nAcknowledges the role played by the Debt Sustainability Framework for \nLow-Income Countries, jointly developed by the International Monetary Fund and the \nWorld Bank, to guide borrowing and lending decisions, and notes its operationalization \nin 2018 and the further enhancement of debt sustainability assessment frameworks, \nconsistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 7  and longer-term \nstructural transformation;  \n \n7. \nReiterates that no single indicator should be used to make definitive \njudgments about a country\u2019s debt sustainability, and, in view of the new challenges \nand vulnerabilities for developing countries\u2019 external debt sustainability, substantiated \nby the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and recent \njoint analyses of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, stresses the \nneed for improved data collection and quality in areas that include domestic public \ndebt and domestic and external private debt, as well as legal and regulatory features, \nsuch as ownership, currency denomination and jurisdiction according to national \npriorities;  \n \n8. \nAlso reiterates that timely and comprehensive data on the level and \ncomposition of debt are necessary for, inter alia, building early warning systems \naimed at limiting the impact of debt crises, calls for debtor and creditor countries to \nintensify their efforts to collect and release data, where appropriate, welcomes the \nongoing work of relevant institutions to apply innovative tools for monitoring \nfinancial stress in developing countries and to create a central data registry that \nincludes information on debt restructuring, and calls for donors to consider increasing \ntheir support for technical cooperation programmes aimed at increasing the statistical \ncapacity of developing countries in that regard;  \n \n9. \nEncourages the United Nations system, the World Bank Group, the \nInternational Monetary Fund and other relevant stakeholders, including the \nDevelopment Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development, to continue to conduct analytical activities and to provide policy \nadvice and technical assistance to Governments, upon request, in the areas of \nmanaging debt, and operating and maintaining databases, and in this regard recalls \nthat the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development should continue its \nanalytical and policy work and technical assistance on debt issues, including the Debt \nManagement and Financial Analysis System Programme, so that this extends not only \nto improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of debt data recording, but also to the \nenhanced coverage of public sector and other relevant debt data, including, in \n__________________ \n \n7  Resolution 70/1. \n\nA/RES/76/193 \nExternal debt sustainability and development\n \n21-19293\n6/10 \n \nparticular, heretofore unrecorded or hidden debt instruments, contingent liabilities \nand more complex debt instruments;  \n \n10. Stresses the need to strengthen information-sharing and transparency \namong all creditors and borrowers to make sure that debt sustainability assessments \nare based on comprehensive, objective and reliable data, including an assessment of \nnational public and private debt, in order to ensure the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, encourages further improvement of the mutual exchange of \ninformation, on a voluntary basis, on borrowing and lending among all creditors and \nborrowers, and takes note of the Paris Forum initiative, which is aimed at gathering \ntogether sovereign creditors and debtors to share views and information, promote \ngreater debt transparency and preserve debt sustainability;  \n \n11. \nRecognizes that the long-term sustainability of debt depends on, inter alia, \neconomic growth, the mobilization of domestic and international resources, the export \nprospects of debtor countries, sustainable debt management, sound macroeconomic \npolicies that also support job creation, transparent and effective regulatory \nframeworks and success in overcoming structural development problems and, hence, \non the creation of an enabling environment at all levels that is conducive to \ndevelopment, and also recognizes the need to assist developing countries in attaining \nlong-term debt sustainability, through coordinated policies aimed at fostering \nadequate debt financing and resolution tools, such as debt relief and debt restructuring \nsupporting sound debt management;  \n \n12. Notes with concern that some low- and middle-income developing \ncountries that were not part of the existing debt relief initiatives now have large debt \nburdens that may create constraints on mobilizing the resources needed to achieve the \nSustainable Development Goals, indicating a need to consider, as appropriate, \nstronger debt management initiatives for those countries, and stresses the importance \nof medium- and long-term debt sustainability to deal with debt, including bilateral \nand non-Paris Club debt;  \n \n13. \nUnderlines the fact that heavily indebted poor countries eligible for debt \nrelief will not be able to enjoy the full benefits unless all creditors, both public and \nprivate, contribute to debt workouts, as appropriate, in order to ensure the debt \nsustainability of those countries, and invites creditors, both private and public, that are \nnot yet fully participating in debt relief initiatives to substantially increase their \nparticipation, including by providing comparable treatment, to the extent possible, to \ndebtor countries that have concluded sustainable debt relief agreements with creditors; \n \n14. Stresses the need for the international community to remain vigilant in \nmonitoring the debt situation of developing countries, including the least developed \ncountries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, and to \ncontinue to take effective measures, preferably within existing frameworks, when \napplicable, to address the debt problem of those countries, acknowledges that sound \ndebt management initiatives can play a key role in liberating resources that should be \ndirected towards activities consistent with the eradication of poverty in all its forms \nand dimensions, including extreme poverty, and with the promotion of sustained \neconomic growth and development and the internationally agreed development goals, \nincluding the Sustainable Development Goals, and in this regard urges countries to \ndirect the resources freed through debt relief, in particular through debt cancellation \nand reduction, towards achieving those objectives, including in the context of the \n2030 Agenda, according to their national priorities and strategies;  \n \n15. Notes that countries can seek to negotiate, as a last resort, on a case-by-\ncase basis and through existing frameworks, agreements on temporary debt standstills \n\nExternal debt sustainability and development \nA/RES/76/193\n \n7/10\n21-19293 \n \nbetween debtors and creditors in order to help to mitigate the adverse impacts of a \ndebt crisis and stabilize macroeconomic developments;  \n \n16. Acknowledges the efforts of, and invites creditors to provide additional \nflexibility to, developing countries affected by natural disasters so as to allow them \nto address their national debt concerns, while taking into account their specific \neconomic and social situations and needs;  \n \n17. Recognizes that the detrimental impact of disasters on the debt \nsustainability of many least developed countries, small island developing States and \nmiddle-income countries warrants further attention and that preserving external debt \nsustainability requires ex ante financing to enable the systematic reduction of disaster \nrisk and resilience-building, as well as the disclosure of disaster risk to avoid \nexacerbating debt distress, when feasible, and in this regard recognizes that many \nleast developed countries, small island developing States and middle-income \ncountries have limited access to financing to invest in disaster risk reduction for \nresilience before and after disasters;  \n \n18. Also recognizes that, in some cases, the use of public debt and renewed \nexternal borrowing to absorb the impact of a natural disaster could lead to higher debt \nservicing for developing countries and constrain their growth and their capacity to \ninvest in long-term resilience-building measures, and further acknowledges that, with \neach new disaster, financial vulnerabilities grow and domestic response capacities \nweaken;  \n \n19. Further recognizes the importance of the creation of robust, nationally \nappropriate legal and regulatory frameworks for sustainable national and municipal \nborrowing, on the basis of sustainable debt management, supported by adequate \nrevenues and capacities, by means of local creditworthiness, as well as expanded \nsustainable municipal debt markets, when appropriate, and in this regard underlines \nthe importance of the establishment of appropriate financial intermediaries for urban \nfinancing, such as regional, national, subnational and local development funds or \ndevelopment banks, including pooled financing mechanisms, which can catalyse \npublic and private, national and international financing;  \n \n20. Underlines the importance of multilateral efforts to tackle increasingly \ncomplex cross-border challenges that have serious effects on development and debt \nsustainability;  \n \n21. Recognizes with appreciation the steps taken by the Group of 20, including \nthe extraordinary leaders\u2019 summit hosted by Saudi Arabia on COVID-19 and the work \nunder the presidency of Italy, to provide a time-bound suspension of debt service \npayments for the poorest countries and to implement the Debt Service Suspension \nInitiative and the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the Debt Service \nSuspension Initiative, calls for all official bilateral creditors to implement these \ninitiatives fully and in a transparent, timely and effective manner, while noting that \nmore needs to be done, including to respond to the needs of countries not covered by \nthese initiatives, including middle-income countries, and in this regard reaffirms the \ngrowing urgency of dealing not only with liquidity but also solvency risks, and \n(a) welcomes the International Monetary Fund\u2019s special drawing rights allocation of \nthe equivalent of 650 billion dollars of 23 August 2021 to meet the long-term global \nneed to supplement reserve assets, and encourages countries with strong external \npositions to seek options for voluntary channelling of special drawing rights, in \naccordance with national laws and regulations, and to this end appreciates the Fund\u2019s \nefforts to seek further viable options for the voluntary channelling of special drawing \nrights to countries most in need, such as the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust and \nthe new Resilience and Sustainability Trust of the Fund, with a view to providing \n\nA/RES/76/193 \nExternal debt sustainability and development\n \n21-19293\n8/10 \n \naffordable long-term financing to developing countries in a manner that preserves \ntheir external debt sustainability, and encourages the consideration of viable options \nto voluntarily channel through multilateral development banks; (b) recommends \nassisting developing countries in attaining long-term debt sustainability through \ncoordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief, debt restructuring \nand sound debt management, as appropriate, to enhance the ability of countries to \nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals; and (c) also recommends the facilitation \nof timely and orderly debt treatment with the broad participation of all creditors, \nincluding those in the private sector, on comparable terms, stresses the need in the \nmedium term to strengthen information-sharing between debtors and creditors, as \nnecessary, and long-term debt sustainability analysis, based on comprehensive, \nobjective, transparent and reliable data, while respecting commercially sensitive \ninformation, and technical cooperation that takes account of the requirements of \nsustainable development and the 2030 Agenda, and emphasizes the urgency of \nstrengthening international efforts and cooperation and responding to the call for the \neasing of debt burdens by addressing the debt vulnerability, in the immediate term, \nand the debt sustainability, in the long term, of highly indebted developing countries; \n \n22. Recognizes the role of the United Nations and of the international financial \ninstitutions, in accordance with their respective mandates, and encourages them to \ncontinue to support global efforts towards sustained and inclusive growth, sustainable \ndevelopment and the external debt sustainability of developing countries, including \nthrough continued monitoring of global financial flows and their implications in this \nregard;  \n \n23. \nReiterates that debtors and creditors must work together in a transparent \nmanner to prevent and resolve unsustainable debt situations and that maintaining \nsustainable debt levels is the responsibility of the borrowing countries, acknowledges \nthat lenders also have a responsibility to lend in a way that does not undermine a \ncountry\u2019s debt sustainability, and in this regard takes note of the principles on \nresponsible sovereign lending and borrowing of the United Nations Conference on \nTrade and Development, recognizes the applicable requirements of the debt limits \npolicy of the International Monetary Fund and/or the non-concessional borrowing \npolicy of the World Bank and the safeguards of the Development Assistance Committee \nof the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in its statistical \nsystem to enhance the debt sustainability of recipient countries, and resolves to work \ntowards a global consensus on guidelines for debtor and creditor responsibilities in \nborrowing by and lending to sovereigns, building on existing initiatives;  \n \n24. Calls for the intensification of efforts to prevent and mitigate the \nprevalence and cost of debt crises by enhancing international financial mechanisms \nfor crisis prevention and resolution, encourages the private sector to cooperate in this \nregard, and invites creditors and debtors to further explore, where appropriate and on \na mutually agreed, transparent and case-by-case basis, the use of new and improved \ndebt instruments such as debt swaps, including debt for equity in Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal projects, as well as debt indexation instruments;  \n \n25. Notes with appreciation the holding of the fifteenth session of the United \nNations Conference on Trade and Development in Barbados and Geneva from 3 to \n7 October 2021, and the Bridgetown Covenant, and encourages the United Nations \nConference on Trade and Development, in cooperation with the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund, to continue its analytical and policy work and technical \nassistance on debt issues, including to promote policies for responsible, sustainable \nand transparent sovereign borrowing and lending, as appropriate, and to enhance the \nefficiency of the global economic system and debt sustainability for the realization of \nthe 2030 Agenda in developing countries;  \n\nExternal debt sustainability and development \nA/RES/76/193\n \n9/10\n21-19293 \n \n \n26. Expresses its concern regarding the ability of non-cooperative minority \nbondholders to disrupt the will of the large majority of bondholders who accept a \nrestructuring of a debt-crisis country\u2019s obligations, given the potential broader \nimplications in other countries, notes legislative steps taken by certain countries to \nprevent these activities and encourage all Governments to take action, as appropriate, \nand, furthermore, takes note of discussions in the United Nations on debt issues;  \n \n27. Encourages Governments to be mindful of the ability of non-cooperative \nminority bondholders to block a restructuring of a debt-crisis country\u2019s obligations, \nand encourages debtors and creditors to work together to draft bond agreements \naccordingly;  \n \n28. Welcomes the reforms to pari passu and collective action clauses proposed \nby the International Capital Market Association and endorsed by the International \nMonetary Fund to reduce the vulnerability of sovereigns to holdout creditors, \nencourages countries to take further action to include those clauses in all their bond \nissuances, and welcomes the continued work of the International Monetary Fund to \nmonitor the uptake of the clauses and explore options for resolving the issue with the \noutstanding stock of debt without such clauses;  \n \n29. Recalls that the United Nations, as a universal intergovernmental body, \nhas provided a platform for both creditors and debtors to discuss ways to improve \nexternal debt sustainability, notes the substantive expert debate among the major \ninstitutional stakeholders on how to improve debt sustainability and debt restructuring \nduring the 2021 Economic and Social Council forum on financing for development \nfollow-up, and in this regard invites continued ongoing cooperation among the \ninternational financial institutions, including the Bretton Woods institutions, in \nparticular the International Monetary Fund, relevant United Nations system entities, \nincluding the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and other \nrelevant forums, in accordance with their respective mandates, pursuant to the \nrelevant resolutions on this matter;  \n \n30. Also recalls the establishment of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts \non Financing for Development of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment, notes its fourth session, held in January 2021, at which systemic issues \nin the current global economy, including the issue of debt sustainability, were items \nfor deliberation, and recalls the request that the work of the Intergovernmental Group \nof Experts on Financing for Development at the United Nations Conference on Trade \nand Development be presented as a regular input to the Economic and Social Council \nforum on financing for development follow-up, in accordance with the terms of \nreference of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts;  \n \n31.
