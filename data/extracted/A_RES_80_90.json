the options \nfor self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, \nsize of population or natural resources, \n \nConvinced that the wishes and aspirations of the

the administering Powers that \nare contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution \n1514 (XV), \n \nConvinced that any negotiations to determine the status of

self-\ndetermination and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-\ndetermination, on a case-by-case basis, \n \nMindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the \nCaribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of \nrepresentatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for \nthe Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the \nseminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element \nin the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of \nthe Territories, \n \nWelcoming the Pacific regional seminar on the theme \u201cPathways to a sustainable \nfuture \u2013 advancing socioeconomic and cultural development of the Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories\u201d, held by the Special Committee in Dili, and hosted by the \nGovernment of Timor-Leste from 21 to 23 May 2025, as a significant and

in which he expressed \nhis view that the people of American Samoa were happy with the relationship with \nthe administering Power, which could be described as strong and healthy as well as \nbeneficial to the people and the Government of the Territory, and that the most \nimportant benefit to American Samoa had been the protection of its Indigenous rights \nto the land as provided for in the Deeds of Cession, \n \nRecalling further the statement made by the representative that the political \nstatus of American Samoa as an unincorporated and unorganized territory of the \nadministering Power limited its ability to self-government and exposed it to decisions \nmade by the administering Power, \n \nRecalling the statement by the representative that, while certain aspects of the \nform of government of the Territory and its relationship with the administering Power \nwere challenging and in need of improvement, the solutions could be found within \nthe confines of the political and judicial systems of the administering Power and that \nthe territorial Government was pursuing legal actions to counteract the impact of \nunfavourable federal actions and sought
