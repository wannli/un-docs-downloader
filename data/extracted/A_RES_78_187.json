mechanisms and safeguards for the rights of all \naffected children, and recognizing the need to foster a policy of zero tolerance for all \nforms of violence against children, \n \nDeeply concerned that children disproportionately suffer the consequences of \ndiscrimination, exclusion and inequality and that the situation of children in many parts \nof the world remains negatively affected by the prolonged effects of poverty and \ninequality, reaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is one \nof the greatest global challenges and an indispensable requirement for sustainable \ndevelopment, recognizing the impact of poverty beyond the socioeconomic context and \nthe intrinsic interlinkage between poverty eradication and the promotion of sustainable \ndevelopment, and in this regard underlining the importance of the implementation of \nthe 2030 Agenda and recognizing that a strong focus is needed on poverty, deprivation \nand inequality to

\nExpressing concern about the spread of disinformation and misinformation, \nincluding among children, particularly on social media platforms, which can be \ndesigned and implemented so as to

\nRecognizing that the empowerment of and investment in children, and in \nparticular girls, which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of the \nSustainable Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme \npoverty, are key in breaking the cycle of all forms of discrimination and violence, \nincluding multiple and intersecting forms, and in promoting, respecting and \nprotecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing \nfurther that empowering children requires their active and meaningful participation \nin decision-making processes in accordance with their evolving capacities or age and \nmaturity and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, while \nacknowledging that all parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and \ndevelopment of the child, with the best interests of the child as their basic concern, \n \nExpressing serious concern that children with disabilities,
