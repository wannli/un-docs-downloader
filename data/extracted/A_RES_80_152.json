A. \n\nContribution of the care economy to sustainable development \nA/RES/80/152\n \n3/4\n25-20785 \n \n \nAcknowledging that care work spans diverse occupations and sectors, both \nformal and informal, such as, inter alia, the activities of workers in education, early \nchildhood care and education, care for older persons and the health and social sectors, \nand of individuals who perform unpaid care work, and that care work consists of, \namong others, activities and relations that pursue sustainability and quality of life, \nnurture human capabilities, foster agency, autonomy and dignity, develop the \nopportunities and resilience of those who provide and receive care, address the diverse \nneeds of individuals across different life stages, and meet the physical, psychological, \ncognitive, mental health and developmental needs for care and support of people, \nincluding children, adolescents, youth, adults, older persons, persons with disabilities \nand all caregivers, while further acknowledging that there is currently no \ninternationally agreed statistical definition of care work, \n \nRecognizing that the care economy contributes substantially to national income, \nemployment creation, human capabilities and productivity, and noting that unpaid \ncare and domestic work is estimated to be between 10 and 39 per cent of gross \ndomestic product, if valued at the hourly minimum wage, and can surpass that of \nmanufacturing, commerce, transportation and other key productive sectors, \nunderscoring its macroeconomic relevance, \n \nRecognizing also that investing in the care economy yields substantial \nmacroeconomic and social returns, and that such investments, according to \nInternational Labour Organization estimates, could generate nearly 300 million jobs \nglobally by 2035, raise global employment rates by more than six percentage points \nand reduce the gender employment gap by around seven percentage points, and that \nevery United States dollar invested in closing childcare gaps could yield an average \nincrease of 3.76 dollars in gross domestic product by 2035, while acknowledging that \nthese estimates may vary across national contexts and policy designs, \n \nNoting with concern that women and girls, including adolescent girls and older \nwomen, and especially women and girls living in poverty, undertake a \ndisproportionate share of unpaid care work, which exacerbates gender inequality by \nlimiting women\u2019s agency to decide how to spend their time and their ability to \nparticipate in the labour market and decision-making processes, that it poses \nsignificant constraints on women\u2019s and girls\u2019 education and training, and that this kind \nof entrenched inequality and social exclusion is an obstacle to broad-based and \nsustained growth, \n \nNoting that women often make up a large portion of the paid care workforce, \nincluding in informal employment, self-employment and part-time or temporary work \nand as migrant workers, while continuing to bear most of the responsibility for unpaid \ncare and support work and having fewer continuous paid work years than men, which \nlimits their ability to accumulate lifetime savings and benefit from pension and social \nsecurity schemes, and noting also that these inequalities contribute to the feminization \nof poverty and that comprehensive care and support systems, which include legal and \npolicy frameworks, services, financing, social and physical infrastructure, \nprogrammes, human capital development, standards and training, governance and \nadministration, are key to reducing women\u2019s economic vulnerability and preventing \nthe intergenerational transmission of poverty, and that mechanisms to build social \nprotection that value and account for periods of unpaid work over their life course can \nhelp to address this situation, \n \nAcknowledging the need to adopt measures to recognize unpaid and paid care \nwork and reduce, redistribute and value unpaid care work by promoting the equal \nsharing of responsibilities between women and men, within the household and by \nprioritizing, inter alia, sustainable infrastructure, social protection policies and \naccessible, affordable and quality care and support services, adequate paid maternity, \n\nA/RES/80/152 \nContribution of the care economy to sustainable development\n \n25-20785\n4/4 \n \npaternity and parental leave, as well as protection from discrimination on the grounds \nof maternity in the labour market, and targeted adequate working arrangements, \n \nRecognizing that the design and implementation of care and support systems \nmust take into account existing economic, social and institutional capacities, that \nmany developing countries face limited fiscal space, infrastructure deficits and high \nlevels of informality, and that international cooperation, official development \nassistance, debt relief and concessional financing are important to support \ninvestments in care infrastructure and services, \n \n1. \nInvites Member States, taking into account national circumstances, plans \nand priorities, to consider: \n \n(a) \nIntegrating the value of the care economy, particularly unpaid care work, \ninto national policies and planning, including, inter alia, national account systems, \nbudgeting processes, fiscal and monetary policy, national statistics and development \nplans; \n \n(b) \nAdopting comprehensive and intergenerational approaches in the design \nand implementation of care and support systems, taking the care economy into \naccount in economic and social policymaking; \n \n(c) \nCollecting quantitative and qualitative disaggregated data and statistics on \ncare work, including through time-use and labour-force surveys, to better measure the \nfull extent of paid and unpaid care work and to inform evidence-based policymaking; \n \n2. \nEncourages Member States, in accordance with their national priorities \nand capacities, to increase investment in the care economy, including by promoting \nstrategic investments in care infrastructure and services that can support the creation \nof decent work, enable greater female labour-force participation and improve well-\nbeing and human development outcomes; \n \n3. \nInvites the relevant entities of the United Nations development system, as \nappropriate and within their existing mandates and resources, to support programme \ncountries\u2019 efforts, upon request and in line with national priorities, needs and plans, \nto develop, strengthen and expand care and support systems and related efforts in the \ncare economy, including through the provision of technical assistance, capacity-\nbuilding and policy advice; \n \n4. \nCalls upon the international community, including, inter alia, development \npartners, international financial institutions, multilateral and public development \nbanks and the private sector, to consider how to support national efforts to invest in \nand strengthen care and support systems, including through official development \nassistance, concessional finance, technical assistance, capacity-building, technology \ntransfer on mutually agreed terms and knowledge-sharing; \n \n5. \nRequests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its
