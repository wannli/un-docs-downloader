Chile, Comoros, Egypt, Ireland, Kiribati, Mexico, New Zealand, \nNigeria, San Marino, South Africa and Thailand: draft resolution  \n \n \n \n Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: accelerating the \nimplementation of nuclear disarmament commitments \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nRecalling its resolution 1 (I) of 24 January 1946 and resolution 79/35 of \n2 December 2024,  \n \nRecalling also the report of the Secretary-General entitled \u201cOur Common \nAgenda\u201d,1 in particular the reiteration by the Secretary-General of the commitment to \nachieve a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and \nthe disarmament recommendations of policy brief 9, entitled \u201cA New Agenda for \nPeace\u201d, 2  presented by the Secretary-General on 20 July 2023, in particular the \nrecognition that the existential threat that nuclear weapons pose to humanity must \nmotivate us to work towards their total elimination and the recommendation to States \nto recommit urgently to the pursuit of a world free of nuclear weapons and reverse \nthe erosion of international norms against the spread and use of nuclear weapons, and \nrecalling further the importance of the Secretary-General\u2019s disarmament agenda, \nSecuring Our Common Future: An Agenda for Disarmament,  \n \nRecalling further the Pact for the Future,3 namely actions 25 and 26, in which \nMember States recommit to the goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons and \nseek to accelerate the full and effective implementation of respective nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation obligations and commitments,  \n \nDeeply concerned about the continued global peace and security challenges \ncurrently taking hold and the increased prominence being given by some States to \nnuclear weapons in their security doctrines, the expansion of nuclear stockpiles, \nnational plans by the nuclear-weapon States to expand, modernize and qualitatively \nimprove nuclear arsenals, the disregard of negative security assurances, as well as plans \nby the nuclear-weapon States and States under extended nuclear security guarantees to \n__________________ \n \n1  A/75/982.

placement of nuclear weapons on the territory of non-nuclear-weapon \nStates, all of which contribute to the erosion of the disarmament and non-proliferation \nregime and undermine the achievement of a nuclear-weapon free world,  \n \nAlarmed that recent international tensions have taken an increasing nuclear \ndimension, particularly with regard to threats to use nuclear weapons and increasingly \nstrident nuclear rhetoric,  \n \nDeeply concerned about continuous actions that weaken the disarmament and \nnon-proliferation architecture and undermine key norms, such as the dismantling of \ncore agreements among the nuclear-weapon States, including the Intermediate-Range \nNuclear Forces Treaty, the Treaty on Open Skies, and the suspension of the Treaty on \nMeasures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (New \nSTART Treaty), the only remaining bilateral arms control agreement between the \nUnited States of America and the Russian Federation, which is set to expire on \n5 February 2026, and encouraging both Parties to ensure its full and effective \nimplementation, to ensure also that current limits are not abandoned, and to urgently \nput in place arrangements for successor agreements,  \n \nEmphasizing the urgent need for concrete measures to lower the risk of nuclear \nweapons use and to contribute to the prevention of nuclear war, including the \nreduction of the role of nuclear weapons in security doctrines, policies and plans, \nwhile underscoring that completely removing the risks associated with nuclear \nweapons requires their total, irreversible and verifiable elimination,  \n \nConcerned about unpredictable new strategic factors involving developments in \nthe fields of outer space, artificial intelligence and cyberspace, which have the \npotential to increase the risk of use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, \n \nConcerned also by extended nuclear deterrence arrangements that include the \nforward deployment of nuclear weapons, including on the territory of non-nuclear-weapon \nStates, which, inter alia, reduce response times and hasten nuclear decision-making, \n \nRecalling the joint statement on preventing nuclear war and avoiding arms races \nissued by China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain \nand Northern Ireland and the United States of America on 3 January 2022, affirming \nthat \u201ca nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought\u201d, and the statement by \nthe New Agenda Coalition issued on 25 January 2022, 4 calling for the five nuclear-\nweapon States to pursue tangible steps towards the total elimination of their nuclear \narsenals in accordance with their obligations under article VI of the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,5 \n \nRecalling also the decisions and the resolution adopted at the 1995 Review and \nExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the

consequences and \ninherent risks of nuclear weapons in multilateral disarmament forums since 2010, \nincluding in the Conferences on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, the \nmost recent of which was held in Vienna on 20 June 2022,  \n \nRecognizing the highly disproportionate and gendered impact of exposure to \nionizing radiation for women and girls, and the need to further integrate a gender \nperspective into all aspects of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation decision-\nmaking processes, inter alia by including the commitment to ensure the equal, full and \neffective participation and leadership of both women and men, including in the \nimplementation and review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,  \n \nUnderscoring the important contribution made by nuclear-weapon-free zones to \nenhancing international peace and security, to a strengthened nuclear non-proliferation \nregime and as a practical contribution towards nuclear disarmament,  \n \nUrging States to strengthen all existing nuclear-weapon-free zones, inter alia, \nthrough the ratification of existing treaties and relevant protocols and the withdrawal \nor revision of any reservations or interpretative declarations contrary to the object and \npurpose of the treaties establishing such zones,  \n \nRecalling the encouragement expressed at the 2010 Review Conference for the \nestablishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones, on the basis of arrangements freely \narrived at among the States of the region concerned, reaffirming the expectation that \nthis will be followed by concerted international efforts to create such zones in areas \nwhere they do not currently exist, especially in the Middle East, and in this context noting \nwith deep disappointment the non-fulfilment of the agreement at the 2010 Review \nConference on practical steps to fully implement the 1995 resolution on the Middle East,  \n \nEncouraged by the successful organization in 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 \nby the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in accordance with its decision \n73/546 of 22 December 2018, of the sessions of a conference aimed at elaborating a \ntreaty on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all \nother weapons of mass destruction, on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at by \nthe States of the region,  \n \nUnderlining the importance of multilateralism in relation to nuclear \ndisarmament, while recognizing the value of unilateral, bilateral and regional \ninitiatives and the importance of compliance with the terms of these initiatives,  \n \nRecalling the twenty-ninth anniversary of the opening for signature of the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty10 and the continued vital importance of its \nentry into force to the advancement of nuclear disarmament and nuclear \nnon-proliferation objectives, while noting the long-standing inertia towards \nratification of the Treaty by nuclear-weapon States and recent moves to withdraw \nratification, which continue to make the entry into force of the Treaty impossible, \nwith the associated risk that nuclear testing could be resumed, \n \nUnderlining that pending the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty, it is necessary to uphold and maintain the moratorium on nuclear-\nweapon-test explosions or any other nuclear explosions, \n \nWelcoming the outcomes of the first, second and third Meetings of States Parties \nto the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, held in 2022 in Vienna, 11 and in \n2023 and 2025 in New York,12 and the convening of the first Review Conference of \n__________________ \n \n10  See resolution 50/245 and A/50/1027. \n \n11  See TPNW/MSP/2022/6. \n \n12  See

to participate in these proceedings,  \n \nWelcoming also the commemoration and promotion of 26 September as the \nInternational Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, as established by \nresolution 68/32 of 5 December 2013,  \n \nDeeply disappointed at the continued absence of progress towards multilateral \nnuclear disarmament, including the persistent failure to undertake new negotiations \nat the Conference on Disarmament, which has been unable to agree upon and \nimplement a programme of work since 1996, representing a failure to deliver on its \nmandate for almost three decades, and that the Disarmament Commission has not \nproduced a substantive outcome on nuclear disarmament since 1999, while recalling \nthe limitations of its solely deliberative function, \n \nUnderscoring the need to develop legally binding verification arrangements to \nsupport nuclear disarmament, in accordance with the principles of irreversibility, \nverification and transparency, that would provide the necessary confidence in the total \nelimination of nuclear weapons,  \n \n1. \nCondemns unequivocally all nuclear threats, whether explicit or implicit, \nand irrespective of the circumstances, and calls upon all States, in particular the nuclear-\nweapon States, to reject any normalization of nuclear rhetoric and, in particular, the \nthreat of use of nuclear weapons, which only serves to undermine the disarmament and \nnon-proliferation regime and is against the Charter of the United Nations;  \n \n2. \nStresses the fundamental role of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons in achieving nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, \nand looks forward to achieving substantive progress during the 2026 Review \nConference, in order to strengthen the Treaty and its review process, overcoming the \nobstacles that prevented a substantive outcome in the two previous Review \nConferences held in 2015 and 2022; \n \n3. \nReiterates that each article of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons is binding on the respective States Parties at all times and in all \ncircumstances and that all States

\ncommitments as agreed to at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences of the \nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and calls upon all \nStates Parties, and in particular the nuclear-weapon States, to reaffirm and implement \nthose decisions, resolutions and commitments;  \n \n5. \nStrongly urges nuclear-weapon States to implement the unequivocal \nundertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to \nnuclear disarmament, as agreed at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and as a means to ensure full \nimplementation of article VI of the Treaty; \n \n6. \nUrges all State Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons to implement their article VI obligations and to pursue multilateral \nnegotiations without delay on effective measures for the achievement and \nmaintenance of a nuclear-weapon-free world, recalling in particular the commitment \nof the nuclear-weapon States to accelerating concrete progress on the steps leading to \nnuclear disarmament;  \n \n7. \nRecognizes the need for an institutional mechanism to monitor the \nimplementation of nuclear disarmament obligations; \n\nA/C.1/80/L.55 \n \n25-16789\n6/8 \n \n \n8. \nCalls upon all States to give due prominence to the humanitarian \nimperatives that underpin nuclear disarmament and to the urgency of achieving it, \nincluding new evidence presented at the Conferences on the Humanitarian Impact of \nNuclear Weapons, and those imperatives should inform all deliberations, decisions \nand actions relating to nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, including \nwithin the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons;  \n \n9. \nUrges the nuclear-weapon States to make concrete reductions in the role \nand significance of nuclear weapons in all military and security concepts, doctrines \nand policies, pending their total elimination as agreed by the Parties to the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the outcome documents of the 2000 and \n2010 Review Conferences, and calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to include such \ninformation in their regular reporting details regarding progress towards this end;  \n \n10. Calls upon other States Parties to the Treaty that maintain a role for nuclear \nweapons in their military and security concepts, doctrines and policies to provide \nstandardized information at regular intervals on, inter alia, measures taken to reduce \nthe role and significance of nuclear weapons in military and security concepts, \ndoctrines and policies, the number, type (strategic or non-strategic) and status \n(deployed or non-deployed, and alert status) of nuclear warheads within their \nterritories, where applicable, and the number and type of delivery vehicles within \ntheir territories, where applicable;  \n \n11. \nCalls upon nuclear-weapon States to halt the quantitative increases and \nqualitative improvement of their nuclear arsenals and the development of advanced \nnew types of nuclear weapons, and their means of delivery, including those that \nincrease the risk of escalation; \n \n12. Urges all nuclear-weapon States to immediately lower the operational \nreadiness of nuclear-weapon systems in a verifiable and transparent manner with a \nview to ensuring that all nuclear weapons are removed from high alert status;  \n \n13. Encourages all States that are part of regional alliances that include \nnuclear-weapon States to diminish the role of nuclear weapons in their collective \nsecurity doctrines, pending their total elimination;  \n \n14. \nEncourages nuclear-weapon States to apply the agreed interrelated \nprinciples of transparency, verifiability and irreversibility in the implementation of their \nobligations and undertakings, including those agreed by the States Parties to the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons at its 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review \nConferences, taking into account that they are strongly interrelated and are not an end \nin themselves and are not a prerequisite to commence nuclear disarmament;  \n \n15. \nStresses the necessity for enhanced transparency by the nuclear-weapon \nStates with regard to their nuclear weapons capabilities and the implementation of their \narticle VI obligations and nuclear disarmament-related commitments, and urges nuclear-\nweapon States to implement their nuclear disarmament obligations and commitments, \nboth qualitative and quantitative, in a manner that strengthens accountability and \nenables all States Parties to regularly monitor progress, including through a standard \ndetailed reporting format, thereby enhancing transparency and increasing mutual \nconfidence, and facilitating the evidence-based evaluation of progress towards the full \nimplementation of article VI and nuclear disarmament commitments;  \n \n16. Urges the nuclear-weapon States to voluntarily present, jointly or \nindividually, implementation plans for the commitments and undertakings agreed to \nunder the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, including time frames \nand benchmarks for progress;  \n\nA/C.1/80/L.55\n \n7/8\n25-16789 \n \n \n17. Also urges the nuclear-weapon States, pending the total elimination of \ntheir nuclear arsenals to which they have unequivocally committed, to remove all \noperational nuclear weapons from high alert status and to put in place, as a matter of \nurgency, appropriate legal and procedural safeguards aimed at reducing the risk of a \nnuclear detonation by accident, miscalculation or design; \n \n18. Further urges the nuclear-weapon States to report at least twice during a \nReview Conference cycle at appropriate intervals, and to include in their reports to \nbe submitted during the eleventh review cycle of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons concrete and detailed information concerning the implementation \nof their obligations and commitments on nuclear disarmament;  \n \n19. Encourages States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons to improve the measurability of the implementation of nuclear \ndisarmament obligations and commitments, including agreement on but not limited \nto measures on improved and more structured reporting by the nuclear-weapon States, \ntools such as a set of benchmarks and timelines and/or similar criteria, in order to \nensure and facilitate the objective evaluation of progress, as well as the establishment \nof a structured dialogue on this issue at the meetings of the Preparatory Committee \nfor the 2026 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons and at the Review Conference on these improved and more \nstructured reports, facilitated by the Chairs of the Preparatory Committee meetings, \nwho will provide a joint report to each Review Conference that includes specific \nrecommendations, targets and indicators, to improve the monitoring of and reporting \non article VI and disarmament-related commitments;  \n \n20. Encourages the nuclear-weapon States, as part of their national reporting, \nto include details on their plans related to the modernization of nuclear weapons; their \nnuclear capabilities, including quantity, type and status of nuclear warheads, as well \nas delivery vehicles; doctrinal issues; risk reduction measures; de-alerting measures; \nquantity of fissile material; and the number and type of weapons and delivery systems \nthey have disarmed;  \n \n21. Encourages further steps by all nuclear-weapon States to ensure the \nirreversible removal of all fissile material designated by each nuclear-weapon State \nas no longer required for military purposes, and calls upon all States to support, within \nthe context of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the development of \nappropriate nuclear disarmament verification capabilities and legally binding \nverification arrangements, thereby ensuring that such material remains permanently \noutside military programmes in a verifiable and irreversible manner;  \n \n22. \nCalls upon all States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons to work towards the full implementation of the resolution on the \nMiddle East adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,13 which is inextricably linked to \nthe indefinite extension of the Treaty, and which remains valid until fully implemented;  \n \n23. Urges the co-sponsors of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East to exert \ntheir utmost efforts with a view to ensuring the early establishment of a Middle East \nzone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction as contained \nin the 1995 resolution on the Middle East, including through support for the \nconvening of the conference on the establishment of such a zone;  \n__________________ \n \n13  See 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons, Final Document, Part I (NPT/CONF.1995/32 (Part I) and \nNPT/CONF.1995/32 (Part I)/Corr.2), annex. \n\nA/C.1/80/L.55 \n \n25-16789\n8/8 \n \n \n24.
