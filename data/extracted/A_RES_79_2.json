Political declaration of the high-level meeting on \nantimicrobial resistance \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly \n \nAdopts the political declaration of the high-level meeting on antimicrobial \nresistance, held on 26 September 2024 in accordance with its resolution 78/269 of \n25 March 2024, as contained in the annex to the present resolution. \n \n18th plenary meeting \n7 October 2024 \n \nAnnex \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance \n \n \nWe, Heads of State and Government and representatives of States and \nGovernments, are assembled at the United Nations on 26 September 2024, in \naccordance with General Assembly resolution 78/269 of 25 March 2024, to review \nprogress on global, regional and national efforts to tackle antimicrobial resistance, to \nidentify gaps and invest in sustainable solutions to strengthen and accelerate \nmultisectoral progress at all levels, through a One Health approach, with a view to \nscaling up the global effort to build a healthier world based on equity and leaving no \none behind, and in this regard we:  \n \n1. \nRecognize that antimicrobial resistance is one of the most urgent global \nhealth threats and development challenges and demands immediate action to \nsafeguard our ability to treat human, animal and plant diseases, as well as to enhance \nfood safety, food security and nutrition, foster economic development, equity and a \n\nA/RES/79/2 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on \nantimicrobial resistance\n \n24-18680\n2/15 \n \nhealthy environment, and advance the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment;1 \n \n2. \nReaffirm that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development offers a \nframework to ensure healthy lives, and recall commitments to fight malaria, \nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis, the Ebola virus disease, neglected tropical \ndiseases and other communicable diseases and epidemics that disproportionately \naffect developing countries, including by addressing growing antimicrobial \nresistance, while reiterating that antimicrobial resistance challenges the sustainability \nand effectiveness of the public health response to these and other diseases as well as \ngains in health and development and the attainment of the 2030 Agenda;  \n \n3. \nRecall that, within the broader context of antimicrobial resistance, \nresistance to antibiotics is a grave global challenge, and that effective, safe and \naffordable antibiotics are a prerequisite for providing quality, accessible and timely \nhealthcare services and are essential for the functioning of all health systems;  \n \n4. \nRecognize that, while antimicrobial resistance affects people of all ages, \nknows no borders and is present in all countries, the burden is largely and \ndisproportionately borne by developing countries and those in vulnerable situations, \nrequiring global solidarity, joint efforts and international cooperation;  \n \n5. \nNote with concern that lack of access to appropriate, safe, effective and \naffordable antimicrobials and diagnostic tools, particularly in developing countries, \nis responsible for more deaths than antimicrobial resistance, while stressing that, in \n2019, 4.95 million deaths were associated with drug-resistant bacterial infections, \nincluding 1.27 million deaths directly attributable to bacterial antimicrobial \nresistance, 20 per cent of whom were children under 5, 2 and that without a stronger \nresponse there will be an estimated average loss of life expectancy of 1.8 years \nglobally by 2035;3 \n \n6. \nNote with concern also that, globally, antimicrobial resistance could result \nin 1 trillion United States dollars of additional healthcare costs per year by 2050 and \n1 trillion to 3.4 trillion dollars of gross domestic product losses per year by 2030, 4 \nand that treating drug-resistant bacterial infections alone could cost up to 412 billion \ndollars annually, coupled with workforce participation and productivity losses of \n443 billion dollars,5 with antimicrobial resistance predicted to cause an 11 per cent \ndecline in livestock production in low-income countries by 2050;6 \n \n7. \nNote with serious concern the severe shortcomings the coronavirus disease \n(COVID\u201119) pandemic has revealed at the national, regional and global levels in \nterms of timely, effective prevention, preparedness, detection of and response to \npotential health emergencies, and consequently the challenges this creates for \neffectively tackling antimicrobial resistance, including in the capacity and resilience \nof all health systems, especially in developing countries;  \n \n8. \nReaffirm that improving infection prevention and control measures, \nvaccination and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) could prevent more than \n_______________ \n \n1 Resolution 70/1. \n \n2 \u201cGlobal burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance in 2019: a systematic analysis\u201d, The Lancet, \nvol. 399, No. 10325 (February 2022). \n \n3 Global Leaders Group on Antimicrobial Resistance, \u201cGLG report: Towards specific commitments \nand action in the response to antimicrobial resistance\u201d. \n \n4 World Bank Group, Drug-resistant Infections: A Threat to Our Economic Future \u2013 Final Report \n(Washington, D.C., March 2017). \n \n5 Quadripartite study on the economics of antimicrobial resistance. \n \n6 World Bank Group, Drug-resistant Infections: A Threat to Our Economic Future \u2013 Final Report \n(Washington, D.C., March 2017). \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on \nantimicrobial resistance \nA/RES/79/2\n \n3/15\n24-18680 \n \n750,000 deaths each year from antimicrobial resistance in low- and middle-income \ncountries alone, and that prioritizing good antimicrobial stewardship, universal health \ncoverage and equitable access to medicines, diagnostics and other health products, \ninvestment in infrastructure, and education, including public awareness campaigns \nand training, will further serve to prevent all infections; \n \n9. \nRecognize the need to scale up multisectoral, cross-sectoral and \ninterdisciplinary efforts and the engagement of all relevant sectors to address \nantimicrobial resistance in human, animal and plant health, such as agriculture, \nenvironment, finance, manufacturing, research and development, and education to \ngenerate an effective whole-of-government and whole-of-society response, in line \nwith a One Health approach; \n \n10. Reaffirm the commitment to General Assembly resolution 71/3 of \n5 October 2016, entitled \u201cPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting of the \nGeneral Assembly on antimicrobial resistance\u201d, and note the report of the \nInter\u2011Agency \nCoordination \nGroup \non \nAntimicrobial \nResistance \nand \nits \nrecommendations to the Secretary-General of April 2019, as well as the Call to Action \non Antimicrobial Resistance \u2013 2021 of the High-level Interactive Dialogue on \nAntimicrobial Resistance;7 \n \n11. \nWelcome the organization of the 2023 high-level meetings of the General \nAssembly on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, on universal health \ncoverage and on the fight against tuberculosis and recall their political declarations, 8 \nwhich highlighted the importance of international cooperation, collaboration, equity \nand global solidarity in scaling up the global effort to leave no one behind and to build \na healthier world for all;  \n \n12. Take note of the contributions by the Ministerial Conferences on \nAntimicrobial Resistance in 2014 and 2019 in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the \nThird Global High-level Ministerial Conference on Antimicrobial Resistance in 2022 \nin Oman, during which 47 Member States endorsed the Muscat Ministerial Manifesto, \nand Member State-led efforts, such as the First BRICS International Conference on \nAntimicrobial Resistance in 2024 in the Russian Federation, and the continuous \ncommitment to have One Health and antimicrobial resistance as a priority of the \nGroup of 20 and the Group of Seven;  \n \n13. Look forward to the upcoming Fourth Global High-level Ministerial \nConference on Antimicrobial Resistance, to be held in November 2024 in Saudi \nArabia under the theme \u201cFrom Declaration to Implementation: Accelerating Actions \nthrough Multisectoral Partnerships for the Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance\u201d; \n \n14. Acknowledge the need to leave no one behind and reach the furthest \nbehind first, and to ensure equitable and timely access to quality essential healthcare \nservices and safe, effective, quality, affordable essential medicines including \nantimicrobials, and vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics and other health products, \nwhile respecting and promoting human rights, gender equality, sociocultural factors \nand the dignity of the person and the principles of equality and non\u2011discrimination, \nas well as supporting and empowering those in vulnerable situations, including \nwomen, newborns, children, youth, older persons, persons with disabilities, \nimmunocompromised patients, people living with HIV/AIDS and those affected by \ntuberculosis, people of African descent, Indigenous Peoples, people living in conflict-\naffected States and humanitarian settings, including those impacted by climate change \nand natural disasters, refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants, those living \n_______________ \n \n7 A/75/903, annex. \n \n8 Resolution 78/3, annex, resolution 78/4, annex, and resolution 78/5, annex. \n\nA/RES/79/2 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on \nantimicrobial resistance\n \n24-18680\n4/15 \n \nin poverty and extreme poverty in both urban and rural areas, and people living in \nslums, informal settlements or inadequate housing; \n \n15. Recognize the profound socioeconomic challenges and financial hardships \nfaced by people affected by antimicrobial resistance, including in obtaining an early \ndiagnosis, in being subject to extremely long treatment regimens, with drugs that \ncould involve severe side effects, as well as in securing integrated support, including \nfrom the community, and therefore affirm that all these people require integrated, \npeople-centred prevention, diagnosis, treatment, management of side effects, and \ncare, as well as psychosocial, nutritional and socioeconomic support for successful \ntreatment, including to reduce stigma and discrimination;  \n \n16. Commit to scale up action to be commensurate with the present burden of \nantimicrobial resistance, with the aim of reducing the global deaths associated with \nbacterial antimicrobial resistance by 10 per cent by 2030 against the 2019 baseline of \n4.95 million deaths, and undertake to address the multifaceted and cross-cutting \nnature of antimicrobial resistance;  \n \nI. \nGovernance \n \n \n17. Recognize that sustainable, efficient and accountable governance \nstructures at local, national, regional and global levels are critical to an effective, \ncoordinated and inclusive multisectoral response, including through a One Health \napproach, and note, from annual Tracking Antimicrobial Resistance Country Self-\nAssessment Survey (TrACSS) reporting, that, while 178 countries have developed \nmultisectoral national action plans on antimicrobial resistance, only 52 per cent of \ncountries have a functioning multisectoral coordinating mechanism and only 68 per \ncent are implementing their action plans;  \n \n18. Reaffirm the importance of national ownership and the primary role and \nresponsibility of governments at all levels to determine their own path towards \nachieving universal health coverage, including through addressing antimicrobial \nresistance, in accordance with national contexts, priorities and needs, and underscore \nthe importance of political leadership for tackling antimicrobial resistance in and \nbeyond the health sector in order to pursue whole-of-government, whole-of-society \nand community-based approaches, as well as the consideration of health-in-all-\npolicies, equity-based and life-course approaches;  \n \n19. Recognize that, although progress has been made in developing and \nimplementing multisectoral national action plans on antimicrobial resistance, \nadditional and sustainable financial and technical support is needed to build and \nstrengthen capacity, especially in developing countries; \n \n20. Recognize that armed conflicts have a devastating impact on health \nsystems and antimicrobial resistance, leaving people, especially people in vulnerable \nsituations, refugees, internally displaced persons and those living in occupied \nterritories or conflict-affected areas, without full access to essential healthcare and \nexposing them to preventable diseases and other health risks, and exacerbate health \nneeds, including for mental health and psychosocial support, rehabilitation, treatment \nfor chronic diseases and others such as cancer, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis;  \n \n21. Note the need to strengthen national and regional regulatory bodies to \nadopt effective regulatory frameworks, within the national and regional context and \nas appropriate, to promote effective implementation and accountability to achieve \nstable, well-functioning and harmonized regulatory systems for medicines, and to \nprovide assistance and support to low- and middle-income countries upon their \nrequest;  \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on \nantimicrobial resistance \nA/RES/79/2\n \n5/15\n24-18680 \n \n \n22. Recognize the leading roles of the World Health Organization, the Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Organisation for \nAnimal Health and the United Nations Environment Programme, as the Quadripartite \norganizations, and the work of the standing Quadripartite Joint Secretariat on \nAntimicrobial Resistance;  \n \n23. Recognize also the contributions to global antimicrobial resistance \nresponse, including from the Global Leaders Group on Antimicrobial Resistance, the \nAntimicrobial Resistance Multi-Stakeholder Partnership Platform, and other United \nNations agencies and international organizations, where appropriate;  \n \nCommitments \n \n \n24. Ensure, by 2030, that all countries have developed or updated and are \nimplementing multisectoral national action plans on antimicrobial resistance with \nnational targets informed by analysis of existing capacities and priorities, with \ninclusive and effective national functioning multisectoral coordination mechanisms, \nand appropriate and sustainable human and financial resources, according to national \ncontexts and priorities;  \n \n25. Request the Quadripartite organizations, in consultation with Member \nStates, to update the Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance by 2026 to \nensure a robust and inclusive multisectoral response, through a One Health approach, \nthat aligns with current realities to drive greater impact against antimicrobial \nresistance, and request the Quadripartite to report biennially on progress made \ntowards their specific and joint commitments; \n \n26. Request the Quadripartite organizations to formalize the standing \nQuadripartite Joint Secretariat on Antimicrobial Resistance as the central \ncoordinating mechanism to support the global response to antimicrobial resistance, \naccording to the mandates and roles of the respective organizations; \n \n27. Invite the Quadripartite Joint Secretariat to facilitate cooperation and \nexchange with relevant multilateral organizations, including the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, the World Bank, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and \nthe World Customs Organization, on aspects of their mandates related to antimicrobial \nresistance;  \n \n28. Enhance existing frameworks and mechanisms, including but not limited \nto the Multi-Stakeholder Partnership Platform, biennial ministerial conferences on \nantimicrobial resistance and other relevant conferences, in order to facilitate the \nmultisectoral exchange of experiences and best practices and assessment of Member \nStates\u2019 progress in implementing national action plans on antimicrobial resistance, \nand which could also be an opportunity to promote the voluntary expansion of the \ndonor base of the Antimicrobial Resistance Multi-Partner Trust Fund;  \n \n29. Promote participatory, inclusive and transparent approaches to health \ngovernance for antimicrobial resistance at local, national, regional and global levels, \nincluding by exploring modalities for enhancing a meaningful whole-of-society \napproach and social participation, by involving all relevant stakeholders, such as local \ncommunities, health workers and care workers in the health sector, patients, survivors \nof antimicrobial-resistant infections, farmers, animal health and environmental and \necosystem sector professionals, academia, volunteers, civil society organizations, \nhumanitarian personnel, faith-based organizations, the private sector and youth in the \ndesign, implementation and review of national action plans on antimicrobial \nresistance, to systematically inform decisions that affect health so that policies, \nprogrammes and plans better respond to needs, while fostering trust in health systems;  \n\nA/RES/79/2 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on \nantimicrobial resistance\n \n24-18680\n6/15 \n \n \n30. Invite the Quadripartite organizations to establish an independent panel for \nevidence for action against antimicrobial resistance in 2025 to facilitate the generation \nand use of multisectoral, scientific evidence to support Member States in efforts to \ntackle antimicrobial resistance, making use of existing resources and avoiding \nduplication of ongoing efforts, after an open and transparent consultation with all \nMember States on its composition, mandate, scope and deliverables;  \n \nII. \nFinancing \n \n \n31. Recognize the need to maintain or, where necessary, increase sustainable \ninvestments at national, regional and global levels for strengthening national \ncapacities for antimicrobial resistance prevention, surveillance and response, \nespecially in developing countries, including low- and middle-income countries, \nwhich are subject to a disproportionate burden;  \n \n32. Recognize the need for countries to have in place prioritized, costed and \nfunded multisectoral national action plans on antimicrobial resistance, and express \nconcern that only 11 per cent of countries have dedicated funding in their national \nbudgets for implementation of multisectoral national action plans on antimicrobial \nresistance;  \n \n33. Recognize that health financing requires global solidarity and collective \neffort and urge Member States to strengthen international cooperation to support \nefforts to build and strengthen capacity in developing countries, including through \nenhanced official development assistance and financial and technical support and \nsupport to research, development and innovation programmes; \n \nCommitments \n \n \n34. Commit to sustainable financing and budgeted activities, as identified in \nthe national action plans on antimicrobial resistance, for their effective \nimplementation, in accordance with national contexts; \n \n35. Strengthen sustainable financing through existing funding structures and \npromote the mobilization of financial resources and investments through national, \nbilateral and multilateral channels, in particular for developing countries, especially \nlow- and middle-income countries, to support implementation of national action plans \non antimicrobial resistance, as well as their monitoring and surveillance, in \naccordance with national contexts;  \n \n36. Facilitate sustainable funding from international cooperation to support \nthe implementation of national action plans on antimicrobial resistance, with the \ntarget of achieving 100 million dollars to catalyse the achievement of at least 60 per \ncent of countries having achieved funded plans by 2030, through, inter alia, \ndiversifying funding sources and increasing the number of contributors to the \nAntimicrobial Resistance Multi-Partner Trust Fund;  \n \n37. Encourage existing financing mechanisms, including but not limited to the \nWorld Bank, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Gavi, the \nVaccine Alliance, the Green Climate Fund, the Pandemic Fund, the Climate Health \nFund, the Global Environment Facility, Nature4Health, and the Global Biodiversity \nFramework Fund, to facilitate access to existing relevant funding sources or expand, \nas appropriate, their scope to include investments to increase access to effective \nantimicrobials, prevention of infections through vaccines, research and development \nof new antimicrobials, diagnostic tools or technologies, water, hygiene and sanitation, \nand infection prevention and control, surveillance, and support implementation of \nmultisectoral national action plans on antimicrobial resistance and leverage \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on \nantimicrobial resistance \nA/RES/79/2\n \n7/15\n24-18680 \n \nprocurement and market-shaping instruments such as the Stop TB Partnership Global \nDrug Facility and Unitaid;  \n \n38. Request the Quadripartite Joint Secretariat, in collaboration with relevant \nfinancial institutions, to map existing and catalytic funding, including from the private \nsector, philanthropic organizations and development banks, in order to improve access \nto resources and leverage capacity-building and implementation of national action \nplans on antimicrobial resistance; \n \nIII. Access \n \n \n39. Recognize that equitable and timely access to effective antimicrobials, \ndiagnostics and vaccines for human and animal health remains a challenge for \ndeveloping countries, while access to existing and newly developed antimicrobials \nand complementary diagnostics remains uneven within and among countries;  \n \n40. Express concern that the supply of health products and technologies is \ndependent on manufacturing facilities concentrated in few countries and that the lack \nof national or regional production capacities, adequate infrastructure and logistics \nexpertise to store, distribute and deliver diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and other \nhealth products and technologies, particularly in developing countries, among other \nfactors, hampers efforts to achieve diagnosis, treatment and vaccination targets for \nseveral diseases, safely, efficiently, at the right time, especially in the context of health \nemergencies;  \n \n41. Note that the high prices and out-of-pocket expenditures for some health \nproducts and services, including for treating drug-resistant infections and diseases, \nand inequitable access to such products and services within and among countries, as \nwell as financial hardships associated therewith, continue to impede progress towards \nmitigating the effects of antimicrobial resistance;  \n \nCommitments \n \n \n42. Accelerate efforts to achieve universal health coverage as a means to \nensure access to essential health services as well as to strengthen veterinary services \nfor the optimal prevention, diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infections and \nantimicrobial stewardship measures;  \n \n43. Ensure equitable and timely access to and greater supply of antimicrobials, \nvaccines and diagnostics in developing countries, especially in low- and middle-\nincome countries, in line with global lists of essential medicines, including the World \nHealth Organization Model List of Essential Medicines and the global Essential \nVeterinary Medicines List, taking into account national contexts and updating \ncountry-aligned lists and treatment needs, as appropriate; \n \n44. Encourage the Quadripartite organizations, in collaboration with relevant \nentities of the United Nations development system, within their respective mandates, \nand other stakeholders as appropriate, to coordinate efforts and take actionable steps \nto support global and regional access initiatives, to ensure effective infectious disease \nmanagement, including enhancing timely and equitable access to and affordability of \nquality antimicrobials, diagnostics, vaccines and alternatives to the use of \nantimicrobials, while promoting their prudent, responsible and sustainable \nmanufacturing, appropriate use and disposal;  \n \n45. Call upon the Quadripartite organizations, in collaboration with Member \nStates upon their request and other stakeholders including the private sector and \npartnerships, such as the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership \n(GARDP), through the SECURE initiative, and the Global Drug Facility, as \n\nA/RES/79/2 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on \nantimicrobial resistance\n \n24-18680\n8/15 \n \napplicable, to take steps to increase global access to and appropriate use of \nantimicrobials in settings with the highest unmet need, including by aligning regional \nand subregional medicine registration and reforming regulatory and policy pathways, \nas necessary, to accelerate authorization of safe and effective products, especially for \nnew antimicrobials, and to consider implementing new, sustainable procurement \nmodels, such as pooled procurement, tiered pricing and by supporting measures to \nensure the resilience of supply chains for health products;  \n \nIV. Coordinated multisectoral response \n \n \n46. Recognize the need for collaborative and multisectoral efforts to address \nantimicrobial resistance through a One Health approach that fosters cooperation \nacross the human, animal and plant health, as well as environmental and other relevant \nsectors;  \n \n47. Acknowledge that increasing awareness and knowledge on antimicrobial \nresistance and all its implications requires the sharing of good practices and findings, \ncollaboration with the media and national and multisectoral actors and the allocation \nof sufficient resources for these activities across sectors;  \n \n48. Recognize that infection prevention and control across sectors, including \nthrough water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), is essential to reduce the emergence, \nre\u2011emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance and note the importance of \nensuring effective infrastructure and programmes in this regard based on scientific \nevidence;  \n \n49. Note the importance of improving the appropriate, prudent and responsible \nuse of antimicrobials across the human, animal and plant health sectors, through \nintegrated delivery of policies that promote disease prevention and antimicrobial \nstewardship;  \n \n50. Recognize the critical role that diagnostic tests and laboratory capacity \nplay in reducing antimicrobial resistance, by facilitating the appropriate, prudent and \nresponsible use of antimicrobials in all sectors, informing healthcare decisions and \nimproving patient care, while further recognizing the difficulties faced by developing \ncountries, especially low- and middle-income countries, in accessing such tests;  \n \nCommitments \n \n \n51. Enhance and sustain targeted efforts, including through a One Health \napproach, to promote awareness of antimicrobial resistance and the appropriate use \nand disposal of antimicrobials, through education and training, social science \napproaches, communication and information campaigns, including through the media, \nbehavioural change initiatives, the sharing of best practices and strengthening \nstewardship competencies and programmes across all relevant workforce sectors by \nintegrating antimicrobial resistance modules in primary, secondary and tertiary \neducation and training curricula through systematic public, private, stakeholder and \ncommunity engagement, and in this regard acknowledge the importance of engaging \npatients and families as partners in promoting safe care, and working towards locally \nmeaningful and sustainable solutions; \n \n52. Promote the alignment of national action plans on antimicrobial resistance \nand national vaccination and immunization strategies, both in the human and animal \nhealth sectors;  \n \n53. Enhance the appropriate, prudent and responsible use of antimicrobials \nacross sectors through better valuation of and investment in innovative, rapid, \neffective, validated and affordable diagnostics and laboratory systems, ensure the \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on \nantimicrobial resistance \nA/RES/79/2\n \n9/15\n24-18680 \n \naccessibility of quality testing and promote the optimal utilization of these diagnostics \nacross sectors;  \n \nHuman health \n \n \n54. Reaffirm the right of every human being to the enjoyment of the highest \nattainable standard of physical and mental health, and to enjoy the benefits of \nscientific progress and its application in order to advance towards universal access to \nquality, affordable, inclusive, equitable and timely prevention, diagnosis, treatment, \ncare and awareness-raising related to antimicrobial resistance, and address its \neconomic and social determinants; \n \n55. Acknowledge the drivers of antimicrobial resistance, including infections \nof all types; lack of regulation of over-the-counter use of antimicrobials; \noverprescription by healthcare workers; lack of evidence-based standard treatment \nand prophylaxis guidelines; poor treatment adherence; inappropriate use of \nantibiotics, including during seasonal viral outbreaks; substandard and falsified \nantimicrobial medicines, which require surveillance and legal enforcement by \nnational regulatory authorities; lack of adequate infrastructure, surveillance and \nmonitoring systems, and affordable and effective diagnostic tests, including rapid and \npoint-of-care tests; and lack of availability of and access to essential and quality-\nassured antimicrobials;  \n \n56. Note with concern the increasing burden of healthcare-associated \ninfections, including sepsis, often caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which \ncompromise patient and healthcare provider safety with an increased risk of spreading \ndrug-resistant infections to the community;  \n \n57. Recognize the need to prioritize and fund the implementation of measures \nto prevent and control infections, thereby reducing the need for antimicrobials, \nincluding through infection prevention and control programmes, vaccination, routine \nimmunization and enhancing accurate and timely diagnosis of infections through, \ninter alia, strengthening laboratory and digital capacities and the use of diagnostic and \nsurveillance data to inform treatment;  \n \n58. Recognize also that the provision of safe water, sanitation, hygiene, waste \nand electricity services is fundamental for preventing the emergence, re-emergence \nand spread of antimicrobial resistance, while noting with concern that 22 per cent of \nthe world\u2019s healthcare facilities lack basic water services and at least half lack basic \nhygiene services;  \n \n59. Acknowledge that drug-resistant tuberculosis is one of the key components \nof the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance, and express grave concern that the \nscope and scale of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis \nillness and mortality place an additional burden on health and community systems, \nespecially in low- and middle-income countries, and thereby pose a critical challenge \nthat could reverse the progress made against the disease, against antimicrobial \nresistance and towards the Sustainable Development Goals;  \n \n60. Recognize the impact of high-burden resistant pathogens, and that \nantimicrobial resistance undermines the effective treatment of bacterial, viral, fungal \nand parasitic infections, including sexually transmitted infections, as well as routine \nmedical procedures such as surgery, neonatal care, cancer treatment and control and \norgan transplants, and take into account the lessons learned and best practices from \naddressing HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, as well as neglected tropical diseases;  \n \n61. Note with concern the need to significantly reduce global levels of \nmaternal, perinatal, neonatal, infant and child mortality and morbidity caused by \n\nA/RES/79/2 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting on \nantimicrobial resistance\n \n24-18680\n10/15 \n \nantimicrobial-resistant infections and increase access to quality healthcare services, \nincluding vaccination, for newborns, infants and children, as well as all women \nbefore, during and after pregnancy and childbirth, including through providing \nantenatal and postnatal care, sufficient numbers of skilled birth attendants and \nadequately supplied birthing facilities;  \n \nCommitments \n \n \n62. Ensure that minimum requirements for national infection prevention and \ncontrol programmes in healthcare facilities are in place to provide adequate protection \nand safety for patients, health workers and visitors, through, inter alia, \nimplementation of the World Health Organization global strategy on infection \nprevention and control (2023), the Immunization Agenda 2030, the World Health \nOrganization water, sanitation and hygiene strategy 2018\u20132025 and the World Health \nOrganization global patient safety action plan 2021\u20132030, with the goal of achieving \ntheir respective targets, such as 100 per cent of countries having basic water, \nsanitation, hygiene and waste services in all healthcare facilities and 90 per cent of \ncountries meeting all World Health Organization minimum requirements for infection \nprevention and control programmes at the national level by 2030;  \n \n63. Invest in sustainable and resilient health systems, based on a primary \nhealthcare approach, to support universal access to essential health services and \npromote the timely and equitable supply of quality and affordable vaccines, \ndiagnostics and treatments, including antimicrobials, and ensure their appropriate use, \nincluding by applying or adapting the World Health Organization Access, Watch and \nReserve (AWaRe) classification of antibiotics within national contexts;  \n \n64. Ensure, by 2030, that the use of World Health Organization Access group \nantibiotics is expanded from the 2023 global target, and in that regard, taking into \naccount national contexts, aim to achieve at least 70 per cent overall human antibiotic \nuse globally, through investing in and strengthening stewardship programmes; \n \nAgriculture and Animal health \n \n \n65. Acknowledge the drivers that lead to inappropriate antimicrobial use in \nanimals and plants, including lack of regulation and guidance of over-the-counter use \nof antimicrobials; lack of evidence-based standard treatment guidelines; lack of \naffordable diagnostic tests; lack of veterinary oversight; substandard and falsified \nantimicrobial medicines, and stress the need to strengthen systems to address them; \n \n66.
