\nRecognizing that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including \nextreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement \nfor sustainable development, and acknowledging that, in many developing countries, \nbicycling to work as a mode of transportation can be directly associated with poverty \nand lack of adequate financial resources of families and inability to elevate their \nstandard of living, \n \nRecognizing also the need to strengthen and further coordinate efforts, including \nmulti-stakeholder partnerships, at all levels to maximize the

\nIntegration of mainstream bicycling into public transportation \nsystems for sustainable development\n \n22-03846\n2/3 \n \n \nRecognizing that the bicycle can serve as a tool for development and as a means \nnot just of transportation but also of access to education, health care and sport, \n \nEmphasizing that the bicycle is an instrument of sustainable transportation and \nconveys a positive message to foster sustainable consumption and production, and \nhas a positive impact on climate, \n \nAcknowledging the role of the United Nations system and its country \nprogrammes in supporting Member States, upon request, in promoting social \ndevelopment through sport, physical education, recreation and tourism, including \nmainstream bicycling for all, \n \nEmphasizing the role of productive public-private partnerships in financing \nprogrammes for the preservation of the environment, institutional development and \nphysical and social infrastructure, contributing to the achievement of the 2030 \nAgenda, including through the integration of bicycling into public transportation \nsystems, \n \nNoting that major international and local cycling competitions should be \norganized in the spirit of peace, mutual understanding, friendship, tolerance and \ninadmissibility of discrimination of any kind and that the unifying and conciliative \nnature of such events should be respected, \n \nNoting also that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has changed \ntransport needs and behaviour, and prompted many cities to rethink their \ntransportation systems, with bicycles playing a vital role in offering an economical \nand non-polluting alternative, \n \nNoting further the importance of transportation planning and policies that allow \nfor the proper integration and interoperability of advanced transportation \ntechnologies, such as shared bike services, to bring about transformative changes to \ntransportation systems, including accelerated digitalization, energy efficiency \ntechnologies and low-emission fuel technologies in line with Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 7, and to strengthen capacity-building support to developing \ncountries, \n \nAcknowledging that the bicycle is one of the most eco-friendly modes of \ntransportation that significantly reduces emissions, and that bicycling delivers far-\nreaching positive socioeconomic impacts in addition to reduced pollution, \n \nNoting the increasing use of shared bike services, cargo bicycles and adaptive \nbicycles, which has broadened both the bicycle trip purpose and the bicycling user \nbase, \n \nEmphasizing that bicycling can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions \nand addressing climate change, \n \nRecognizing the role of the bicycle as another mode of transportation that serves \nto aid community resiliency around the globe during emergencies and disasters, \n \nRecognizing also that more efficient and low-emission modes of transportation \nare possible, such as bicycling integrated into public transportation systems, and can \nbe encouraged by urban planning and the development of a quality, reliable, \nsustainable and resilient infrastructure, \n \n1. \nInvites all Member States to integrate the bicycle into public \ntransportation, in urban and rural settings in developing and developed countries, \nimprove road safety, and promote the use of bicycles by people and businesses to \nincrease bicycle trips, which in turn contributes to the achievement of sustainable \ndevelopment, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; \n\nIntegration of mainstream bicycling into public transportation \nsystems for sustainable development \nA/RES/76/255\n \n3/3\n22-03846 \n \n \n2. \nEncourages Member States to devote particular attention to the bicycle in \ncross-cutting development strategies, including bike-sharing services, and to include \nthe bicycle and bicycle network infrastructure that connects communities in \ninternational, regional, national and subnational development policies and \nprogrammes, as appropriate; \n \n3. \nAlso encourages Member States to improve road safety and integrate it \ninto sustainable active mobility and transportation infrastructure planning and design, \nin particular through policies and measures to actively protect and promote pedestrian \nand bicycling safety and mobility, with a view to broader health outcomes, in \nparticular the prevention of injuries and non-communicable diseases; \n \n4. \nEncourages all relevant stakeholders, including civil society, the private \nsector and academia, to emphasize and advance the use of the bicycle as a means of \nfostering sustainable development in line with the 2030 Agenda for
