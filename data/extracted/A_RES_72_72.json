the globalization \nof fishery markets to trade fishery products stemming from illegal, unreported and \nunregulated fishing and make economic profits from those operations, which \nconstitutes an incentive for them to pursue their activities, \n \nRecognizing that effective deterrence and combating of illegal, unreported and \nunregulated fishing has significant financial and other resource implications for all \nStates, in particular developing States,  \n \nRecognizing also that fishing by vessels without nationality on the high seas \nundermines relevant objectives of the Convention and the Agreement to conserve and \nsustainably manage marine resources, and noting with concern that fishing vessels \nwithout nationality operate on the high seas without governance and oversight,

relevant provisions of the Convention, to cooperate in the \nconservation and management of living marine resources, and recognizing the \nimportance of coordination and cooperation at the global, regional, subregional and \nnational levels in the areas, inter alia, of marine scientific research, data collection, \ninformation-sharing, capacity-building and training for the conservation, management \nand sustainable development of living marine resources, \n \nAcknowledging the importance of ocean data buoy systems moored in areas \nbeyond national jurisdiction to sustainable

Organization of the United Nations and the International \nMaritime Organization in this regard, \n \nRecalling the entry into force of the Agreement on Port State Measures to \nPrevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing of the Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 6 in 2016,  \n \nRecognizing the efforts of States, individually and through regional fisheries \nmanagement organizations and arrangements, to implement its resolution 46/215 of \n20 December 1991, in which the General Assembly called for a global moratorium \non all large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, including collaborative fisheries \nenforcement activities, \n \nConcerned that marine pollution from all sources constitutes a serious threat to \nhuman health and safety, endangers fish stocks, marine biodiversity and marine and \ncoastal habitats and has significant costs to local and national economies, \n \nRecognizing that marine debris is a global transboundary pollution problem and \nthat, owing to the many different types and sources of marine debris, different \napproaches to its prevention and removal are necessary, including identification of \nsuch sources and environmentally sound techniques for its removal,  \n \nRecognizing also that the majority of marine debris, including plastics and \nmicroplastics, entering the seas and oceans is considered to originate from land-based \nsources,  \n \nRecognizing further that abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear, \nincluding ghost fishing gear, is an increasingly pervasive and destructive form of \nmarine debris causing adverse impacts on fish stocks, marine life and the marine \nenvironment and that urgent preventative action is needed, such as marking of fishing \ngear as proposed by the Committee on Fisheries, as well as removal action, \n \nReaffirming the importance of sustainable aquaculture to food security, \nrecognizing that aquaculture is already making a significant contribution to the global \nseafood supply and that a further increase in that contribution is anticipated, \n \nNoting that the contribution of sustainable aquaculture to global fish supplies \ncontinues to respond to opportunities in developing countries to enhance local food \nsecurity and nutrition and poverty alleviation and, together with the efforts of other \naquaculture-producing countries, will make a significant contribution to meeting \nfuture demands in fish consumption, bearing in mind article 9 of the Code, \n__________________ \n \n6  Food and

vulnerable marine ecosystems, \n \nCalling attention to the particular vulnerabilities of small island developing \nStates, other developing coastal States and subsistence fishing communities whose \nlivelihoods, economic development and food security are heavily dependent on \nsustainable fisheries and will suffer disproportionately if sustainable fisheries are \nnegatively affected, \n \nCalling attention also to the circumstances affecting fisheries in many \ndeveloping States, in particular African States and small island developing States, and \nrecognizing the urgent need for capacity-building, including the transfer of marine \ntechnology and in particular fisheries- and aquaculture-related technology, to enhance \nthe ability of such States to exercise their rights in order to realize the benefits from \nfisheries resources and fulfil their obligations under international instruments, \n \nRecognizing the need to adopt, implement and enforce appropriate measures to \nminimize waste, by-catch and discards, including high-grading, loss of fishing gear \nand other factors that adversely affect the sustainability of fish stocks and ecosystems \nand, consequently, can also have harmful effects on the economies and food security \nof small island developing States, other developing coastal States and subsistence \nfishing communities, \n \nRecognizing also the need to adopt and implement appropriate measures, \nconsistent with the best available scientific information, to minimize by-catch of non-\ntargeted species and juveniles through the effective management of fishing methods, \nincluding the use and design of fish aggregating devices, in order to mitigate adverse \neffects on fish stocks and ecosystems, \n \nRecognizing further the need to further integrate ecosystem approaches into \nfisheries conservation and management and, more generally, the importance of \napplying ecosystem approaches to the management of human activities in the ocean, \nand noting in this regard the Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fisheries in the \nMarine Ecosystem,7 the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations related to guidelines for the implementation of the ecosystem approach to \nfisheries management and the importance of this approach to relevant provisions of \nthe Agreement and the Code, as well as decision VII/11 8 and other relevant decisions \nof the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, \n \nRecognizing the economic and cultural importance of sharks in many countries, \nthe biological importance of sharks in the marine ecosystem as key predatory species, \nthe vulnerability of certain shark species to overexploitation, the fact that some are \nthreatened with extinction, the need for measures to promote the long-term \nconservation, management and sustainable use of shark populations and fisheries, and \nthe relevance of the International Plan of Action

of the implementation of the International Plan of Action for \nthe Conservation and Management of Sharks, and its ongoing work in this regard, \n \nNoting with concern that basic data on shark stocks and harvests continue to be \nlacking and that not all regional fisheries management organizations and \narrangements have adopted conservation and management measures for directed \nshark fisheries and for the regulation of by-catch of sharks from other fisheries, \n \nWelcoming science-based measures taken by States to conserve and sustainably \nmanage sharks, and noting in this respect management measures taken by coastal \nStates, including limits on catch or fishing effort, technical measures, including by-\ncatch reduction measures, sanctuaries, closed seasons and areas and monitoring, \ncontrol and surveillance, \n \nRecalling the decisions on sharks and rays adopted at the seventeenth meeting \nof the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade
