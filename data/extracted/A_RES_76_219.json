greatest global challenge facing the world today and is an \nindispensable requirement for sustainable development, particularly in Africa, in the \nleast developed countries, in landlocked developing countries, in small island \ndeveloping States and in some middle-income countries, noting with concern that as \nof 2017 approximately 696 million people still lived in extreme poverty and that the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is estimated to have pushed an additional \n97 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, and underlining the importance of \naccelerating sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable \ndevelopment, including full, productive employment and decent work for all, with a \nview to reducing inequalities within and among countries, \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety \nand well-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as \nthe severe disruption to

\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build \nresilience to future shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health \nsystems and achieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and \ntimely access for all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, \ntherapeutics and diagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, \nsolidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one \nbehind, \n \nNoting that over 46 per cent of the global rural population is

\n\nEradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development \nA/RES/76/219\n \n3/8\n21-19283 \n \npoverty is fundamental for the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 1 of \nthe 2030 Agenda, as well as most of the other Goals, with 70 per cent of the targets \nrequiring action in rural areas, emphasizing that the impacts of the COVID-19 \npandemic on sustainable development have increased the number of people living in \npoverty around the world and disrupted, inter alia, the normal functioning of open \nmarkets, global supply chain connectivity and the flow of essential goods, hindering \nthe fight against poverty and adding urgency to the call to galvanize action and \ndelivery for the eradication of poverty, in all its forms and dimensions, particularly in \nrural areas, where most of the extreme poor live, stressing that global inequities in \naccess to COVID-19 vaccines, with the bulk of vaccines disproportionately available \nin high-income countries, in contrast with the low availability of COVID-19 vaccines \nin low-income countries, further put at risk the health of the rural poor, in this regard \nwelcoming the Sustainable Development Goals Moment placing an emphasis on \npoverty and inequality, on climate change and a healthy planet and on achieving \ngender equality, taking note of the efforts of the President of the General Assembly at \nits seventy-fourth session to launch the Alliance for Poverty Eradication, which is \ntimely and meaningful and continues to serve as a platform for the exchange of ideas, \npolicies and best practices on poverty eradication, and stressing the importance of \naddressing poverty, including rural poverty issues, in these forums, as the rural poor \nmight be less prepared to deal with the effects of and recover from the COVID-19 \ncrisis and could have less access to adequate sanitation, food and nutrition, health-\ncare services, education, the Internet, information and communications technology, \nsocial protection, financial services and public infrastructure, \n \nCommending the efforts and remarkable progress achieved by developing \ncountries in eradicating rural poverty, while noting with concern that key gaps still \nremain, such as: a lack of adequate data; inadequate investment in agricultural and \nrural development; lower and inadequate human capital formation relevant for rural \nlivelihoods; scarce non-farm income-generating opportunities; a lack of productive \ncapacity and agricultural transformation; persistent gender inequality; a lack of social \nprotection; insufficient basic infrastructure and services; a lack of or poor adaptive \ncapacity and resilience to cope with the adverse effects of climate change and \ndisasters; and a lack of effective rural institutions and of sufficient resources,  \n \nRecognizing the leading role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations, together with other United Nations entities, including the \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development, the International Labour \nOrganization and the United Nations Development Programme, in the global efforts \nto reduce rural poverty, while addressing other interlinked challenges such as \neliminating hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition and increasing the resilience of \nlivelihoods to threats and crises, \n \nNoting with appreciation the aspirations, embedded in Agenda 2063 of the \nAfrican Union, to lift huge sections of the population out of poverty, improve incomes \nand catalyse economic and social transformation, and recognizing the importance of \nthe international community\u2019s helping African countries to achieve such goals, \nespecially in the rural areas of the African continent,  \n \nNoting that, while considerable progress has been made over the past decade \nacross all areas of development, the pace of progress observed in recent years is \ninsufficient and uneven to fully meet the Sustainable Development Goals and targets \nby 2030, especially in the area of rural poverty eradication,  \n \nRecognizing that poverty is a serious impediment to the achievement of gender \nequality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including those living in rural \nareas, and that the feminization of poverty persists, emphasizing that the eradication \nof poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is an \n\nA/RES/76/219 \nEradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development\n \n21-19283\n4/8 \n \nindispensable requirement for sustainable development, acknowledging the mutually \nreinforcing links between the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment \nof all women and girls and the eradication of poverty, and stressing the importance of \nsupport for countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms and \ndimensions,  \n \nEmphasizing that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda depends crucially on \nthe transformation of rural areas, where most of the poor and hungry live, and that, in \norder to eradicate rural poverty, investment should be channelled towards sectors that \nhave a bigger impact, such as education and health, agriculture and infrastructure, \nwhile noting an annual financing gap for reaching universal pre-primary, primary and \nsecondary education of good quality in low-income and lower middle-income \ncountries of 44 billion United States dollars over the period 2015\u20132030, and that at \nleast 80 billion dollars in annual investment will be needed to meet the demand for \nfood that is projected to increase by 70 per cent by 2050, and that the investments that \nare needed for climate change mitigation and adaptation also remain underfunded,  \n \nRecalling the proclamation of 2019\u20132028 as the United Nations Decade of \nFamily Farming, to raise the profile of the role of family farming4 in contributing to \nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and reaffirming the importance of the United \nNations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016\u20132025) in the promotion of activities \ntowards the eradication of rural poverty, \n \nRecognizing the interlinkages and integrated nature of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, and reiterating that the eradication of rural poverty and hunger \nis crucial for the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including \nthose contained in the 2030 Agenda, and that rural development should be pursued \nthrough an integrated approach which encompasses economic, social and \nenvironmental dimensions, takes into account a gender perspective and consists of \nmutually reinforcing policies and programmes, and which should be balanced, \ntargeted, situation-specific and locally owned, include local synergies and initiatives \nand be responsive to the needs of rural populations, \n \nRecalling that nearly 80 per cent of the extreme poor live in rural areas and work \nin agriculture, that the extreme poverty rate in rural areas is three times higher than \nin urban areas and that devoting resources to the development of rural areas and \nsustainable agriculture and supporting smallholder farmers, especially women \nfarmers, is key to ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions, by, inter alia, \nimproving the welfare of farmers, \n \nTaking into consideration the increasing number of young people who decide to \nleave rural areas for more urbanized ones and the challenges that this trend poses to \nthe livelihood of rural families, \n \nExpressing its concern that the extreme poor have limited access to productive \nresources, basic health, education and social protection services, basic infrastructure \nsuch as roads, water and electricity, and off-farm employment opportunities, and are \nsusceptible to the impacts of natural disasters, especially weather-related hazards, \nincluding the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, and the adverse effects of climate change, and \nthat rural women and girls fare far worse on most development indicators,  \n \nEmphasizing the importance of enhancing global support for national work on \nrural development policies and strategies, including on commodity production as well \nas increased public and private investments to upgrade productive capacity, and that \ntackling rural poverty requires integrated, cross-sectoral, multi-stakeholder and \ncontext-specific interventions, with a strong emphasis on sustainable food and \n__________________ \n \n4

economic growth, revitalization and \ndevelopment in rural areas,  \n \n1. \nTakes note of the report of the Secretary-General5 and the recommendations \ncontained therein; \n \n2. \nReaffirms that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, \nincluding extreme poverty, for all people everywhere, is the greatest global challenge \nand an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, as well as an \noverarching objective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 6 of which \nthe Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing \nfor Development7 is an integral part, supporting and complementing it; \n \n3. \nExpresses its deep concern that the progress in reducing poverty remains \nuneven, with 1.3 billion people still living in multidimensional poverty, and that this \nnumber continues to be significant and unacceptably high, whereas the levels of \ninequality in income, wealth and opportunities remain high or are increasing in a \nnumber of countries, and the non-income dimensions of poverty and deprivation, such \nas access to quality education or basic health services, and relative poverty remain \nmajor concerns, and stresses the importance of national and global efforts to create \nconditions for sustainable development, inclusive and sustained economic growth, \nshared prosperity and decent work for all in society, taking into account different \nlevels of national development capacities; \n \n4. \nRecognizes the importance of promoting socioeconomic development in \nrural areas as an effective strategy and important means at the global level for the \neradication of poverty, including extreme poverty, and therefore underlines the \nimportance of shaping a rural poverty eradication pattern with the concerted efforts \nof the whole of society to promote socioeconomic development in rural areas; \n \n5. \nEmphasizes that economic growth continues to leave rural dwellers \nbehind, that, circa 2018, 80 per cent of the people living in extreme poverty lived in \nrural areas and 40.2 per cent of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lived on less \nthan 1.90 dollars per day in 2018, and recommends that countries promote dedicated \nand coordinated social, economic, agricultural and rural development in their national \npolicies, including by adopting rural-focused poverty eradication strategies in \nalignment with the 2030 Agenda, social policies aimed at improving human capital in \nrural areas and ensuring access to adequate social protection coverage, agricultural \npolicies aimed at boosting agricultural productivity, and rural development policies \naimed at improving access to rural infrastructure and basic services of high quality \nand at boosting non-farm employment opportunities;  \n \n6. \nRecognizes the critical role and contribution of rural women, including \nsmallholders and women farmers, and indigenous women and women in local \ncommunities, and their traditional knowledge in enhancing agricultural and rural \ndevelopment, improving food security and eradicating rural poverty; \n \n7. \nStresses the importance of taking targeted measures to eradicate poverty \nin all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, by formulating rural \ndevelopment strategies with clear poverty eradication goals, strengthening national \nstatistical capacity and monitoring systems and implementing nationally appropriate \nsocial protection systems and measures for all;  \n \n8. \nEncourages all countries and other relevant stakeholders to promote

\nreliable and appropriate social protection systems, quality and resilient infrastructure, \nroads and telecommunications, as well as preparedness planning for crises and early \nwarning, reiterates that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the important role \nof digital connectivity and access and the potential of e-commerce and e-learning \nsolutions for poverty eradication, and thus calls upon all stakeholders to strengthen \ndigital, information and communications technology, science, technology and \ninnovation cooperation, especially in the area of e-commerce, financial technology \n(fintech), affordable and reliable Internet connectivity and digital infrastructure \nconstruction to keep food and agriculture supply chains functioning and achieve \nmomentum under the 2030 Agenda for an inclusive, sustainable and resilient recovery \nfor global development, in particular in rural areas, putting people at the centre of the \nresponse, protecting our planet and achieving prosperity, with no one left behind, in \nline with the 2030 Agenda; \n \n9. \nRecognizes that eradicating poverty in rural areas cannot be separated from \nthe transformation and strengthening of food systems and that ensuring fair markets \nthat enable the participation of smallholder and family farmers in food systems, \nparticularly in value chains where small-scale producers have a comparative \nadvantage, will continue to be important, in this regard takes note with appreciation \nof the United Nations Food Systems Summit, held in 2021, which recognized the \ntransformative effects of food systems as a driver for the achievement of the \nSustainable Development Goals by 2030, underscores that promoting a universal, \nrules-based, open, transparent, predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and \nequitable multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization is essential \nfor building sustainable, inclusive and resilient food systems, and calls upon all \ncountries to promote agricultural and rural development in their national policies, \nrenew their efforts to promote the use of innovative approaches towards achieving \nsustainable agriculture and food systems, including sustainable productivity growth, \nsignificantly reducing food loss and waste, and strengthen policies that support small-\nscale producers in engaging in agriculture and food system value chains; \n \n10. Also recognizes the importance of employment for pro-poor growth in \nrural areas, and encourages the United Nations system and development partners to \nassist countries, upon their request, in mainstreaming employment into investment \npolicy and poverty reduction strategies, including those focused on rural area \ndevelopment, and fostering rapid agricultural productivity growth, especially in \ndeveloping countries, by increasing investment in agricultural and related rural off-\nfarm activities;  \n \n11. Further recognizes the need to design, implement and pursue gender-\nresponsive economic and social policies aimed at, inter alia, eradicating poverty, \nincluding in rural areas, and combating the feminization of poverty, ensuring the full \nand equal participation of rural women in the development, implementation and \nfollow-up of development policies and programmes and poverty eradication \nstrategies, supporting increased rural employment and decent work, and promoting \nthe participation of women at all levels and sectors of the rural economy and in \ndiverse on-farm and off-farm economic activities, including sustainable agricultural \nand fisheries production;  \n \n12. Encourages Member States, international organizations, the private sector \nand other partners to develop programmes to foster the creation of decent work in \nrural areas and increase the investment in agricultural and related off-farm activities, \nespecially for young people; \n \n13. Emphasizes that, globally, 2 billion people, primarily in rural areas in \ndeveloping countries, do not have access to formal financial services, and encourages \n\nEradicating rural poverty to implement the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development \nA/RES/76/219\n \n7/8\n21-19283 \n \nfurther efforts of the international community to offer affordable ways to access \nfinance for the financially excluded in rural areas;  \n \n14. Also emphasizes the need to increase investment, including through \nenhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, especially in roads, water, \nsanitation and electricity; \n \n15. Expresses its commitment to raising public awareness to promote the \neradication of poverty and extreme poverty in all countries, to mobilizing the \nenthusiasm and creativity of all stakeholders, especially the rural residents living in \nextreme poverty, to fight against poverty, to promoting their active participation in \nthe design and implementation of programmes and policies that affect them, and to \nproviding quality education for the rural poor, with the aim of achieving the 2030 \nAgenda; \n \n16. Reiterates the need for enhanced and expanded access by developing \ncountries to appropriate technologies that are pro-poor and raise productivity, and \nunderlines the need for measures to increase investment in agriculture, including \nmodern technologies, as well as in natural resources management and capacity-\nbuilding of developing countries;  \n \n17. Stresses that the achievement of sustainable development and the \neradication of poverty also hinge on the ability and readiness of countries to \neffectively mobilize domestic resources, attract foreign direct investment, fulfil \nofficial development assistance commitments and use official development assistance \neffectively, and facilitate the transfer of technology to developing countries, on \nmutually agreed terms, and further stresses that the resolution of unsustainable debt \nsituations is critical for heavily indebted poor countries, while remittances have \nbecome a significant source of income and finance for receiving economies and their \ncontribution to the achievement of sustainable development; \n \n18. Recognizes the importance of addressing the diverse needs of and \nchallenges faced by countries in special situations, in particular African countries, the \nleast developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island \ndeveloping States, as well as the specific challenges facing many middle-income \ncountries, and therefore requests the United Nations development system, the \ninternational financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders to \nensure that these diverse and specific development needs are appropriately considered \nand addressed, in a tailored fashion, in their relevant strategies and policies, with a \nview to promoting a coherent and comprehensive approach towards individual \ncountries;  \n \n19.
