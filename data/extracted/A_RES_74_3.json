We call upon the international community to mobilize additional development \nfinance from all sources and at all levels to support small island developing States\u2019 \nefforts. \n11. \nWe acknowledge the value of partnerships as a means of supporting the \nsustainable development of small island developing States and note the establishment \nof the Small Island Developing States Partnership Framework. We renew our \ncommitment to working in meaningful partnerships with small island developing \nStates. \n12. We note the importance of oceans, seas and marine resources to small island \ndeveloping States and acknowledge their efforts to develop and implement strategies \nfor the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its resources. We reiterate \nthe call made in the declaration entitled \u201cOur ocean, our future: call for action\u201d9 and \nencourage the fulfilment of voluntary commitments pledged in the context of the \nUnited Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine \nresources for sustainable development and recall the decision to convene the \n2020 Conference.  \n13. We emphasize the importance of the negotiations for an international legally \nbinding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on \nthe conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond \nnational jurisdiction in line with resolution 72/249 of 24 December 2017.  \n14. We underscore the importance of eradicating poverty in all its forms and \ndimensions, including extreme poverty. Eradicating poverty is the greatest global \nchallenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, as well as \nan overarching objective of the 2030 Agenda for small island developing States and \nother developing countries.  \n \n \n \nProgress, gaps and challenges  \n \n15. We recognize that gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment and the full \nrealization of human rights for women and girls have a transformative and multiplier \neffect on sustainable development and are drivers of economic growth in small island \ndeveloping States. Women can be powerful agents of change. We note and support \nongoing efforts in small island developing States to achieve gender equality and \nwomen\u2019s empowerment, including economic empowerment, and full and equal \nparticipation and leadership and to end gender-based violence. \n16. We note the advances in social inclusion by many small island developing \nStates, but are concerned that poverty, unemployment, inequality and exclusion \ncontinue to disproportionately affect people in vulnerable situations.  \n17. We recognize the efforts of small island developing States in promoting \npeaceful, prosperous, inclusive societies and safe communities on their paths toward \nsustainable development.  \n18. We recognize the need for the prevention, detection and treatment of \ncommunicable and non-communicable diseases. We are concerned that these diseases \nand the health-related impact from disasters are endangering the delivery of quality \nand accessible health care in small island developing States.  \n19. We recognize that small island developing States face significant challenges in \naccessing sufficient affordable financing for sustainable development, including \nconcessional financing, as their incomes grow. We also recognize the need to devise \n__________________ \n \n9  Resolution 71/312, annex. \n\nA/RES/74/3 \nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting to review progress \nmade in addressing the priorities of small island developing \nStates through the implementation of the SIDS Accelerated \nModalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway\n \n19-17550\n4/8 \n \nmethodologies to better account for the complex and diverse realities of middle-\nincome countries as outlined in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.  \n20. We remain committed to assisting small island developing States to further \nexplore innovative financial instruments and mechanisms, such as debt for \ndevelopment swaps, debt for climate adaptation swaps, blue or green bonds among \nothers, while remaining mindful of the need to ease debt burdens with a view to \nimproving small island developing States\u2019 access to finance.  \n21. We reaffirm that successful engagement in international trade is a key driver for \nsustainable economic growth and sustainable development. We are concerned that \nsmall island developing States continue to face challenges in engaging in the \nmultilateral trading system.  \n22. We acknowledge that remittances represent a major source of external financing \nin many small island developing States. We are concerned that they still face \nsignificant obstacles to the flow of and access to remittances, including costs, policies \nand access to correspondent banking relationships and services.  \n23. We recognize and are concerned by the transition challenges encountered by \nsmall island developing States that have graduated or are about to graduate from least \ndeveloped country status. We remain mindful that graduation must not disrupt a \ncountry\u2019s development progress. We stress the need for the development and \nimplementation of a viable multiannual transition strategy to facilitate each small \nisland developing State\u2019s graduation, with the support of the international community \nwhere appropriate, to mitigate against, inter alia, the possible loss of concessionary \nfinancing, to reduce the risks of falling heavily into debt and to ensure macrofinancial \nstability.  \n24. We stress the importance of access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and \nmodern energy for small island developing States. We welcome all initiatives, such \nas the International Renewable Energy Agency and SIDS DOCK, to support small \nisland developing States to fully exploit their renewable energy potential, improve \nenergy efficiency and reduce dependence on imported sources of energy, noting the \nrole of appropriate energy sources and technologies in the energy mix, and call for \nfurther work and enhanced support. \n25. We commend the ongoing efforts made by small island developing States to \nmake improvements to their transportation connectivity. We recognize the important \nrole of sustainable transportation in promoting policy synergies, trade facilitation, \ninfrastructure connectivity, financial cooperation and people-to-people exchange, \nwhich are key areas in achieving sustainable development.  \n26. We recognize that disaster risk reduction is key to advancing sustainable \ndevelopment, in all its dimensions, and resilient societies and note that many small \nisland developing States still experience severe disaster repercussions, including, \ninter alia, significant loss of life, biodiversity and infrastructure destruction, disaster-\ninduced human mobility and threats to food security and nutrition.  \n27. We also recognize the diverse approaches to address climate change, inter alia \necosystem-based approaches, as part of overall adaptation, disaster risk reduction and \nresilience strategies for small island developing States, in the face of the adverse \neffects of climate change.  \n28. We reiterate the need for improved data collection and statistical analysis, \nincluding high-quality and disaggregated data, to enable small island developing \nStates to better plan, monitor and evaluate the implementation of the Samoa Pathway, \nthe 2030 Agenda and the Sendai Framework monitor.  \n\nPolitical declaration of the high-level meeting to review progress \nmade in addressing the priorities of small island developing \nStates through the implementation of the SIDS Accelerated \nModalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway \nA/RES/74/3\n \n5/8\n19-17550 \n \n29. We recognize that science, technology and innovation are essential enablers and \ndrivers for sustainable development and, in this regard, we reaffirm our commitment \nto support the efforts of small island developing States to gain access, on mutually \nagreed terms, to appropriate, reliable, affordable, modern and environmentally sound \ntechnologies.  \n \n \n \nCall for action \n \n30.
