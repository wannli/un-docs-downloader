Recognize that ending AIDS requires ending all inequalities and driving \nmultisectoral action across a range of Sustainable Development Goals and targets, \nand that the HIV response is making a vital contribution to the achievement of the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;  \n \n13. Also recognize that poverty and poor health are inextricably linked and \nthat poverty can increase the risk of progression from HIV to AIDS owing to a lack \nof access to comprehensive treatment-related services and adequate nutrition and care \nservices and to the inability to meet costs related to treatment services, including \ntransportation;  \n \n14. Note that 2021 marks 40 years since the first cases of AIDS were reported, \n25 years since the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS commenced its \nwork as a unique multi-stakeholder and multisectoral programme to lead the efforts \nof the United Nations system against the global AIDS epidemic and 20 years since \nthe landmark 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the decision to \nestablish the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; \n \n \n \nProgress and gaps \n \n \n15. Express deep concern that the global AIDS epidemic continues to affect \nevery region of the world, remaining a global emergency and a paramount health, \ndevelopment, human rights and social challenge; \n \n16. Recognize that, while AIDS is a global epidemic, with 38 million people \nglobally living with HIV, national and regional epidemics have different \ncharacteristics and drivers and that, based on different epidemiological contexts, \ndifferentiated responses and interventions are required for addressing them; \n \n17. Welcome and encourage regional efforts to set ambitious targets and \ndesign and implement strategies on HIV and AIDS;  \n \n18. Reiterate with profound concern that, while Africa, in particular sub-Saharan \nAfrica, is the region that has demonstrated the most substantial progress, it remains \nthe worst-affected region and that urgent and exceptional action is required at all \nlevels to curb the devastating effects of the epidemic, particularly on women, \nadolescent girls and children;  \n \n19. Express deep concern that in 2019 HIV and AIDS affected every region of \nthe world, welcome recent reductions in HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths \nachieved in Asia and the Pacific, the Caribbean, Western and Central Europe and \nNorth America, and note with concern that despite progress, the Caribbean continues \nto have the highest prevalence outside sub-Saharan Africa, while the number of new \nHIV infections is increasing in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and \nthe Middle East and North Africa, and note that 90 per cent of people newly infected \nwith HIV live in just 41 countries;  \n \n20. Welcome the progress achieved since the 2001 Declaration, including a \n54 per cent reduction in AIDS-related deaths and a 37 per cent reduction in HIV \ninfections globally, including a 68 per cent reduction in vertical transmission of HIV, \nwhile noting with concern that overall progress has dangerously slowed since 2016;  \n \n21. Express deep concern that insufficient progress has been made in reducing \nHIV infections, with 1.7 million new infections in 2019 compared to the 2020 global \ntarget of fewer than 500,000 infections, and that new HIV infections have increased \nin at least 33 countries since 2016; \n \n22. Note with concern that inequalities across multiple forms and dimensions, \nwhilst different in different national contexts, can include those based on HIV status, \ngender, race, ethnicity, disability, age, income level, education, occupation, \n\nPolitical Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Ending Inequalities and \nGetting on Track to End AIDS by 2030 \nA/RES/75/284\n \n5/19\n21-07531 \n \ngeographic disparities, migratory status and incarceration and these often overlap to \ncompound each other, and have contributed to the failure to reach the 2020 global \nHIV targets; \n \n23. Note with alarm that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing \ninequalities, created additional setbacks and pushed the AIDS response, especially \naccess to medicines, treatments and diagnostics, further off track, widening fault lines \nwithin a deeply unequal world and exposing the dangers of under-investment in public \nhealth, health systems and other essential public services for all and pandemic \npreparedness;  \n \n24. Welcome recent efforts by countries to put in place societal enablers, \nincluding enabling laws, policies, public education campaigns and anti-stigma \ntraining for health-care workers and law enforcement that dispel the stigma and \ndiscrimination that still surrounds HIV, empower women and girls to take charge of \ntheir sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the \nProgramme of Action of the International Conference on Population and \nDevelopment, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome \ndocuments of their review conferences, and end the marginalization of people living \nwith and at higher risk of HIV infection; \n \n25. Note that each country should define the specific populations that are \ncentral to their epidemic and response, based on the local epidemiological context \nand note with concern that global epidemiological evidence demonstrates that key \npopulations are more likely to be exposed to HIV or to transmit it, and that these \ninclude people living with HIV, men who have sex with men who are at 26 times \nhigher risk of HIV acquisition, people who inject drugs who are at 29 times higher \nrisk of HIV acquisition, female sex workers who are at 30 times higher risk of HIV \nacquisition, transgender people who are at 13 times higher risk of HIV acquisition, \nand people in prisons and other closed settings who have six times higher HIV \nprevalence than the general population, and further note with concern that these \npopulations and their sexual partners account for 62 per cent of new HIV infections \nglobally and for 98 per cent in Asia and the Pacific, 60 per cent in the Caribbean, 99 \nper cent in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, 28 per cent in Eastern and Southern \nAfrica, 77 per cent in Latin America, 97 per cent in the Middle East and North Africa, \n69 per cent in Western and Central Africa and 96 per cent in Western and Central \nEurope and North America; \n \n26. Note that, depending on the epidemiological and social context of a \nparticular country, other populations may be at elevated risk of HIV, including women \nand adolescent girls and their male partners, young people, children, persons with \ndisabilities, ethnic and racial minorities, indigenous peoples, local communities, \npeople living in poverty, migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons, men and \nwomen in uniform and people in humanitarian emergencies and conflict and \npost-conflict situations; \n \n27. Express concern that, in sub-Saharan Africa, five out of six new infections \namong adolescents aged 15\u201319 years are among girls, that adolescent girls and young \nwomen (15\u201324 years) account for 24 per cent of HIV infections despite representing \n10 per cent of the population, and that AIDS is the leading cause of death for \nadolescent girls and women aged between 15 and 49 years;  \n \n28. Express deep concern about stigma, discrimination, violence and \nrestrictive and discriminatory laws and practices that target people living with, at risk \nof and affected by HIV \u2013 including for non-disclosure, exposure and transmission of \nHIV \u2013 and laws that restrict the movement or access to services for people living with, \nat risk of and affected by HIV, including key populations, young people, women and \n\nA/RES/75/284 \nPolitical Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Ending Inequalities and \nGetting on Track to End AIDS by 2030\n \n21-07531\n6/19 \n \ngirls in diverse situations and conditions, and in this regard, deplore acts of violence \nand discrimination in all regions of the world against them; \n \n29. Recognize that sexual and gender-based violence, including intimate \npartner violence, the unequal socioeconomic status of women, structural barriers to \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment and insufficient protection of the sexual and \nreproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Programme of \nAction of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing \nDeclaration and Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review \nconferences, of women and girls compromise their ability to protect themselves from \nHIV infection and aggravate the impact of AIDS; \n \n30. Note with grave concern that the holistic needs and human rights of people \nliving with, at risk of and affected by HIV, and of women and young people, remain \ninsufficiently addressed because of inadequate integration of health services, \nincluding sexual and reproductive health-care services and HIV services, including \nfor people who have experienced sexual or gender-based violence, including \npost-exposure prophylaxis, legal services and social protection; \n \n31. Note with concern that men generally have poorer outcomes than women \nacross the HIV testing and treatment cascade;  \n \n32. Note with concern that globally HIV continues to disproportionately \nimpact young people and that young people\u2019s knowledge and awareness of HIV and \nAIDS and access to and use of essential HIV-related services remain unacceptably \nlow, that condom use is on the decline and that young people, who represent 16 per \ncent of the global population, account for 28 per cent of new HIV infections, while \nstressing the need to create an environment that does not allow the dissemination of \nscientifically inaccurate information about HIV, including HIV denialism; \n \n33. Note with alarm that 150,000 children were vertically infected with HIV \nin 2019 compared to the 2020 target of 20,000, while 850,000 children living with \nHIV were not on treatment, in part because of the lack of early infant diagnosis \ncoverage and lack of testing options for older children who acquire HIV during \nbreastfeeding, and thus that 47 per cent of children living with HIV globally \u2013 two-\nthirds of whom are 5 years old or older \u2013 do not have access to life-saving treatment, \nespecially in developing countries, as a result of similar social and structural barriers \nas the adult population faces, as well as age-specific barriers, including low rates of \ndiagnosis, inadequate case-finding of children outside of vertical transmission \nprevention settings, poor linkage of children to treatment and limited number and \ninadequate availability of efficacious antiretroviral child-friendly formulations, in \ncertain countries and regions, stigma and discrimination, and lack of adequate social \nprotection for children and caregivers; \n \n34. Note that, thanks to the increased access to antiretroviral therapy, a rising \nnumber of people are living longer with HIV, but note with concern that older persons \nliving with HIV may face particular challenges, such as stigma and discrimination in \nhealth-care settings, treatment access and maintenance, and greater risk of \nnon-communicable diseases and other comorbidities, including mental health \nconditions;  \n \n35. Underscore the critical role of science and technology, including \nbiomedical and clinical science, social and behavioural science and political and \neconomic science, and evidence-based approaches in shaping the direction of and \naccelerating the HIV response;  \n \n36. Underscore that combination HIV prevention is a cornerstone of an \neffective HIV response and includes the following evidence-based interventions \ndependent on national and regional epidemic characteristics: male and female \n\nPolitical Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Ending Inequalities and \nGetting on Track to End AIDS by 2030 \nA/RES/75/284\n \n7/19\n21-07531 \n \ncondoms and lubricant, treatment as prevention, pre-exposure prophylaxis, \npost-exposure prophylaxis, voluntary medical male circumcision, harm reduction, 15 \nin accordance with national legislation, comprehensive information and education, \nincluding in and out of school, screening and treatment of sexually transmitted \ninfections, quality secondary education, economic empowerment, sexual and \nreproductive health, reducing risk-taking behaviour and encouraging safer sexual \nbehaviour, including correct and consistent use of condoms, prevention of sexual and \ngender-based violence, poverty reduction and food security, and blood safety, and in \nthis regard note with alarm the limited scale of combination prevention programmes; \n \n37. Note with concern that the majority of countries and regions have not made \nsignificant progress in expanding harm reduction programmes, in accordance with \nnational legislation, as well as antiretroviral therapy and other relevant interventions \nthat prevent the transmission of HIV, viral hepatitis and other blood-borne diseases \nassociated with drug use, particularly those who inject drugs, and call urgent attention \nto the insufficient coverage of programmes and substance use treatment programmes \nthat improve adherence to HIV drug treatment services, the marginalization of and \ndiscrimination against people who use drugs, particularly those who inject drugs, \nthrough the application of restrictive laws, which hamper access to HIV-related \nservices, and in that regard, ensure access to and use of the full range of such \ninterventions, including in prevention, treatment and outreach services, prisons and \nother closed settings, and promoting in that regard the use, as appropriate, of the \ntechnical guidance issued by the World Health Organization, the United Nations \nOffice on Drugs and Crime and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, \nand note with concern that gender-based and age-based stigma and discrimination \noften act as additional barriers for women and for young people who use drugs, \nparticularly those who inject drugs, to access and use these services; \n \n38. Commend progress achieved in research, development and proven \nefficacy of innovative HIV interventions, including advances in treatment as \nprevention, pre-exposure prophylaxis, long-acting antiretrovirals for prevention and \ntreatment, antiretroviral-based microbicides and other female-initiated options to \nreduce the risk of HIV infections, such as vaginal rings, and ongoing initiatives to \ndefine and address the threat of antimicrobial resistance in relation to HIV and \nassociated diseases, comorbidities and coinfections, especially tuberculosis;  \n \n39. Welcome the recent scientific evidence related to the preventative benefits \nof antiretroviral drug therapy, demonstrating no evidence of sexual transmission of \nHIV within adult couples when the HIV-positive partner is on effective and sustained \ntreatment, with undetectable viral loads, confirmed by routine testing at intervals as \nrecommended by the World Health Organization and reflected in its updated 2021 \nguidelines, which is known as \u201cUndetectable = Untransmittable (U = U)\u201d, also \nrecognizing the continued need for further research; \n \n40. Commend the progress achieved in several regions of the world as a result of \nimplementing research which has led to massive and rapid scaling-up of pre-exposure \nprophylaxis and the use of post-exposure prophylaxis, in conjunction with treatment \nas prevention, resulting in the rapid reductions in the number of new HIV infections;  \n__________________ \n \n15  A comprehensive package for the prevention, treatment and care of HIV among intravenous drug \nusers should include the following nine interventions: (i) needle and syringe programmes; \n(ii) opioid substitution therapy and other drug dependence treatment; (iii) HIV testing and \ncounselling; (iv) antiretroviral therapy; (v) prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted \ninfections; (vi) condom programmes for intravenous drug users and their sexual partners; \n(vii) targeted information, education and communication for intravenous drug users and their \nsexual partners; (viii) vaccination, diagnosis and treatment of viral hepatitis; and (ix) prevention, \ndiagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. \n\nA/RES/75/284 \nPolitical Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Ending Inequalities and \nGetting on Track to End AIDS by 2030\n \n21-07531\n8/19 \n \n \n41. Welcome that over 26 million people living with HIV are on antiretroviral \ntherapy \u2013 a number that has more than tripled since 2010 \u2013 but note that, despite this \nprogress, 12 million people living with HIV still do not have access to treatment, \nespecially in Africa, and that these 12 million people are prevented from accessing \ntreatment owing to inequalities, multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and \nstructural barriers; \n \n42. Reaffirm that access to safe, effective, equitable and affordable medicines \nand commodities for all, without discrimination, is fundamental to the full realization \nof the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical \nand mental health, yet note with grave concern the high number of people without \naccess to medicine and that the sustainability of providing lifelong safe, effective and \naffordable HIV treatment continues to be threatened by factors such as poverty and \nunderscore that access to medicines would save millions of lives; \n \n43. Note that tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death among people \nliving with HIV and that less than half of tuberculosis cases among people living with \nHIV are diagnosed and treated appropriately, and notes the necessity to increase \nfinancing for research and development of new tools for tuberculosis prevention, \ndiagnosis and treatment, including for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, for people \nliving with HIV, as well as in the context of COVID-19;  \n \n44. Note that viral hepatitis coinfection with HIV, including mortality due to \nviral hepatitis coinfection, is reported across populations at higher risk of HIV, \nespecially among people who inject drugs;  \n \n45. Note that people living with HIV are at substantially higher risk for many \ntypes of cancer, including those caused by the human papillomavirus, that women \nliving with HIV are about six times more likely to develop cervical cancer and that \nanal cancer rates are substantially higher for men and women living with HIV than \ntheir HIV-negative peers;  \n \n46. Recognize that the HIV response has transformed global health responses, \nstrengthened health systems and contributed to socioeconomic development in many \ncountries;  \n \n47. Recognize the resilience and innovation demonstrated by communities \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic in reaching affected people with safe, affordable and \neffective services, including COVID-19 testing and vaccination, HIV prevention, \ntesting and treatment and other health and social services;  \n \n48. Welcome that HIV-related investments in leadership, expertise, research \nand development, community responses, large cadres of community health workers, \nenhanced health information and laboratory systems and strengthened procurement \nand supply chain management systems now play important roles in the response to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including the development of COVID-19 vaccines;  \n \n49. Note that, while international investment in the COVID-19 response has \nbeen unprecedented but nonetheless inadequate, many national responses to COVID-19 \nhave demonstrated the potential and urgency for greater investment in pandemic \nresponses, underscoring the imperative of increasing investments for public health \nsystems, including responses to HIV and other diseases moving forward; \n \n50. Welcome the steady increase in domestic HIV investment and note the \nimportance of public policies, finance and capacity-building to spur even greater \ndomestic resource mobilization, including through public-private partnerships and \ninnovative financing mechanisms, and for enhanced revenue administration through \nmodernized, progressive tax systems, improved tax policy and more efficient tax \ncollection;  \n\nPolitical Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Ending Inequalities and \nGetting on Track to End AIDS by 2030 \nA/RES/75/284\n \n9/19\n21-07531 \n \n \n51. Express concern over the stagnation and decline in international resources \nfor the HIV response, reaffirm the importance of international public finance as a \ncomplement to domestic resources, reiterate that the fulfilment of all official \ndevelopment assistance targets remains crucial and recall the respective commitment \nof many developed countries to official development assistance, including 0.7 per \ncent of gross national income provided as official development assistance, with 0.15 \nto 0.2 per cent allocated to least developed countries; \n \n52. Recognize that there are still many gaps in financing for HIV and AIDS \nand the need to further encourage technology transfer on mutually agreed terms, \nimprove access to medicines in developing countries and scale up capacity-building \nand research and development, including local production of pharmaceutical \nproducts; \n \n53. Underscore the importance of enhanced international cooperation to \nsupport efforts of Member States to achieve health goals, including the target of \nending the AIDS epidemic by 2030, implement universal access to health-care \nservices and address health challenges;  \n \n54. Recognize that each country faces specific challenges to achieving \nsustainable development, and we underscore the special challenges facing the most \nvulnerable countries, in particular African countries, least developed countries, \nlandlocked developing countries and small island developing States, as well as the \nspecific challenges facing middle-income countries;  \n \n55. Note with alarm that if we do not share responsibility to increase and \nequitably allocate resources and massively scale up coverage, we will not end the \nAIDS epidemic by 2030; \n \n \n \nCommitments \n \n \n \nEnding inequalities and engaging stakeholders to end AIDS \n \n \n56. Commit to reducing annual new HIV infections to under 370,000 and \nannual AIDS-related deaths to under 250,000 by 2025, and eliminating all forms of \nHIV-related stigma and discrimination;  \n \n57. Pledge to end all inequalities faced by people living with, at risk of and \naffected by HIV and by communities, and to end inequalities within and among \ncountries, which are barriers to ending AIDS; \n \n58. Commit to reinforce global, regional, national and subnational HIV \nresponses through enhanced engagement with a broad range of stakeholders, \nincluding regional and subregional organizations and initiatives, people living with, \nat risk of and affected by HIV, key populations, indigenous peoples, local \ncommunities, women and men, girls and boys, including adolescents, young people \nand older persons, in diverse situations and conditions, refugees, migrants, internally \ndisplaced persons, political and community leaders, parliamentarians, judges and \ncourts, communities, families, faith-based organizations, religious leaders, scientists, \nhealth professionals, donors, the philanthropic community, the workforce, including \nmigrant workers, the private sector, media and civil society, and community-led \norganizations, women\u2019s organizations, feminist groups, persons with disabilities and \ntheir representative organizations, youth-led organizations, national human rights \ninstitutions, where they exist, and human rights defenders, and relevant United \nNations entities and other key international partners such as the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; \n \n59.
