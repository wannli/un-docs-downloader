Also reaffirms that the realization of the right to development is essential \nto the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which \nregards all human rights as universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, \nplaces the human person at the centre of development and recognizes that, while \ndevelopment facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, a lack of development may \nnot be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human rights; \n \n17.

Expresses concern about the increasing cases of human rights violations \nand abuses by some transnational corporations and other business enterprises, \nunderlines the need to ensure that appropriate protection, justice and remedies are \nprovided to the victims of human rights violations and abuses resulting from their \nactivities, and underscores the fact that these entities must contribute to the means of \nimplementation for the realization of the right to development; \n \n25. Reaffirms the need for an international environment that is conducive to \nthe realization of the right to development; \n \n26.

Reaffirms that, while globalization offers both opportunities and challenges, \nthe process of globalization remains deficient in achieving the objectives of integrating \nall countries into a globalized world, stresses the need for policies and measures at \nthe national and global levels to respond to the challenges and opportunities of \nglobalization if this process is to be made fully inclusive and equitable, and \nrecognizes that globalization has brought disparities between and within countries \nand that issues such as trade and trade liberalization, the transfer of technology, \ninfrastructure development and market access should be managed effectively in order \nto mitigate the challenges of poverty and underdevelopment and to make the right to \ndevelopment a reality for everyone; \n \n28. Recognizes that, despite continuous efforts on the part of the international \ncommunity, the gap between developed and developing countries remains unacceptably \nwide, that most of the developing countries continue to face difficulties in \nparticipating in the globalization process and that many risk being marginalized and \neffectively excluded from its benefits; \n \n29. Expresses its deep concern, in this regard, about the negative impact on \nthe realization of the right to development owing to the further aggravation of the \neconomic and social situation, in particular of developing countries, as a result of the \neffects of international energy, food and financial crises, as well as the increasing \nchallenges posed by global climate change and the loss of biodiversity, which have \nincreased vulnerabilities and inequalities and have adversely affected development \ngains, in particular in developing countries; \n \n30.

Urges developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete \nefforts towards meeting the targets of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for \nofficial development assistance to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of \ntheir gross national product to the least developed countries, and encourages developing \ncountries to build on the progress achieved in ensuring that official development \nassistance is used effectively to help to meet development goals and targets; \n \n33. Recognizes the need to address market access for developing countries, \nincluding in the sectors of agriculture, services and non-agricultural products, in \nparticular those of interest to developing countries; \n \n34. Calls once again for the implementation of a desirable pace of meaningful \ntrade liberalization, including in areas under negotiation in the World Trade \nOrganization, the implementation of commitments on implementation-related issues \nand concerns, a review of special and differential treatment provisions, with a view \nto strengthening them and making them more precise, effective and operational, the \navoidance of new forms of protectionism, and capacity-building and technical \nassistance for developing countries as important issues in making progress towards \nthe effective implementation of the right to development; \n \n35.

Also recognizes that good governance and the rule of law at the national \nlevel assist all States in the promotion and protection of human rights, including the \nright to development, and agrees on the value of the ongoing efforts being made by \nStates to identify and strengthen good governance practices, including transparent, \nresponsible, accountable and participatory government, that are responsive and \nappropriate to their needs and aspirations, including in the context of agreed \npartnership approaches to development, capacity-building and technical assistance; \n \n37. Further recognizes the important role and the rights of women and the \napplication of a gender perspective as a cross-cutting issue in the process of realizing the \nright to development, and notes in particular the positive relationship between the \neducation of women and their equal participation in the civil, cultural, economic, political \nand social activities of the community and the promotion of the right to development; \n \n38.
