Promoting investments for sustainable development \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nReaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled \u201cTransforming \nour world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d, in which it adopted a \ncomprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative \nSustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for \nthe full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating \npoverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest \nglobal challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its \ncommitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions \u2013 \neconomic, social and environmental \u2013 in a balanced and integrated manner, and to \nbuilding upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking \nto address their unfinished business,  \n \nReaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa \nAction Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, \nwhich is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports \nand complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with \nconcrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to \naddress the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels \nfor sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity,  \n \nNoting with great concern the severe negative impact on human health, safety \nand well-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as \nthe severe disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives \nand livelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the \npandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals by designing and implementing sustainable and inclusive \nrecovery strategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 \n\nA/RES/78/141 \nPromoting investments for sustainable development\n \n23-25933\n2/10 \n \nAgenda for Sustainable Development and to help to reduce the risk of and build \nresilience to future shocks, crises and pandemics, including by strengthening health \nsystems and achieving universal health coverage, and recognizing that equitable and \ntimely access for all to safe, quality, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, \ntherapeutics and diagnostics are an essential part of a global response based on unity, \nsolidarity, renewed multilateral cooperation and the principle of leaving no one behind, \n \nRecalling its resolutions 74/199 of 19 December 2019, 75/207 of 21 December \n2020, 76/197 of 17 December 2021 and 77/155 of 14 December 2022,  \n \nUnderscoring that international project finance is increasingly important for \nSustainable Development Goals and climate change investment and that the strong \ngrowth performance of international project finance can be explained by favourable \nfinancing conditions, infrastructure stimulus and significant interest on the part of \nfinancial market investors to participate in projects that require multiple financiers, \nrecognizing that international project finance can enable Governments to leverage \npublic investment through private finance participation, and noting that developing \ncountries are disadvantaged in this regard that efforts to enhance private finance \nmobilization in developing countries are particularly crucial,  \n \nEmphasizing that, in 2021, the bulk of tracked climate change investments is \nconcentrated in renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects, that international \nprivate investment in climate change sectors is directed almost exclusively to \nmitigation, with only 5 per cent going to adaptation projects, and that more than 60 \nper cent is invested in developed countries, where 85 per cent of projects are purely \nprivately financed, whereas almost half of the projects in developing countries require \nsome form of public sector participation, while noting that investments in adaptation \nare underreported,  \n \nNoting with concern that the progress on most of the Sustainable Development \nGoals is either moving much too slowly or has regressed below the 2015 baseline and \nthat, in the face of current multiple crises, years of sustainable development gains are \nbeing reversed, as millions of people, particularly in developing countries, have fallen \ninto poverty, hunger and malnutrition are becoming more prevalent, and humanitarian \nneeds are rising,  \n \nHighlighting the fact that finance and investment support is needed not only for \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation, but is equally important in other \nSustainable Development Goal investment areas,  \n \nHighlighting also that the second highest Sustainable Development Goal \ninvestment gap is in water and sanitation, with a growing need for sustainable and \ninnovative investments in water and sanitation to ensure progress on the \nimplementation of water-related goals and targets,  \n \nNoting the urgent need to achieve zero hunger, end all forms of malnutrition, \neradicate extreme poverty and ensure rapid, inclusive and sustainable income growth \nin developing countries by adopting the right policies and step up investments, \nresearch and the sharing of technology on mutually agreed terms, with the \nachievement of all Sustainable Development Goals as the ultimate objective,  \n \nNoting with concern that the global environment changed dramatically in 2022, \nwith rising geopolitical tensions and conflicts and the current multiple crises, which \nincreased pressure on food, energy and finance, affecting many countries around the \nworld, increasing investor uncertainty and putting significant downward pressure on \nglobal foreign direct investment in 2022,  \n \nNoting that the crises underscore the imperative to embed long-term and risk-\ninformed thinking and sustainability into corporate and investment practices, and \n\nPromoting investments for sustainable development \nA/RES/78/141\n \n3/10\n23-25933 \n \nstressing that in order to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 crisis all \nstakeholders will have to work in tandem, at the same time, while the global fight \nagainst the pandemic and climate change has accelerated the momentum of \nsustainability finance and investment, with the value of sustainability-themed \ninvestment products in global capital markets growing fivefold in the past five years, \namounting to 5.8 trillion United States dollars in 2022, recognizing that the vast \nmajority of these funds have been invested in developed countries, leaving developing \ncountry investment opportunities significantly lacking, and that it is critical to scale \nup sustainable investments in all countries, especially in developing countries, \nincluding countries in special situations,  \n \nEmphasizing that success in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and \nthe eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions depends on the creation of \nenabling environments at all levels, which can be supported by a reformed \ninternational financial architecture, to strengthen investments towards activities that \npromote the Goals, \n \nRecognizing that a revitalized global partnership will facilitate an intensive \nglobal engagement in support of the implementation of all of the Goals and their \ntargets, bringing together Governments, civil society, the private sector, academia, \nthe United Nations system and other actors and mobilizing all available resources,  \n \nRecalling that, in the 2030 Agenda, it was acknowledged that the \nimplementation of sustainable development will depend on the active engagement of \nboth the public and private sectors and other relevant international organizations, \nincluding international financial institutions and multilateral development banks,  \n \nNoting the convening of the eighth World Investment Forum of the United \nNations Conference on Trade and Development in Abu Dhabi from 16 to 20 October \n2023, as well as the eighth Sustainable Development Goals Investment Fair, held in \nNew York from 18 to 29 April 2023,  \n \nNoting also the work of the United Nations in the area of investments for \nsustainable development, and taking note of the World Investment Report 2023 and \nthe SDG Investment Trends Monitor of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment, the Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2023, the \nSustainable Development Goals Report 2023 and the outcome document of the 2023 \nEconomic and Social Council forum on financing for development follow-up,1  \n \nNoting further all initiatives at the global, regional and local levels that are \naimed at scaling up the mobilization of public and private finance towards investing \nfor the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in its three dimensions and deepening \ninternational cooperation,  \n \nNoting the potential of impact investment for the financing of sustainable \ndevelopment in supporting national development policies, plans, priorities and needs \nin the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,  \n \nRecognizing that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require a shift \ntowards long-term investment horizons, including early-stage financing, in this regard \nencouraging investors to take measures to incentivize greater long-term investment and \nearly-stage financing, and recognizing that international public and private finance for \ndevelopment complemented by other innovative financing mechanisms, including \nblended finance, can play an important role in upscaling our collective efforts to cover \nthe finance needs to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,  \n__________________ \n \n1  E/FFDF/2023/3. \n\nA/RES/78/141 \nPromoting investments for sustainable development\n \n23-25933\n4/10 \n \n \nRecognizing also that entrepreneurship can help achieve the 2030 Agenda, \nunderlining the importance of advancing sustainable consumption and production \npatterns, and stressing the need to promote sustainable and innovative financing \nopportunities and mechanisms to unlock new capital for sustainable investment and \nupscale sustainable business models, with a special focus on micro-, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises,  \n \nEmphasizing that national development efforts need to be supported by an \nenabling international economic environment, including coherent and mutually \nsupporting world trade, monetary and financial systems, and strengthened and \nenhanced global economic governance, and in this regard stressing that the likelihood \nof an increase in global foreign direct investment is further tempered by a series of \nrisk factors,  \n \nEmphasizing also that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals is not \npossible without private and public investment, including long-term foreign investment, \nwhich can be mobilized when there is an enabling environment at all levels,  \n \nRecognizing the importance of corporate sustainability, including reporting on \nenvironmental, social and governance impacts, as appropriate, to help to ensure \ntransparency and accountability and avoid practices that counteract efforts to achieve \nthe Sustainable Development Goals,  \n \nReaffirming the commitment to significantly increase investments to close the \ngender gap and strengthen support for institutions in relation to gender equality and \nthe empowerment of all women and girls at the global, regional and national levels,  \n \nNoting with concern that investments critical to achieving the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals remain underfunded, and recognizing that additional public and \nprivate investment and financing at the national and international levels will be \nrequired to meet the large investment needs, associated with gaps, for achieving the \nGoals, including in quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure to support \neconomic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and \nequitable access for all,  \n \nRecognizing that international public finance, including official development \nassistance, is important to the efforts of developing countries to achieve the \nSustainable Development Goals, including through its capacity to catalyse additional \nresource mobilization from other sources, public and private, as it can support \nimproved tax collection and help to strengthen domestic enabling environments and \nbuild essential public services,  \n \nEmphasizing that the call for the contribution by the private sector to \nSustainable Development Goals financing is not a substitute for but rather an \nimportant complement to public financing,  \n \nUnderlining that, in order to support the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, both public and private finance should be sustainable and \nprovided at affordable terms,  \n \nEmphasizing the need to continue to scale up investments in climate action, \nincluding by making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse \ngas emissions and climate-resilient development, in line with the Paris Agreement,2 \nand reiterating the need to accelerate the transfer and deployment of environmentally \nsound and low-emission technologies on favourable terms, including on concessional \nand preferential terms, and mutually agreed terms, \n__________________ \n \n2  See FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21, annex. \n\nPromoting investments for sustainable development \nA/RES/78/141\n \n5/10\n23-25933 \n \n \nNoting that global foreign direct investment flows declined by 12 per cent in \n2022, to 1.3 trillion dollars, and that although foreign direct investment in developing \ncountries increased marginally, it however declined considerably in Africa from the \n80 billion dollars recorded in 2021 to 45 billion dollars in 2022, growth was \nconcentrated in a few large emerging economies, while inflows in many smaller \ndeveloping countries were stagnant and foreign direct investment to the least \ndeveloped countries declined, \n \nNoting also that many developing countries continue to struggle to attract \nsignificant amounts of foreign direct investment beyond the extractive sector, 31 \ndeveloping countries, including 11 least developed countries, have not yet registered \na single utility-sized international investment project in renewables or other energy \ntransition sectors since 2015, indicating that financing and, where adequate, \nde-risking support is especially crucial in most developing countries, \n \nStressing that transparency and inclusion in the international financial, monetary \nand trading systems and solid institutions at all levels and the design and \nimplementation of policies, including capital market regulations, where appropriate, \nthat promote incentives along the investment chain, that are aligned with long-term \nperformance and sustainability indicators and that reduce volatility, are essential for \ninvestment promotion, sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and \nemployment creation that goes hand-in-hand with technical education and vocational \ntraining in developing countries, and in this regard stressing the need for further \ninternational support as well as competitive investment climates at all levels for \ndeveloping countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,  \n \nRecognizing that socially, economically and environmentally responsible, \naccountable and sustainable national and international private business activity, \ninvestment, entrepreneurship and innovation, including equal access for all women \nand youth, are major drivers of productivity, inclusive economic growth and job \ncreation, in order to leave no one behind, \n \nNoting the role of the United Nations Development Programme Istanbul \nInternational Centre for Private Sector in Development in its engagement with the \nprivate sector to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and promote inclusive \nmarkets and sustainable business development,  \n \nRecognizing the importance of investments in technological industry and the \ndigital economy to promote connectivity and digital partnerships, and that \ndevelopment and transfer of technology on mutually agreed terms is a powerful driver \nof sustainable development and that there is a need to foster linkages between \nmultinational companies and the domestic public and private sectors, as appropriate, \nto facilitate technology development and transfer on mutually agreed terms, \n \n1. \nEmphasizes that promoting investments in value addition and in the \nprocessing of natural resources and productive diversification ensures more inclusive \nand sustainable development, and in this regard encourages accelerated national \nefforts and the strengthening of international cooperation in areas that support \npolicies and programmes that increase public and private, domestic and international \ninvestments for structural change in the economies of developing countries; \n \n2. \nEncourages the promotion of sustainable and innovative financing \nopportunities and mechanisms to unlock new capital for sustainable investment and \nupscale sustainable business models, with a special focus on micro-, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises;  \n \n3. \nNotes with concern that many of the least developed countries and small \nisland developing States continue to be largely sidelined by foreign direct investment \n\nA/RES/78/141 \nPromoting investments for sustainable development\n \n23-25933\n6/10 \n \nthat could help to diversify their economies, despite improvements in some of their \ninvestment climates;  \n \n4. \nAlso notes with concern the gap in access to capital and adequate support \nservices for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular for businesses \nled by women, young entrepreneurs and persons with disabilities, and recognizes that \nfinancial markets as well as business support organizations can be powerful vehicles \nfor sustainable and inclusive economic growth and poverty alleviation, including \nwhen they support businesses that have a sustainable development impact and when \naccess to credit is inclusive across all segments of an economy;  \n \n5. \nRecognizes that foreign direct investment can have positive spillovers, \nsuch as know-how and technology, including through establishing linkages with \ndomestic suppliers, as well as encouraging the integration of local enterprises, in \nparticular micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, into \nregional and global value chains;  \n \n6. \nEmphasizes that foreign direct investment may have different impacts on \nSustainable Development Goals, and underlines the need to strengthen the alignment \nof foreign direct investment with national policies and sustainable development \nstrategies and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,3 and invites States \npreparing integrated national financing frameworks to include and implement plans \nfor mobilizing and aligning private finance with national development plans;  \n \n7. \nRecognizes the need to develop and strengthen policies to better align \nprivate sector incentives with Sustainable Development Goals, and acknowledges that \nsustainable finance taxonomies can be a helpful tool in creating more transparency \nand can thus incentivize the private sector to adopt and invest in sustainable practices \nand foster long-term quality investment;  \n \n8. \nEncourages national and international efforts to integrate sustainability into \nthe financial system and thus to further reorient capital flows towards investments that \nare sustainable from an economic, social and environmental perspective;  \n \n9. \nCalls for increased foreign direct investments, particularly in developing \ncountries, which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and current \nmultiple crises, to meet the 4 trillion dollar Sustainable Development Goal investment \ngap in developing countries, while recognizing the key role of foreign direct \ninvestments for economic growth and development and that foreign direct \ninvestments can reduce inequalities and can help commodity-dependent countries to \ntransition to manufacturing activities and other higher-value-added activities;  \n \n10. Encourages financial actors at all levels to work towards the establishment \nof inclusive, representative and responsible financial practices, including practices \nrelated to transparency, disclosure and standards, and further encourages the efforts \nof all actors to reduce the existing and prevent further fragmentation of reporting and \ndisclosure standards, as appropriate; \n \n11. Welcomes the progress made by many countries in strengthening the \nenabling environment for private sector businesses and investments, but notes that \nmore can be done to create competitive business and investment climates, including \nby increasing efforts to combat corruption, promoting market transparency, \nimproving access to market information and easing the process of setting up \nbusinesses, that are well placed to attract private sector investment and participation \nin support of sustainable development;  \n__________________ \n \n3  Resolution 70/1. \n\nPromoting investments for sustainable development \nA/RES/78/141\n \n7/10\n23-25933 \n \n \n12. Reiterates that greater gender equality in the distribution of economic \nresources can provide the means for women to generate income and creates positive \nmultiplier effects for the achievement of inclusive, equitable and sustainable economic \ngrowth, and in this regard reiterates the need for targeted actions and investments;  \n \n13. Recognizes the importance of private sector engagement with national, \ninternational and intergovernmental organizations, Member States and other relevant \nstakeholders, as appropriate, in their efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development \nGoals, in an effective, accountable and consultative manner;  \n \n14. \nAcknowledges the importance of combining international, multilateral \ndevelopment banks and government stakes in public-private partnerships to reduce the \ncost of capital, and the need for a shift in the lending priorities of multilateral development \nbanks towards better leverage their funds, to attract greater volumes of private finance \ninto developing countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; \n \n15. Notes the importance of sustainable corporate practices, including \nintegrating environmental, social and governance factors into company reporting, as \nappropriate, with countries deciding on the appropriate balance of voluntary and \nmandatory rules, and encourages businesses to adopt principles for responsible \nbusiness and investing;  \n \n16.

Recognizes the challenges faced by developing countries in adopting new \ninternational sustainability reporting standards, leading to increased needs for \ncapacity-building, especially for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, and \nwelcomes in this context the work of the Intergovernmental Working Group of \nExperts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting for the promotion of \nsustainability reporting in developing countries;  \n \n18. Calls upon Member States to reduce tensions and other risk factors and to \nfoster environments that are conducive to scaling up long-term and sustainable \ninvestments, characterized by, inter alia, open, transparent and non-discriminatory \ninvestment policies;  \n \n19. Notes with concern the growing number of slum dwellers and the adverse \neffects on their health, safety and livelihood opportunities, and in this regard \nencourages targeted investments at all levels to ensure affordable and adequate \nhousing as well as sustained investment for Sustainable Development Goal targets in \nthese sectors by 2030; \n \n20. Emphasizes that the private sector can contribute to the achievement of the \n2030 Agenda in many ways, including through applying creative and innovative \nsolutions to solving sustainable development challenges, the alignment of its business \nmodels with the Sustainable Development Goals, and supporting the efforts of the \npublic sector in, inter alia, disaster risk reduction, climate action and skills \ndevelopment, in accordance with national plans and policies, and in this regard \n\nA/RES/78/141 \nPromoting investments for sustainable development\n \n23-25933\n8/10 \n \nencourages further policy development and capacity-building on de-risking \ninvestments in all countries to mobilize financing; \n \n21. Welcomes the growing interest among investors in taking sustainability \nissues into account in their investment decisions, but acknowledges that further work \nis needed to analyse, monitor and measure its contribution to the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and maximize its positive development impact;  \n \n22. Acknowledges that reducing disaster risk, as outlined in the Sendai \nFramework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030,4 and the political declaration of \nthe high-level meeting on its midterm review,5 is a cost-effective investment in \npreventing future losses, encourages Member States to develop standards, legislation \nand regulations, as appropriate, for disaster risk-informed public and private sector \ninvestments, including on risk disclosure in investments and transactions, and to \nensure that pipeline and bankable projects include multi-hazard and other measures \nthat assess, prevent and mitigate risks, including in infrastructure and the real estate \nsector, and in this regard encourages Member States to routinely conduct stress testing \nof infrastructure systems;  \n \n23. Encourages efforts to align infrastructure plans to disaster risk reduction \nstrategies, promoting multi-hazard disaster risk assessments as a prerequisite for \ninfrastructure, housing and real estate investments in all sectors and stress-testing of \ncritical infrastructure systems, with a view to safeguarding gains in sustainable \ndevelopment; \n \n24. Encourages Member States to achieve sustainable development in its three \ndimensions in an innovative, integrated, transparent, inclusive and equitable manner, \nwhich requires sufficient, sustainable and predictable investment through both the \npublic and the private sectors;  \n \n25.

Recognizes the growing momentum around sustainable investment and \nfinance, including through investments in Sustainable Development Goal bonds, and \ninvites private companies to adopt sustainable practices that foster long-term value;  \n \n27. Acknowledges with great concern the devastating economic impact of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, which undermines countries\u2019 ability to implement the goals \nand targets of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement and threatens to upend the \nprogress made recently in promoting investment in the Sustainable Development \nGoals, notes the role of multi-stakeholder partnerships, including with the public and \nprivate sectors, to foster strategic investment in the Sustainable Development Goals, \nespecially in areas that could contribute more to combat COVID-19 and its resulting \nsocioeconomic impacts, including through innovative financing, inter alia, in health-\ncare systems, including universal health coverage; food security, including \nagricultural and food production and related supply chains; digital connectivity; job \ncreation; sustainable and quality infrastructure development and growth in \nproductivity; as well as to ensure an environment-responsive approach to COVID-19 \nrecovery and to counter the shortfall in investment that the pandemic entails, calls \nupon all stakeholders to cooperate in order to enhance resilience and sustainability in \nglobal supply chains and strengthen international investment, including by aligning \ninvestments with the 2030 Agenda, and encourages cooperation to facilitate cross-\n__________________ \n \n4  Resolution 69/283, annex II. \n \n5  Resolution 77/289, annex. \n\nPromoting investments for sustainable development \nA/RES/78/141\n \n9/10\n23-25933 \n \nborder travel of persons for essential purposes, without undermining efforts to prevent \nthe spread of the virus;  \n \n28. Stresses the need to take stock of public and private initiatives to measure \ninvestment impacts on the Sustainable Development Goals, identify their similarities \nand differences, and lay out potential gaps;  \n \n29. Welcomes in this regard the request, in the outcome document of the 2019 \nEconomic and Social Council forum on financing for development follow-up, to the \nInter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development to further its analysis on the \nimpact and metrics for measurement of the contribution of private sector investments \nand instruments to the Sustainable Development Goals at the global level,6 and \nencourages international support for Member States, according to national \ncircumstances and priorities, to voluntarily develop practical tools on measuring and \ncollecting timely and reliable data on the private sector contribution towards the \nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals at the national level, as \nappropriate;  \n \n30. Emphasizes that international public finance plays an important role in \ncomplementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically and \nthat official development assistance, as a critical source for development finance, \nhelps developing countries to secure sufficient public resources to invest in sectors \nthat could accelerate the delivery of the transformational ambition of the 2030 \nAgenda, and notes in this regard the need to intensify efforts to meet respective \ncommitments, focusing the most concessional resources on those with the greatest \nneeds and least ability to mobilize other resources;  \n \n31. Notes the potential of blended finance, including its ability to crowd in, \nleverage or catalyse additional financing, and stresses that projects should be aligned \nwith national priorities, have long-lasting development impact and be in the public \ninterest, including those in vulnerable situations, while recognizing that, for different \nSustainable Development Goal investment areas, different types of finance may \nrepresent the most effective financing modalities;  \n \n32. Encourages Member States to promote shareholder and consumer \nengagement that may encourage companies to take into account consumers\u2019 \nsustainability preferences;  \n \n33. Calls upon development partners to continue to support efforts to \nstrengthen policy frameworks to incentivize finance for productive investment, \nincluding building capacity to access available, additional and sustainable sources of \nfinancing, including concessional finance, particularly in the least developed \ncountries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States and \nAfrican countries, and taking into account the specific challenges faced by middle-\nincome countries;  \n \n34. Notes the policy proposals put forward by the United Nations Conference \non Trade and Development in its World Investment Report 2022: International Tax \nReform and Sustainable Investment, in particular that the international community \nshould support developing countries, especially in Africa and the least developed \ncountries, including through scaling up technical assistance to take advantage of \ninternational tax reforms, and calls upon the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment to work in collaboration with multiple stakeholders to help developing \ncountries to avail themselves of these recommendations;  \n__________________ \n \n6  See E/FFDF/2019/3. \n\nA/RES/78/141 \nPromoting investments for sustainable development\n \n23-25933\n10/10 \n \n \n35.
