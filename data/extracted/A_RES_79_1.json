The Pact for the Future \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly \n \nAdopts the following Pact for the Future and its annexes: \n \n \n \n The Pact for the Future \n \n \n1. \nWe, the Heads of State and Government, representing the peoples of the world, \nhave gathered at United Nations Headquarters to protect the needs and interests of \npresent and future generations through the actions in this Pact for the Future. \n2. \nWe are at a time of profound global transformation. We are confronted by rising \ncatastrophic and existential risks, many caused by the choices we make. Fellow \nhuman beings are enduring terrible suffering. If we do not change course, we risk \ntipping into a future of persistent crisis and breakdown. \n3. \nYet this is also a moment of hope and opportunity. Global transformation is a \nchance for renewal and progress grounded in our common humanity. Advances in \nknowledge, science, technology and innovation could deliver a breakthrough to a \nbetter and more sustainable future for all. The choice is ours. \n4. \nWe believe that there is a path to a brighter future for all of humanity, including \nthose living in poverty and vulnerable situations. Through the actions we take today, \nwe resolve to set ourselves on that path, striving for a world that is safe, peaceful, \njust, equal, inclusive, sustainable and prosperous, a world in which well-being, \nsecurity and dignity and a healthy planet are assured for all humanity. \n5. \nThis will require a recommitment to international cooperation based on respect \nfor international law, without which we can neither manage the risks nor seize the \nopportunities that we face. This is not an option but a necessity. Our challenges are \ndeeply interconnected and far exceed the capacity of any single State alone. They can \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n2/56 \n \nonly be addressed collectively, through strong and sustained international cooperation \nguided by trust and solidarity for the benefit of all and harnessing the power of those \nwho can contribute from all sectors and generations.  \n6. \nWe recognize that the multilateral system and its institutions, with the United \nNations and its Charter at the centre, must be strengthened to keep pace with a \nchanging world. They must be fit for the present and the future \u2013 effective and \ncapable, prepared for the future, just, democratic, equitable and representative of \ntoday\u2019s world, inclusive, interconnected and financially stable.  \n7. \nToday, we pledge a new beginning in multilateralism. The actions in this Pact \naim to ensure that the United Nations and other key multilateral institutions can \ndeliver a better future for people and planet, enabling us to fulfil our existing \ncommitments while rising to new and emerging challenges and opportunities.  \n8. \nWe reaffirm our unwavering commitment to act in accordance with international \nlaw, including the Charter of the United Nations and its purposes and principles.  \n9. \nWe also reaffirm that the three pillars of the United Nations \u2013 sustainable \ndevelopment, peace and security, and human rights \u2013 are equally important, \ninterlinked and mutually reinforcing. We cannot have one without the others.  \n10. We recognize that sustainable development in all its three dimensions is a \ncentral goal in itself and that its achievement, leaving no one behind, is and always \nwill be a central objective of multilateralism. We reaffirm our enduring commitment \nto the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development1 and its Sustainable Development \nGoals. We will urgently accelerate progress towards achieving the Goals, including \nthrough concrete political steps and mobilizing significant additional financing from \nall sources for sustainable development, with special attention to the needs of those \nin special situations and creating opportunities for young people. Poverty in all its \nforms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, remains the greatest global \nchallenge and its eradication is an indispensable requirement for sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n11. \nClimate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, with adverse \nimpacts that are disproportionately felt by developing countries, especially those that \nare particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. We commit to \naccelerate meeting our obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change2 and the Paris Agreement.3 \n12. To live up to our foundational promise to protect succeeding generations from \nthe scourge of war, we must abide by international law, including the Charter, and \nmake full use of all the instruments and mechanisms set out in the Charter, \nintensifying our use of diplomacy, committing to resolve our disputes peacefully, \nrefraining from the threat or use of force, or acts of aggression, respecting each other\u2019s \nsovereignty and territorial integrity, upholding the principles of political \nindependence and self-determination, as well as strengthening accountability and \nending impunity. With challenges and risks to international peace and security taking \non more dangerous forms, in traditional and new domains, our efforts must keep pace. \n13. Every commitment in this Pact is fully consistent and aligned with international \nlaw, including human rights law. We reaffirm the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights4 and the fundamental freedoms enshrined therein. The implementation of the \nPact will enhance the full enjoyment of human rights and dignity for all, which is a \n__________________ \n \n1 Resolution 70/1. \n \n2  United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1771, No. 30822. \n \n3 Adopted under the UNFCCC in FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21. \n \n4  Resolution 217 A (III). \n\nThe Pact for the Future \nA/RES/79/1\n \n3/56\n24-16433 \n \nkey goal. We will respect, protect, promote and fulfil all human rights, recognizing \ntheir universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness, and we will be \nunequivocal in what we stand for and uphold: freedom from fear and freedom from \nwant for all. \n14. We recognize that our efforts to redress injustice and to reduce inequalities \nwithin and between countries to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies cannot \nsucceed unless we step up our efforts to promote tolerance, embrace diversity and \ncombat all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, \nxenophobia and related intolerance and all their abhorrent and contemporary forms \nand manifestations.  \n15. None of our goals can be achieved without the full, safe, equal and meaningful \nparticipation and representation of all women in political and economic life. We \nreaffirm our commitment to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, 5 to \naccelerating our efforts to achieve gender equality, women\u2019s participation and the \nempowerment of all women and girls in all domains and to eliminating all forms of \ndiscrimination and violence against women and girls. \n16. We reaffirm our pledge, made on the occasion of the seventy-fifth anniversary \nof the United Nations, to reinvigorate global action to ensure the future we want and \nto effectively respond to current and future challenges, in partnership with all relevant \nstakeholders. We recognize that the well-being of current and future generations and \nthe sustainability of our planet rests on our willingness to take action. To that end, in \nthis Pact we commit to 56 actions in the areas of sustainable development and \nfinancing for development, international peace and security, science, technology and \ninnovation and digital cooperation, youth and future generations, and transforming \nglobal governance.  \n17. We will advance implementation of these actions through relevant, mandated \nintergovernmental processes, where they exist. We will review the overall \nimplementation of the Pact at the beginning of the eighty-third session of the General \nAssembly through a meeting at the level of Heads of State and Government. We are \nconfident that, by then, we will be well on course towards the better and more \nsustainable future we want for ourselves, our children and all the generations who \nwill come after us. \n \n \n \nI. \nSustainable development and financing for development \n \n18. In 2015, we resolved to free the human race from the tyranny of poverty, hunger \nand want and to heal and secure our planet. We promised that we would leave no one \nbehind. We have made some progress, but the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals is in peril. Progress on most of the Goals is either moving too \nslowly or has regressed below the 2015 baseline. Years of sustainable development \ngains are being reversed. Poverty, hunger and inequality have increased. Human \nrights are under threat, and we run the risk of leaving millions of people behind. \nClimate change, biodiversity loss, desertification and sand and dust storms, pollution \nand other environmental challenges pose serious risks to our natural environment and \nour prospects for development. \n19. We will not accept a future in which dignity and opportunity are denied to half \nthe world\u2019s population or become the sole preserve of those with privilege and wealth. \nWe reaffirm that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is our overarching \nroad map for achieving sustainable development in all three of its dimensions, \novercoming the multiple, interlinked crises that we face and securing a better future \n__________________ \n \n5 Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 4\u201315 September 1995 (United \nNations publication, Sales No. E.96.IV.13), chap. I, resolution 1, annexes I and II. \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n4/56 \n \nfor present and future generations. We recognize that eradicating poverty in all its \nforms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and \nan indispensable requirement for sustainable development. Sustainable development \nand the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and \nmutually reinforcing. We reaffirm that gender equality and the empowerment of all \nwomen and girls is an essential prerequisite for sustainable development. We cannot \nachieve our shared ambitions for the future without addressing these challenges with \nurgency and renewed vigour. We are committed to ensuring that the multilateral \nsystem can turbocharge our aspirations to deliver for people and planet, and we will \nplace people at the centre of all our actions. \nAction 1. We will take bold, ambitious, accelerated, just and transformative \nactions to implement the 2030 Agenda, achieve the Sustainable Development \nGoals and leave no one behind. \n20. We reaffirm that the Sustainable Development Goals are a comprehensive, far-\nreaching and people-centred set of universal transformative Goals and targets. We \nreiterate our steadfast commitment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by \n2030 and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development, working \nclosely with all relevant stakeholders. We recognize that the 2030 Agenda is universal \nand that all developing countries, including countries in special situations, in \nparticular African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing \ncountries and small island developing States, as well as those with specific \nchallenges, including middle-income countries and countries in conflict and post-\nconflict situations, require assistance to implement the Agenda. We will strengthen \nour actions to address climate change. We reaffirm the principles of the Rio \nDeclaration on Environment and Development,6 including the principle of common \nbut differentiated responsibilities as set out in principle 7 thereof. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nScale up our efforts towards the full implementation of 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda7 and the Paris Agreement; \n \n(b) \nFully implement the commitments in the political declaration agreed at the \nSustainable Development Goals Summit in 2023;8  \n \n(c) \nMobilize significant and adequate resources and investments from all \nsources for sustainable development;  \n \n(d) \nRemove all obstacles to sustainable development and refrain from \neconomic coercion. \nAction 2. We will place the eradication of poverty at the centre of our efforts to \nachieve the 2030 Agenda. \n21. Eradicating poverty, in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, \nis an imperative for all humankind. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nTake comprehensive and targeted measures to eradicate poverty by \naddressing the multidimensional nature of poverty, including through rural \ndevelopment strategies and investments and innovations in the social sector, \nespecially education and health; \n__________________ \n \n6 Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Rio de Janeiro, \n3\u2013 14 June 1992, vol. I, Resolutions Adopted by the Conference (United Nations publication, \nSales No. E.93.I.8 and corrigendum), resolution 1, annex I. \n \n7 Resolution 69/313, annex. \n \n8 Resolution 78/1, annex. \n\nThe Pact for the Future \nA/RES/79/1\n \n5/56\n24-16433 \n \n \n(b) \nTake concrete actions to prevent people from falling back into poverty, \nincluding by establishing well-designed, sustainable and efficient social protection \nsystems for all that are responsive to shocks. \nAction 3. We will end hunger and eliminate food insecurity and all forms of \nmalnutrition. \n22. We remain deeply concerned that one third of the world\u2019s population remains \nfood-insecure, and we will respond to and tackle the drivers of food insecurity and \nmalnutrition. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nSupport countries and communities affected by food insecurity and all \nforms of malnutrition through coordinated action, including through the provision of \nemergency food supplies, programmes, financing, support to agricultural production, \nby building national resilience to shocks and by ensuring that food and agriculture \nsupply chains function, and markets and trade channels remain free and accessible; \n \n(b) \nAssist countries in debt distress to manage volatility in international food \nmarkets and work in partnership with international financial institutions and the \nUnited Nations system to support developing countries affected by food insecurity;  \n \n(c) \nPromote equitable, resilient, inclusive and sustainable agrifood systems so \nthat everyone has access to safe, affordable, sufficient and nutritious food. \nAction 4. We will close the Sustainable Development Goal financing gap in \ndeveloping countries.  \n23. We are deeply concerned by the growing Sustainable Development Goal \nfinancing gap facing developing countries. We must close this gap to prevent a lasting \nsustainable development divide, widening inequality within and between countries \nand a further erosion of trust in international relations and the multilateral system. We \nnote ongoing efforts to address the financing gap, including through the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposal for a Sustainable Development Goal stimulus. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nProvide and mobilize sustainable, affordable, accessible, transparent and \npredictable development finance from all sources and the required means of \nimplementation to developing countries; \n \n(b) \nContinue to advance with urgency towards a Sustainable Development \nGoal stimulus through the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal at the United Nations and in \nother relevant forums; \n \n(c) \nScale up and fulfil our respective official development assistance \ncommitments, including the commitment by most developed countries to reach the \ngoal of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance and \n0.15 to 0.20 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance to \nleast developed countries; \n \n(d) \nContinue discussions on the modernization of measurements of official \ndevelopment assistance, while adhering to existing commitments;  \n \n(e) \nEnsure that development assistance is focused on and reaches developing \ncountries, focused in particular on the poorest and most vulnerable, and take further \nactions to strengthen its effectiveness; \n \n(f) \nCreate a more enabling environment at the global, regional and national \nlevels to increase the mobilization of domestic resources and enhance the capacities, \ninstitutions and systems of developing countries at all levels to achieve this goal, \nincluding through international support, to increase investment in sustainable \ndevelopment; \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n6/56 \n \n \n(g) \nImplement effective economic, social and environmental policies and \nensure good governance and transparent institutions to advance sustainable \ndevelopment;  \n \n(h) \nStrengthen ongoing efforts to prevent and combat illicit financial flows, \ncorruption, money-laundering and tax evasion, eliminate safe havens and recover and \nreturn assets derived from illicit activities; \n \n(i) \nPromote inclusive and effective international tax cooperation, which \ncontributes significantly to national efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development \nGoals, as it enables countries to effectively mobilize their domestic resources, and \nstress that the current international tax governance structures need improvements. We \nare committed to strengthening the inclusiveness and effectiveness of tax cooperation \nat the United Nations, while taking into consideration the work of other relevant \nforums and institutions, and will continue to engage constructively in the process \ntowards developing a United Nations framework convention on international tax \ncooperation; \n \n(j) \nExplore options for international cooperation on the taxation of high-net-\nworth individuals in the appropriate forums; \n \n(k) \nSupport developing countries to catalyse increased private sector \ninvestment in sustainable development, including by promoting inclusive and \ninnovative finance mechanisms and partnerships and by creating a more enabling \ndomestic and international regulatory and investment environment, and through the \ncatalytic use of public financing;  \n \n(l) \nScale up support from all sources for investment in increasing productive \ncapacities, inclusive and sustainable industrialization, infrastructure and structural \neconomic transformation, diversification and growth in developing countries; \n \n(m) Secure an ambitious outcome at the Fourth International Conference on \nFinancing for Development in 2025 to close the Sustainable Development Goal \nfinancing gap and accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the \nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.  \nAction 5. We will ensure that the multilateral trading system continues to be an \nengine for sustainable development. \n24. We are committed to a rules-based, non-discriminatory, open, fair, inclusive, \nequitable and transparent multilateral trading system, with the World Trade \nOrganization at its core. We underscore the importance of the multilateral trading \nsystem contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We \nreiterate that States are strongly urged to refrain from promulgating and applying \nunilateral economic measures not in accordance with international law and the \nCharter of the United Nations that impede the full achievement of economic and \nsocial development, particularly in developing countries. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nPromote export-led growth in developing countries through, inter alia, \npreferential trade access for developing countries, as appropriate, and targeted special \nand differential treatment that responds to the development needs of individual \ncountries, in particular least developed countries, in line with World Trade \nOrganization commitments; \n \n(b) \nWork towards concluding the necessary reform of the World Trade \nOrganization; \n \n(c) \nFacilitate accession to the World Trade Organization, especially for \ndeveloping countries, and promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation.  \n\nThe Pact for the Future \nA/RES/79/1\n \n7/56\n24-16433 \n \nAction 6. We will invest in people to end poverty and strengthen trust and social \ncohesion.  \n25. We express our deep concern at persistent inequalities within and between \ncountries and at the slow pace of progress towards improving the lives and livelihoods \nof people everywhere, including people in vulnerable situations. We must meet the \nSustainable Development Goals for all segments of society and leave no one behind, \nincluding through the localization of sustainable development. We emphasize that \nguaranteeing access to energy and ensuring energy security is critical for achieving \nthe Sustainable Development Goals, promoting economic development, social \nstability, national security and the welfare of all nations worldwide. We decide to:  \n \n(a) \nSecure an ambitious outcome at the World Social Summit entitled \u201cSecond \nWorld Summit for Social Development\u201d in 2025; \n \n(b) \nPromote universal health coverage, increase access to quality, inclusive \neducation and lifelong learning, including in emergencies, and improve opportunities \nfor decent work for all, universal access to social protection to eradicate poverty and \nreduce inequalities;  \n \n(c) \nEnsure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and support \ndeveloping countries to plan and implement just, safe, healthy, accessible, resilient \nand sustainable cities; \n \n(d) \nAccelerate efforts to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and \nmodern energy for all, including efforts for resilient and secure cross-border energy \ninfrastructure, and increase substantially the share of renewable energy;  \n \n(e) \nMaximize the positive contribution of migrants to the sustainable \ndevelopment of origin, transit, destination and host countries and strengthen \ninternational partnerships and global cooperation for safe, orderly and regular migration \nto comprehensively address the drivers of irregular migration and ensure the safety, \ndignity and human rights of all migrants, regardless of their migration status; \n \n(f) \nAddress and promote the prevention of water scarcity and build resilience \nto drought to achieve a world in which water is a sustainable resource and ensure the \navailability and sustainable management of clean and safe water, sanitation and \nhygiene for all; \n \n(g) \nPromote a disaster risk-informed approach to sustainable development that \nintegrates disaster risk reduction into policies, programmes and investments at all \nlevels. \nAction 7. We will strengthen our efforts to build peaceful, just and inclusive \nsocieties for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build \neffective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels and uphold human \nrights and fundamental freedoms. \n26. \nWe reaffirm the need to build peaceful just and inclusive societies that provide \nequal access to justice and that are based on respect for human rights, on rule of law \nand good governance at all levels and on transparent and effective and accountable \ninstitutions. We reaffirm that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, \ninterdependent and mutually reinforcing and that all human rights must be treated in a \nfair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nRespect, protect and fulfil all human rights and fundamental freedoms, \nincluding the right to development, promote the rule of law at the national and \ninternational levels and ensure equal justice for all and develop good governance at \nall levels and transparent, inclusive, effective and accountable institutions at all \nlevels; \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n8/56 \n \n \n(b) \nPromote and protect human rights and the implementation of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development as interrelated and mutually reinforcing, while \nrecognizing that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development contains a pledge to \nleave no one behind and envisages a world of universal respect for and promotion of \nhuman rights and human dignity, the rule of law, justice, equality and \nnon-discrimination. \nAction 8. We will achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women \nand girls as a crucial contribution to progress across all the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and targets. \n27. We recognize that the achievement of full human potential and sustainable \ndevelopment is not possible if women and girls are denied full human rights and \nopportunities. Sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable \ndevelopment can only be realized when all women, adolescent girls and girls have \ntheir full human rights respected, protected and fulfilled. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nTake bold, ambitious, accelerated, just and transformative actions to \nensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by \nall women and girls;  \n \n(b) \nUrgently remove all legal, social and economic barriers to achieve gender \nequality and ensure women\u2019s full and effective participation and equal opportunities \nfor leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life; \n \n(c) \nTake targeted and accelerated action to eradicate all forms of violence and \nharassment against all women and girls, including sexual and gender-based violence; \n \n(d) \nSignificantly increase investments to close the gender gap, including in \nthe care and support economy, acknowledging the linkage between poverty and \ngender inequality and the need to strengthen support for institutions in relation to \ngender equality and the empowerment of women;  \n \n(e) \nUndertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as \nwell as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, \nfinancial services, inheritance, natural resources and appropriate new technology, in \naccordance with national laws; \n \n(f) \nEnsure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive \nrights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International \nConference on Population and Development9 and the Beijing Platform for Action and \nthe outcome documents of their review conferences. \nAction 9. We will strengthen our actions to address climate change. \n28. We are deeply concerned at the current slow pace of progress in addressing \nclimate change. We are equally deeply concerned at the continued growth in \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and we recognize the importance of the means of \nimplementation and support for developing countries, and the increasing frequency, \nintensity and scale of the adverse impacts of climate change, in particular on \ndeveloping countries, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse \neffects of climate change. In pursuit of the objectives of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and of the Paris Agreement, we reaffirm \nthe importance of accelerating action in this critical decade on the basis of the best \navailable science, reflecting equity and the principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national \n__________________ \n \n9 Report of the International Conference on Population and Development, Cairo, 5\u201313 September \n1994 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.95.XIII.18), chap.

We decide to: \n \n(a) \nReaffirm the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in \nthe global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial \nlevels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius \nabove pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks \nand impacts of climate change, and underscore that the impacts of climate change will \nbe much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with \n2 degrees Celsius and resolve to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to \n1.5 degrees Celsius; \n \n(b) \nWelcome the decisions adopted at the twenty-eighth session of the \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, including the decisions adopted under the \u201cUAE Consensus\u201d, which includes \nthe outcome of the first global stocktake of the Paris Agreement, at the fifth session \nof the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris \nAgreement; \n \n(c) \nFurther recognize the need for deep, rapid and sustained reductions in \ngreenhouse gas emissions in line with 1.5 degrees Celsius pathways and call on \nparties to contribute to the following global efforts, in a nationally determined \nmanner, taking into account the Paris Agreement and their different national \ncircumstances, pathways and approaches: tripling renewable energy capacity globally \nand doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by \n2030; accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power; \naccelerating efforts globally towards net zero emission energy systems, utilizing zero- \nand low-carbon fuels well before or by around mid-century; transitioning away from \nfossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating \naction in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the \nscience; accelerating zero- and low-emission technologies, including, inter alia, \nrenewables, nuclear, abatement and removal technologies such as carbon capture and \nutilization and storage, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors, and low-carbon \nhydrogen production; accelerating and substantially reducing non-carbon dioxide \nemissions globally, including in particular methane emissions by 2030; accelerating \nthe reduction of emissions from road transport on a range of pathways, including \nthrough development of infrastructure and rapid deployment of zero- and low-\nemission vehicles; and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that do not address \nenergy poverty or just transitions, as soon as possible; \n \n(d) \nRecognize that transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy \ntransition, while ensuring energy security;  \n \n(e) \nFurther emphasize the importance of conserving, protecting and restoring \nnature and ecosystems towards achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goal, \nincluding through enhanced efforts towards halting and reversing deforestation and \nforest degradation by 2030, and other terrestrial and marine ecosystems acting as \nsinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and by conserving biodiversity, while \nensuring social and environmental safeguards, in line with the Kunming-Montreal \nGlobal Biodiversity Framework;10 \n \n(f) \nReaffirm our resolve to set, at the twenty-ninth session of the Conference \nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a \nnew collective quantified goal from a floor of 100 billion United States dollars per \nyear, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries;

We will accelerate our efforts to restore, protect, conserve and \nsustainably use the environment. \n29. We are deeply concerned about rapid environmental degradation, and we \nrecognize the urgent need for a fundamental shift in our approach in order to achieve \na world in which humanity lives in harmony with nature.

We will protect and promote culture and sport as integral components \nof sustainable development. \n30. \nWe recognize that culture as well as sport offer individuals and communities a \nstrong sense of identity and foster social cohesion. We also recognize that sport can \ncontribute to individuals\u2019 and communities\u2019 health and well-being. Culture as well as \nsport therefore are important enablers of sustainable development. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nEnsure that culture as well as sport can contribute to more effective, \ninclusive, equitable and sustainable development, and integrate culture into \neconomic, social and environmental development policies and strategies and ensure \nadequate public investment in the protection and promotion of culture; \n \n(b) \nEncourage strengthened international cooperation on the return or \nrestitution of cultural properties of spiritual, ancestral, historical and cultural value to \ncountries of origin, including but not limited to objets d\u2019art, monuments, museum \npieces, manuscripts and documents, and strongly encourage relevant private entities \nto similarly engage, including through bilateral dialogue and with the assistance of \nmultilateral mechanisms, as appropriate; \n \n(c) \nPromote and support intercultural and interreligious dialogue to strengthen \nsocial cohesion and contribute to sustainable development. \nAction 12.

We will protect all civilians in armed conflict. \n35. We condemn in the strongest terms the devastating impact of armed conflict on \ncivilians, civilian infrastructure and cultural heritage, and we are particularly \nconcerned about the disproportionate impact of violence on women, children, persons \nwith disabilities and other persons in vulnerable situations in armed conflict. \nGenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, including deliberate attacks \nagainst civilians and civilian infrastructure, are prohibited under international law. \nWe reaffirm our commitment to our obligations under international law, including \ninternational humanitarian law, international human rights law and international \nrefugee law. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nTake concrete and practical measures to protect all civilians in armed \nconflict; \n__________________ \n \n11 Resolution 2625 (XXV), annex. \n \n12 A/77/CRP.1/Add.8. \n\nThe Pact for the Future \nA/RES/79/1\n \n13/56\n24-16433 \n \n \n(b) \nAccelerate the implementation of our commitments under the children and \narmed conflict agenda; \n \n(c) \nRestrict or refrain from, as appropriate, the use of explosive weapons in \npopulated areas when their use may be expected to cause harm to civilians or civilian \nobjects, including essential civilian infrastructure, schools, medical facilities and \nplaces of worship, in accordance with international law; \n \n(d) \nEnable safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access and assistance, and \nfully respect the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and \nindependence, in accordance with international humanitarian law and in full respect \nof General Assembly resolution 46/182 of 19 December 1991 and its related \nresolutions on strengthening the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance \nof the United Nations; \n \n(e) \nRespect and protect humanitarian personnel and United Nations and \nassociated personnel, including national and locally recruited personnel, their \nfacilities, equipment, transports and supplies, in accordance with our obligations \nunder international law, including international humanitarian law;  \n \n(f) \nRespect and protect journalists, media professionals and associated \npersonnel working in situations of armed conflict and reaffirm that they shall be \nconsidered as civilians in such situations, in accordance with international \nhumanitarian law;  \n \n(g) \nRedouble our efforts to end impunity and ensure accountability for \nviolations of international humanitarian law, most serious crimes under international \nlaw, including genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and other atrocity \ncrimes and other gross violations, such as the use of starvation of civilians as a method \nof war and gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence; \n \n(h) \nInvite Member States to enact national legislation, regulations and \nprocedures, where they do not already exist, to exercise control over the international \ntransfer of conventional arms and military equipment that manage the risks that such \ntransfers could facilitate, contribute or lead to violations of international humanitarian \nlaw and human rights law, and to ensure that such legislation, regulations and \nprocedures are consistent with the obligations of States under applicable international \ntreaties to which they are parties. \nAction 15.

We decide to: \n \n(a) \nDeliver on our commitment in the 2030 Agenda to significantly reduce all \nforms of violence and related death rates everywhere; \n \n(b) \nRedouble our efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against all women \nand girls; \n \n(c) \nCombat racism and eliminate racial discrimination, xenophobia and \nreligious intolerance and all other forms of intolerance and discrimination from our \nsocieties and promote interreligious and intercultural dialogue;  \n \n(d) \nStrengthen and implement existing national prevention strategies and \napproaches to sustain peace, and consider developing them where they do not exist, \non a voluntary basis and in accordance with national priorities, to address the root \ncauses of violence and armed conflict; \n \n(e) \nProvide assistance to States, upon their request, including through the \nPeacebuilding Commission and the entire United Nations system, in full conformity \nwith national ownership and needs, to build national capacity to promote, develop \nand implement their nationally owned prevention efforts and address the root causes \nof violence and conflict in their countries, including through sharing best practice and \nlessons learned; \n \n(f) \nAddress the risks associated with illicit trade in small arms and light \nweapons, their parts and ammunition, or associated ammunition, including through \nnational prevention strategies and approaches;  \n \n(g) \nAddress the risks to sustaining peace posed by disinformation, \nmisinformation, hate speech and content inciting harm, including content \ndisseminated through digital platforms, while respecting the right to freedom of \nexpression and to privacy and ensuring unhindered access to the Internet in \naccordance with international law, domestic legislation and national policies; \n \n(h) \nPursue stronger alignment between the United Nations, international and \nregional financial institutions and the needs of Member States affected by armed \nconflict and violence and the impacts of regional conflict, to support their economic \nstability, national prevention and peacebuilding efforts, in line with their respective \nmandates and in full conformity with national ownership.  \nAction 19. We will accelerate the implementation of our commitments on women, \npeace and security.  \n40. We recognize the role of women as agents of peace. The full, equal, safe and \nmeaningful participation of women in decision-making at all levels of peace and \nsecurity, including conflict prevention and resolution, mediation and in peace \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n16/56 \n \noperations, is essential to achieve sustainable peace. We condemn in the strongest \nterms the increased levels of all forms of violence against women and girls, who are \nparticularly at risk of violence in armed conflict, post-conflict situations and \nhumanitarian emergencies.

United Nations peace operations, understood as peacekeeping operations and \nspecial political missions, are critical tools to maintain international peace and \nsecurity. They face increasingly complex challenges and urgently need to adapt, \ntaking into account the needs of all Member States and troop- and police-contributing \ncountries, and the priorities and responsibilities of host countries. Peace operations \ncan only succeed when political solutions are actively pursued and they have \npredictable, adequate and sustained financing. We reaffirm the importance of \nenhanced collaboration between the United Nations and regional and subregional \norganizations, in particular the African Union, including their peace support \noperations and peace enforcement authorized by the Security Council to maintain or \nrestore international peace and security. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nCall on the Security Council to ensure that peace operations are anchored \nin and guided by political strategies, deployed with clear, sequenced and prioritized \nmandates that are realistic and achievable, exit strategies and viable transition plans, \nand as part of a comprehensive approach to sustaining peace in full compliance with \ninternational law and the Charter; \n\nThe Pact for the Future \nA/RES/79/1\n \n17/56\n24-16433 \n \n \n(b) \nRequest the Secretary-General to undertake a review on the future of all \nforms of United Nations peace operations, taking into account lessons learned from \nprevious and ongoing reform processes, and provide strategic and action-oriented \nrecommendations for the consideration of Member States on how the United Nations \ntoolbox can be adapted to meet evolving needs, to allow for more agile, tailored \nresponses to existing, emerging and future challenges; \n \n(c) \nEnsure that peace operations engage at the earliest possible stage in \nplanning transitions with host countries, the United Nations country team and relevant \nnational stakeholders; \n \n(d) \nTake concrete steps to ensure the safety and security of the personnel of \npeace operations and improve their access to health facilities, including mental health \nservices; \n \n(e) \nEnsure that peacekeeping operations and peace support operations, \nincluding peace enforcement, authorized by the Security Council are accompanied by \nan inclusive political strategy and other non-military approaches and address the root \ncauses of conflict; \n \n(f) \nEncourage the Secretary-General to convene regular high-level meetings \nwith relevant regional organizations to discuss matters pertaining to peace operations, \npeacebuilding and conflicts; \n \n(g) \nEnsure adequate, predictable and sustainable financing for African Union-\nled peace support operations mandated by the Security Council in line with Security \nCouncil resolution 2719 (2023) of 21 December 2023. \nAction 22. We will address the serious impact of threats to maritime security and \nsafety.  \n43. We recognize the need to address the serious impact of threats to maritime \nsecurity and safety. All efforts to address threats to maritime security and safety must \nbe carried out in accordance with international law, including particularly as reflected \nin the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and the 1982 United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 13 taking into account other relevant \ninstruments that are consistent with the Convention.

We highlight the importance of putting measures in place to counter the \ndissemination of terrorist propaganda, preventing and suppressing the flow of \nfinancing and material means for terrorist activities, as well as recruitment activities \nof terrorist organizations. We reaffirm that terrorism and violent extremism conducive \nto terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, civilization or \nethnic group. We will redouble our efforts to address the conditions conducive to the \nspread of terrorism, prevent and combat terrorism, build States\u2019 capacity to prevent \nand combat terrorism and strengthen the role of the United Nations system.

We will advance the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. \n46. A nuclear war would visit devastation upon all humankind and we must make \nevery effort to avert the danger of such a war, bearing in mind that \u201ca nuclear war \ncannot be won and must never be fought\u201d. We will uphold our respective obligations \nand commitments. We reiterate our deep concern over the state of nuclear \ndisarmament.

We decide to: \n \n(a) \nRecommit to the goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons; \n \n(b) \nRecognize that, while the final objective of the efforts of all States should \ncontinue to be general and complete disarmament under effective international control, \nthe immediate goal is elimination of the danger of a nuclear war and implementation of \nmeasures to avoid an arms race and clear the path towards lasting peace;  \n \n(c) \nHonour and respect all existing security assurances undertaken, including \nin connection with the treaties and relevant protocols of nuclear-weapon-free zones \nand their associated assurances against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons; \n \n(d) \nCommit to strengthening the disarmament and non-proliferation \narchitecture and work to prevent any erosion of existing international norms and take \nall possible steps to prevent nuclear war; \n\nThe Pact for the Future \nA/RES/79/1\n \n19/56\n24-16433 \n \n \n(e) \nSeek to accelerate the full and effective implementation of respective \nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation obligations and commitments, including \nby adhering to relevant international legal instruments and through the pursuit of \nnuclear-weapon-free zones to enhance international peace and security and the \nachievement of a nuclear-weapon-free world. \nAction 26. We will uphold our disarmament obligations and commitments. \n47. We express our serious concern at the increasing number of actions that are \ncontrary to existing international norms and non-compliance with obligations in the \nfield of disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation. We will respect \ninternational law that applies to weapons, means and methods of warfare, and support \nprogressive efforts to effectively eradicate the illicit trade in arms. We recognize the \nimportance of maintaining and strengthening the role of the United Nations \ndisarmament machinery. Any use of chemical and biological weapons by anyone, \nanywhere and under any circumstances is unacceptable. We call for full compliance \nwith and implementation of relevant treaties. We reaffirm our shared determination \nto exclude completely the possibility of biological agents and toxins being used as \nweapons and to strengthen the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, \nProduction and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and \non Their Destruction.14 We decide to:  \n \n(a) \nRevitalize the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament, \nincluding by recommending that the General Assembly pursue work that could \nsupport preparation of a fourth special session devoted to disarmament (SSOD-IV); \n \n(b) \nPursue a world free from chemical and biological weapons and ensure that \nthose responsible for any use of these weapons are identified and held accountable; \n \n(c) \nAddress emerging and evolving biological risks through improving \nprocesses to anticipate, prevent, coordinate and prepare for such risks, whether caused \nby natural, accidental or deliberate release of biological agents; \n \n(d) \nIdentify, examine and develop effective measures, including possible \nlegally binding measures, to strengthen and institutionalize international norms and \ninstruments against the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling, \nretention and use of biological agents and toxins as weapons;  \n \n(e) \nStrengthen measures to prevent the acquisition of weapons of mass \ndestruction by non-State actors; \n \n(f) \nRedouble our efforts to implement our respective obligations under \nrelevant international instruments to prohibit or restrict conventional weapons due to \ntheir humanitarian impact and take steps to promote all relevant aspects of mine \naction; \n \n(g) \nStrengthen our national and international efforts to combat, prevent and \neradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects;  \n \n(h) \nAddress existing gaps in through-life conventional ammunition \nmanagement to reduce the dual risks of unplanned conventional ammunition \nexplosions and the diversion and illicit trafficking of conventional ammunition to \nunauthorized recipients, including to criminals, organized criminal groups and \nterrorists. \n__________________ \n \n14 Ibid., vol. 1015, No. 14860. \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n20/56 \n \nAction 27. We will seize the opportunities associated with new and emerging \ntechnologies and address the potential risks posed by their misuse. \n48.

Science, technology and innovation and digital cooperation \n \n49. \nScience, technology and innovation have the potential to accelerate the realization \nof the aspirations of the United Nations across all three pillars of its work. We will only \nrealize this potential through international cooperation to harness the benefits and take \nbold, ambitious and decisive steps to bridge the growing divide within and between \ndeveloped and developing countries and accelerate progress on the 2030 Agenda. \nBillions of people, especially in developing countries, do not have meaningful access \nto critical life-changing technologies. If we are to make good on our promise to leave \nno one behind, sharing science, technology and innovation is essential. Innovations and \nscientific breakthrough that can make our planet more sustainable and our countries \nmore prosperous and resilient should be affordable and accessible to all. \n50.

Youth and future generations \n \n58. Today\u2019s generation of children and young people is the largest in history, with \nmost of them living in developing countries. They are critical agents of positive \nchange and we welcome the important contributions of young people to peace and \nsecurity, sustainable development and human rights. However, across our world, \nmillions of children and young people are deprived of the conditions they need to \nreach their full potential and fulfil their human rights, especially those in vulnerable \nsituations. Children and young persons continue to live in extreme poverty, without \naccess to critical, basic services and respect for their fundamental rights. We \nrecognize that, together with future generations, they will live with the consequences \nof our actions and our inaction. We will invest in and promote engagement by young \npeople at national and international levels to secure a better future for all. \n59. We recognize that children and youth are distinct groups from future \ngenerations. We must ensure that decision-making and policymaking today takes \ngreater account of the needs and interests of the generations to come, and that they \nare balanced with the needs and interests of current generations. We have annexed a \nDeclaration on Future Generations to the Pact for the Future that details our \ncommitments in this regard. \nAction 34.

We will promote, protect and respect the human rights of all young \npeople and foster social inclusion and integration. \n61. We reaffirm the importance of ensuring the full enjoyment of the rights of all \nyoung persons, protecting them from violence and fostering social inclusion and \nintegration, especially of the poorest, those in vulnerable situations, including \nAfrodescendent populations, and those who face discrimination in multiple and \noverlapping ways. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nStep up our fight against all forms of racism, racial discrimination, \nxenophobia and all forms of intolerance that impact young people and hinder their \nability to fulfil their potential, and counter religious hatred that constitutes incitement \nto discrimination, hostility or violence; \n \n(b) \nIntensify international, regional and national efforts to take immediate and \neffective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and trafficking in \npersons, especially women and children, and eliminate all forms of child labour; \n \n(c) \nAddress the challenges faced by all young women and girls, including by \ncombating gender stereotypes and negative social norms and eliminating \ndiscrimination, harassment, all forms of violence against young women and girls, \nincluding sexual and gender-based violence, and harmful practices, including female \ngenital mutilation and child, early and forced marriage; \n\nThe Pact for the Future \nA/RES/79/1\n \n25/56\n24-16433 \n \n \n(d) \nEnhance inclusion and eliminate all barriers that hinder young persons with \ndisabilities from attaining and maintaining maximum autonomy, independence and full \ninclusion and participation in all aspects of life and invest in assistive technologies that \ncan promote their full, effective and meaningful participation in society; \n \n(e) \nAddress the adverse impact of climate change and other environmental \nchallenges that constitute threats to the ability of young persons to enjoy their human \nrights and a clean, healthy and sustainable environment; \n \n(f) \nStrengthen \nintergenerational \npartnerships \nand \nsolidarity \namong \ngenerations by promoting opportunities for voluntary, constructive and regular \ninteraction between young and older persons in their families, workplaces and in \nsociety at large. \nAction 36.

We commend the important contributions that young people are already making \nto the advancement of peace and security, sustainable development and human rights \nin their own countries. We can only meet the needs and aspirations of all young people \nif we systematically listen to them, work with them and provide them with meaningful \nopportunities to shape the future. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nEncourage and support the establishment of mechanisms at the national \nlevel, where they do not exist, to consult with young people and provide them with \nmeaningful opportunities to engage in national policymaking and decision-making \nprocesses supported, upon request, by the United Nations system, in line with national \nlegislation and policies; \n \n(b) \nConsider fostering intergenerational dialogues to build stronger \npartnerships between individuals of different age groups, including youth, and \nbetween Governments and youth; \n \n(c) \nAddress the challenges and remove barriers that prevent full, meaningful \nand effective participation of all youth, including for young women, young persons \nwith disabilities and young persons of African descent and those in vulnerable \nsituations, in national policymaking and decision-making, and improve their \nrepresentation in formal political structures; \n \n(d) \nSupport youth-led and youth-focused organizations, in particular through \ncapacity-building. \nAction 37.

Today, our multilateral system, constructed in the aftermath of the Second World \nWar, is under unprecedented strain. It has had remarkable achievements in the past 80 \nyears. But we are not complacent about the future of our international order, and we \nknow that it cannot stand still. We will take action to strengthen and reinvigorate \nmultilateralism and deepen international cooperation. We reaffirm unwavering \ncommitment to international law, including the Charter, to address global challenges, \nsome of which could overwhelm and threaten all of humanity. A transformation in \nglobal governance is essential to ensure that the positive progress we have seen across \nall three pillars of the work of the United Nations in recent decades does not unravel. \nWe will not allow this to happen. \n65. We must renew trust in global institutions by making them more representative \nof and responsive to today\u2019s world and more effective at delivering on the \ncommitments that we have made to one another and our people.

Human rights are mutually reinforcing and must be \ntreated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis. \nThe Sustainable Development Goals seek to realize the human rights of all. \nIndividuals and civil society institutions, including non-governmental organizations, \ngroups and national human rights institutions, where they exist, engaged in the \npromotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in \naccordance with national legislation consistent with the Charter of the United Nations \nand international human rights law, must be protected from any form of intimidation \nand reprisals, both online and offline. We must continue to uphold human rights in \n__________________ \n \n16 A/CONF.157/24 (Part I), chap. III. \n\nThe Pact for the Future \nA/RES/79/1\n \n31/56\n24-16433 \n \nthe future by strengthening our capabilities to respond to existing, new and emerging \nchallenges to the enjoyment of human rights. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nRecall the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \nRights, as outlined in resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, and request the \nSecretary-General to assess the need for adequate, predictable, increased and \nsustainable financing of the United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the \nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, for efficient and \neffective mandate delivery to enable them to respond to the range of human rights \nchallenges facing the international community with impartiality, objectivity and non-\nselectivity; \n \n(b) \nEnhance coordination and cooperation among United Nations entities \nworking on human rights and avoid duplication of activities, within their existing \nmandates, including through closer coordination with the Office of the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. \nAction 47. We will accelerate reform of the international financial architecture \nto address the challenges of today and tomorrow. \n75. Reform of the international financial architecture is an important step towards \nbuilding greater trust in the multilateral system. We commend ongoing reform efforts \nand call for even more urgent and ambitious action to ensure that the international \nfinancial architecture becomes more efficient, more equitable, fit for the world of \ntoday and responsive to the challenges faced by developing countries in closing the \nSustainable Development Goal financing gap. The reform of the international \nfinancial architecture should place the 2030 Agenda at its centre, with an unwavering \ncommitment to investing in the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions. \nWe decide to: \n \n(a) \nContinue to pursue deeper reforms of the international financial \narchitecture to turbocharge implementation of the 2030 Agenda and achieve a more \ninclusive, just, peaceful, resilient and sustainable world for people and planet, for \npresent and future generations. \nAction 48. We will accelerate reform of the international financial architecture \nto strengthen the voice and representation of developing countries. \n76. We acknowledge the important role of the United Nations in global economic \ngovernance, recognizing that the United Nations and the international financial \ninstitutions have complementary mandates that make the coordination of their actions \ncrucial, while fully respecting existing governance mechanisms and mandates \nindependent of the United Nations that preside over specific organizations and rules. \nWe note with appreciation the initiative to convene a biennial summit at the level of \nHeads of State and Government to strengthen existing and establish more systematic \nlinks and coordination between the United Nations and the international financial \ninstitutions and we stress the importance of inclusive participation. We recognize the \nimportance of continuing to pursue governance reforms at the international financial \ninstitutions and multilateral development banks. We underscore the need to enhance \nthe representation and voice of developing countries in global economic decision-\nmaking, norm-setting and global economic governance at international economic and \nfinancial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, \nto deliver more effective, credible, accountable and legitimate institutions. We \nwelcome steps to improve the voice and representation of developing countries, and \nthe creation of a twenty-fifth chair on the International Monetary Fund Executive \nBoard for sub-Saharan Africa and recent changes to quotas and voting power. We \nunderscore the importance of improving diversity and gender representation in the \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n32/56 \n \nexecutive boards, senior management and staff positions. These steps can equip these \ninstitutions to better address global challenges. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nEncourage the Board of the International Monetary Fund to take further \nsteps to continue to support a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced institution \nand improve the voice and representation of developing countries, in particular \nthrough the ongoing work of the Executive Board of the Fund to develop by June \n2025 possible approaches as a guide for further quota realignment, including through \na new quota formula, under the seventeenth general review of quotas, while protecting \nthe quota shares of the poorest members;  \n \n(b) \nUrge the governing bodies of the World Bank and other multilateral \ndevelopment banks to take further steps to achieve robust and broader representation, \nvoice and participation of developing countries, while fully recognizing ongoing \nefforts in this regard. \nAction 49. We will accelerate reform of the international financial architecture \nto mobilize additional financing for the Sustainable Development Goals, respond \nto the needs of developing countries and direct financing to those most in need. \n77. \nDeveloping countries require enhanced access to financing from all sources to \nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Flows of capital to many developing \ncountries are falling, and more capital is leaving many developing countries than is \ncoming in. Multilateral development banks play a vital role in supporting sustainable \ndevelopment and the achievement of the Goals and are critical to increasing countries\u2019 \naccess to finance on more affordable terms and helping to unlock private sector \ninvestment. We welcome ongoing reform efforts of the multilateral development banks \nto mobilize greater financing for the 2030 Agenda, recognizing that further reforms of \nthe banks are urgently needed, in addition to the strengthening of domestic resource \nmobilization and domestic policy and regulatory environments. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nDeliver a robust and impactful twenty-first replenishment of the \nInternational Development Association that includes contributions and strong policy \ncommitments from both new and existing donors that significantly increase the \nresources of the Association, and work towards establishing a pathway to \nsignificantly and sustainably increase the Association by the 2030 replenishment; \n \n(b) \nUrge multilateral development banks to accelerate the pace of reforms to \ntheir missions and visions, incentive structures, operational approaches and financial \ncapacity, and to consider additional steps to increase the availability of finance, \nprovide policy support and technical assistance to developing countries to address \nglobal challenges and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; \n \n(c) \nUrge multilateral development banks\u2019 governing boards and management \nto enable additional finance from the banks\u2019 own balance sheets by fully \nimplementing, where relevant and appropriate, the recommendations from the Group \nof 20 independent review of multilateral development banks\u2019 capital adequacy \nframeworks, including reflecting the value of callable capital in multilateral \ndevelopment bank capital adequacy frameworks and issuing hybrid capital at scale, \nwhile ensuring financial sustainability of respective multilateral development banks; \n \n(d) \nEncourage the boards of multilateral development banks to consider \nscheduling further general capital increases, while recognizing recent capital \ncontributions, if needed; \n \n(e) \nInvite the multilateral development banks, in consultation with the \nSecretary-General, to present options and recommendations on new approaches to \nimprove access to concessional finance for developing countries, with full respect for \nthe independent mandate and authorities of the respective governing body of each \n\nThe Pact for the Future \nA/RES/79/1\n \n33/56\n24-16433 \n \nmultilateral development bank and request the Secretary-General to update Member \nStates on progress; \n \n(f) \nNote the work of the international financial institutions, international \norganizations and multilateral development banks to consider structural vulnerability \nand invite them to consider using the multidimensional vulnerability index, as \nappropriate, as a complement to their existing practices and policies in line with their \nrespective mandates;  \n \n(g) \nCall on multilateral development banks to provide timely support to \ndeveloping countries by increasing and optimizing long-term concessional finance, \nincluding lending in local currencies, as well as the design, financing and scaling up \nof country-owned and -driven innovative mechanisms.  \nAction 50. We will accelerate the reform of the international financial \narchitecture so that countries can borrow sustainably to invest in their long-term \ndevelopment. \n78. Borrowing is vital for countries to invest in their long-term development. \nCountries must be able to borrow sustainably, and have access to credit on affordable \nterms, while ensuring full transparency. We are deeply concerned by the emergence \nof unsustainable debt burdens and vulnerabilities in many developing countries, and \nthe constraint this imposes on their development progress. We recognize the \nimportance of strengthening the safeguards to prevent these situations from occurring. \nWe underline the importance of reforms to existing multilateral processes to facilitate \ncollective action to prevent debt crises, and facilitate debt restructuring and debt \nrelief, when appropriate, taking into account evolving trends in the global debt \nlandscape. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nStrengthen the multilateral response to support countries with high and \nunsustainable debt burdens, with the meaningful participation of the countries \nconcerned and all relevant actors, ensuring an approach that is more effective, orderly, \npredictable, coordinated, transparent and timely to enable those countries to escape \ndebt overhang and prioritize government expenditure on the achievement of the \nSustainable Development Goals; \n \n(b) \nInvite the International Monetary Fund to undertake a review of ways to \nstrengthen and improve the sovereign debt architecture, building on existing \ninternational processes, in collaboration with the Secretary-General, the World Bank, \nthe Group of 20 and major bilateral creditors, and debtors, and request that the \nSecretary-General update Member States on progress and present proposals on this \nissue;  \n \n(c) \nTake note of the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to engage with credit rating \nagencies on their role in sustainable development and request the Secretary-General \nkeep Member States updated on these discussions; \n \n(d) \nImprove and continue to implement the Group of 20 Common Framework \nfor Debt Treatments to enable effective, predictable, coordinated, timely and orderly \nrestructuring processes and encourage steps to ensure comparability of treatment of \nsovereign and private creditors;  \n \n(e) \nPromote, where appropriate, the use of state-contingent clauses in lending, \nincluding climate-resilient debt clauses when lending to developing countries \nvulnerable to hazards, including the adverse impact of climate change; \n \n(f) \nPromote greater use of debt swaps for the Sustainable Development Goals, \nincluding debt swaps for climate or nature, to developing countries, as appropriate. \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n34/56 \n \nAction 51. We will accelerate the reform of the international financial \narchitecture to strengthen its capacity to support developing countries more \neffectively and equitably during systemic shocks and make the financial system \nmore stable. \n79. The growing frequency and intensity of global economic shocks has set back \nprogress on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We recognize \nthe role of special drawing rights in strengthening the global financial safety net in a \nworld prone to systemic shocks, and their potential contribution to greater global \nfinancial stability. We welcome the pledges to rechannel over 100 billion dollars \nworth of special drawing rights, or equivalent contributions, to developing countries \nwhile stressing the urgency of delivering on these pledges to developing countries as \nrapidly as possible. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nCall on countries that are in a position to do so to voluntarily rechannel \nspecial drawing rights from the 2021 allocation, and for those countries to also \nconsider rechannelling at least half of their special drawing rights, including through \nmultilateral development banks, while respecting relevant legal frameworks and \npreserving the reserve asset character of special drawing rights; \n \n(b) \nEncourage the International Monetary Fund to explore all options to \ncontinue to strengthen the global financial safety net to support developing countries \nto better respond to macroeconomic shocks and consider the feasibility of expediting \nissuances of special drawing rights and facilitating prompt, voluntary rechannelling \nto developing countries during future financial crises and systemic shocks;  \n \n(c) \nWelcome the ongoing review by the International Monetary Fund of its \nsurcharge policy; \n \n(d) \nPromote financial stability through international cooperation on, and \nconsistent regulation of, banks and other financial service entities. \nAction 52. We will accelerate the reform of the international financial \narchitecture so that it can meet the urgent challenge of climate change. \n80. Climate change and biodiversity loss exacerbate many of the challenges facing \nthe international financial architecture and can undermine progress towards the \nSustainable Development Goals. Developing countries should have access to finance \nto be able to pursue their interrelated objectives of achieving sustainable \ndevelopment, including poverty eradication and promoting sustainable, inclusive, \nresilient economic growth, and addressing climate change. Investment in sustainable \ndevelopment and climate action is essential. The international financial architecture \nshould continue to channel and increase additional financing towards both sustainable \ndevelopment and climate action. Developing countries face increasing financing \nneeds, especially those particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate \nchange, leading to a growing demand for finance. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nCall on multilateral development banks and other development finance \ninstitutions to increase the availability, accessibility and impact of climate finance to \ndeveloping countries, while safeguarding the additionality of climate finance, to \nsupport developing countries to implement their national plans and strategies to \naddress climate change;  \n \n(b) \nCall on multilateral development banks to mobilize additional financing \nto support adaptation and deploy and develop renewable, low- and zero-emission and \nenergy-efficiency technologies in line with existing commitments; \n \n(c) \nCall on international financial institutions and other relevant entities to \nimprove the assessment and management of risks, including climate-related financial \n\nThe Pact for the Future \nA/RES/79/1\n \n35/56\n24-16433 \n \nrisks, support steps to address the high cost of capital for developing countries and \nprovide policy support to help to better manage and reduce risks;  \n \n(d) \nEncourage the private sector, especially large corporations, to contribute \nto sustainability and protecting our planet and the achievement of the 2030 Agenda \nand the Sustainable Development Goals, including through partnership-based \napproaches, to scale up support to developing countries and enable climate action. \nAction 53. We will develop a framework on measures of progress on sustainable \ndevelopment to complement and go beyond gross domestic product. \n81. We recognize that sustainable development must be pursued in a balanced and \nintegrated manner. We reaffirm the need to urgently develop measures of progress on \nsustainable development that complement or go beyond gross domestic product. \nThese measures should reflect progress on the economic, social and environmental \ndimensions of sustainable development, including in the consideration of informing \naccess to development finance and technical cooperation. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nRequest the Secretary-General to establish an independent high-level \nexpert group to develop recommendations for a limited number of country-owned and \nuniversally applicable indicators of sustainable development that complement and go \nbeyond gross domestic product, in close consultation with Member States and \nrelevant stakeholders, taking into account the work of the Statistical Commission, \nbuilding on the global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals \nand targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to present the \noutcome of its work during the eightieth session of the General Assembly; \n \n(b) \nInitiate a United Nations-led intergovernmental process following the \ncompletion of the work of the independent high-level expert group in consultation \nwith relevant stakeholders, including the Statistical Commission, international \nfinancial institutions, multilateral development banks and regional commissions, in \nline with their respective mandates, on measures of progress on sustainable \ndevelopment that complement or go beyond gross domestic product, considering the \nrecommendations of the Secretary-General\u2019s high-level expert group. \nAction 54. We will strengthen the international response to complex global shocks. \n82. We recognize the need for a more coherent, cooperative, coordinated and \nmultidimensional international response to complex global shocks and the central role \nof the United Nations in this regard. Complex global shocks are events that have \nseverely disruptive and adverse consequences for a significant proportion of countries \nand the global population, and that lead to impacts across multiple sectors, requiring \na multidimensional and whole-of-government, whole-of-society response. Complex \nglobal shocks have a disproportionate impact on the poorest and most vulnerable \npeople in the world and usually have disastrous consequences for sustainable \ndevelopment and prosperity. An armed conflict does not by itself constitute a complex \nglobal shock, but conflict could, in some cases, lead to impacts across multiple \nsectors. The principles of national ownership and consent, equity, solidarity and \ncooperation will guide our future responses to complex global shocks, with full \nrespect for international law, including the Charter and its purposes and principles, \nand existing mandates for United Nations intergovernmental bodies and processes, \nUnited Nations system entities and specialized agencies. We will uphold the \nSecretary-General\u2019s role to, inter alia, convene Member States, promote the \ncoordination of the whole multilateral system and engage with relevant stakeholders \nin response to crises. We request the Secretary-General to: \n \n(a) \nConsider approaches to strengthen the United Nations system response to \ncomplex global shocks, within existing authorities and in consultation with Member \nStates, that supports, complements and does not duplicate the response of the United \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n36/56 \n \nNations principal organs, relevant United Nations entities, United Nations \ncoordination entities and mechanisms, and specialized agencies mandated to respond \nto emergencies, and with full respect for the mandated coordination role of the United \nNations in response to humanitarian emergencies. \nAction 55. We will strengthen our partnerships to deliver on existing \ncommitments and address new and emerging challenges. \n83. We recognize the importance of the United Nations engagement with national \nparliaments and relevant stakeholders, while preserving the intergovernmental \ncharacter of the Organization. The challenges we face require cooperation not only \nacross borders but also across the whole of society. Our efforts must involve \nGovernments as well as parliaments, the United Nations system and other \ninternational institutions, local authorities, Indigenous Peoples, civil society, business \nand the private sector, faith-based organizations, the scientific and academic \ncommunities, and all people to ensure an effective response to our common \nchallenges. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nEnsure that relevant stakeholders can meaningfully participate, in their \nrespective roles and responsibilities, in accordance with relevant rules of procedure, \nin relevant United Nations processes and that Member States have access to the views \nand expertise of those partners; \n \n(b) \nLeverage existing channels and strengthen communication between \nUnited Nations intergovernmental bodies and civil society, allowing for ongoing \ndialogue and exchange of information;  \n \n(c) \nEncourage the contribution of the private sector to addressing global \nchallenges and strengthen its accountability towards the implementation of United \nNations frameworks; \n \n(d) \nDeepen United Nations engagement with national parliaments in United \nNations intergovernmental bodies and processes, in accordance with national \nlegislation, including through building on the efforts of the United Nations and the \nInter-Parliamentary Union to engage parliamentarians to maintain support for the \nimplementation of relevant United Nations agreements and resolutions;  \n \n(e) \nRequest the Secretary-General to provide recommendations on how \nengagement with local and regional authorities could advance the 2030 Agenda, \nparticularly the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals, by the end of the \nseventy-ninth session for Member States\u2019 consideration;  \n \n(f) \nEnhance cooperation between the United Nations and regional, \nsubregional and other organizations, within their respective mandates, which will be \ncritical to maintaining international peace and security, promoting and protecting \nhuman rights and achieving sustainable development. \nAction 56. We will strengthen international cooperation for the exploration and \nuse of outer space for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of all humanity. \n84. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 identifies the exploration and use of outer space \nas the province of all humankind. Humanity\u2019s reliance on space is increasing day by \nday and the Outer Space Treaty must be recognized as the cornerstone of the \ninternational legal regime governing outer space activities. We are living through an \nage of increased access to and activities in outer space. The growth in the number of \nobjects in outer space, the return of humans to deep space, and our expanding reliance \non outer space systems demand urgent action. The safe and sustainable use of space \nplays a critical role in the achievement of the 2030 Agenda. The opportunities for \npeople and planet are enormous, but there are also risks that must be managed. We \nencourage the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to further consult on \n\nThe Pact for the Future \nA/RES/79/1\n \n37/56\n24-16433 \n \nthe proposal to hold a fourth United Nations Conference on the Peaceful Exploration \nof Outer Space (UNISPACE IV) in 2027. We decide to: \n \n(a) \nReaffirm the importance of the widest possible adherence to and full \ncompliance with the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and discuss the establishment of new \nframeworks for space traffic, space debris and space resources through the Committee \non the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space; \n \n(b) \nInvite the engagement of relevant private sector, civil society and other \nrelevant stakeholders, where appropriate and applicable, to contribute to \nintergovernmental processes related to the increased safety and sustainability of outer \nspace. \n \n3rd plenary meeting \n22 September 2024 \n \n \n \nAnnex I \n \n \nGlobal Digital Compact \n \n1. \nDigital technologies are dramatically transforming our world. They offer \nimmense potential benefits for the well-being and advancement of people and \nsocieties and for our planet. They hold out the promise of accelerating the \nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.  \n2. \nWe can only achieve this through strengthened international cooperation that \ncloses all digital divides between and within countries. We recognize the challenges \nthat these divides pose for many countries, in particular developing countries, which \nhave pressing development needs and limited resources. \n3. \nWe recognize that the pace and power of emerging technologies are creating \nnew possibilities but also new risks for humanity, some of which are not yet fully \nknown. We recognize the need to identify and mitigate risks and to ensure human \noversight of technology in ways that advance sustainable development and the full \nenjoyment of human rights.  \n4. \nOur goal is an inclusive, open, sustainable, fair, safe and secure digital future \nfor all. This Global Digital Compact sets out the objectives, principles, commitments \nand actions we undertake to achieve it in the non-military domain. \n5. \nWe have strong foundations on which to build. Our digital cooperation rests on \ninternational law, including the Charter of the United Nations, international human \nrights law and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 17 We remain committed \nto the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society reflected in the \nGeneva Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action 18 and the Tunis Agenda for the \nInformation Society.19 The United Nations provides a critical platform for the global \ndigital cooperation we need, and we will harness existing processes to do so. \n6. \nOur cooperation must be agile and adaptable to the rapidly changing digital \nlandscape. As Governments, we will work in collaboration and partnership with the \nprivate sector, civil society, international organizations, the technical and academic \ncommunities and all other stakeholders, within their respective roles and \nresponsibilities, to realize the digital future we seek. \n \n__________________ \n \n17 Resolution 70/1. \n \n18 See A/C.2/59/3, annex. \n \n19 See A/60/687. \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n38/56 \n \nObjectives \n \n7. \nTo achieve our goal, we will pursue the following objectives:  \n \n1. \nClose all digital divides and accelerate progress across the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals;  \n \n2. \nExpand inclusion in and benefits from the digital economy for all;  \n \n3. \nFoster an inclusive, open, safe and secure digital space that respects, \nprotects and promote human rights;  \n \n4. \nAdvance responsible, equitable and interoperable data governance \napproaches; \n \n5. \nEnhance international governance of artificial intelligence for the benefit \nof humanity. \n \nPrinciples \n \n8. \nOur digital cooperation will be guided by the purposes and principles of the \nCharter of the United Nations and the following cross-cutting and mutually \nreinforcing principles: \n \n(a) \nThe inclusive participation of all States and other stakeholders is the \ncornerstone of this Compact.

Our cooperation will \nfoster innovation and the potential for societies and businesses, regardless of size or \norigin, to reap the benefits of digitalization and thrive in the digital economy; \n \n(k) \nGovernments, the private sector, civil society, the technical community, \nacademia and international and regional organizations, in their respective roles and \nresponsibilities, are essential to advance an inclusive, open, safe and secure digital \nfuture. Our cooperation will be multi-stakeholder and harness the contributions of all; \n \n(l) \nWe will enhance partnerships to ensure the provision of the required means \nof implementation to developing countries, including the mobilization of financial \nresources, capacity-building and the transfer of technology on mutually agreed terms; \n \n(m) The digital world is evolving at pace. Our cooperation must be forward-\nlooking and capable of identifying, anticipating, assessing, monitoring and adapting \nto emerging technologies so that we can seize opportunities and respond to new and \nemerging risks and challenges. \n \nCommitments and actions \n \n9. \nWe commit to pursue meaningful and measurable actions to achieve our \nobjectives. \n \nObjective 1. Close all digital divides and accelerate progress across the \nSustainable Development Goals \n \nConnectivity  \n \n10. We acknowledge the pivotal role of universal and meaningful connectivity and \naffordable access in unlocking the full potential of digital and emerging technologies. \nWe commit to connect all persons to the Internet. We recognize that this will require \nstrong partnerships and increased financial investments in developing countries from \nGovernments and other stakeholders, in particular the private sector. We affirm the \nimportant role of the International Telecommunication Union in advancing universal \nand meaningful connectivity and invite it to further continue its efforts. We recognize \nthat innovative solutions can help deliver high-speed connectivity to, inter alia, \nunderserved, remote and rural areas.  \n11. \nWe commit, by 2030, to: \n \n(a) \nDevelop and strengthen targets, indicators and metrics for universal \nmeaningful and affordable connectivity, building on existing work, and integrate \nthese into international, regional and national development strategies (SDG 9);  \n \n(b) \nDevelop innovative and blended financing mechanisms and incentives, \nincluding in collaboration with Governments, multilateral development banks, \nrelevant international organizations and the private sector, to connect the remaining \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n40/56 \n \n2.6 billion people to the Internet and to improve the quality and affordability of \nconnectivity. We will aim for entry-level broadband subscription costs that are \naccessible to the widest section of the population (SDGs 1 and 9);  \n \n(c) \nInvest in and deploy resilient digital infrastructure, including satellites and \nlocal network initiatives, that provide safe and secure network coverage to all areas, \nincluding rural, remote and \u201chard-to-reach\u201d areas, and promote equitable access to \nsatellite orbits, taking into account the needs of developing countries. We will aim for \nuniversal access at affordable rates and at sufficient speeds as well as reliability to \nenable meaningful use of the Internet (SDGs 9 and 11); \n \n(d) \nMap and connect all schools and hospitals to the Internet, building on the \nGiga initiative of the International Telecommunication Union and the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund, and enhance telemedicine services and capabilities (SDGs 3 and 4); \n \n(e) \nPromote sustainability across the life cycle of digital technologies, \nincluding context-specific measures to increase resource efficiency and to conserve \nand sustainably use natural resources and that aim to ensure that digital infrastructure \nand equipment are sustainably designed to address environmental challenges in the \ncontext of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty (SDGs 1, 4, 6, 7, \n8, 11, 12, 13 and 14);  \n \n(f) \nInclude the needs of people in vulnerable situations and those in \nunderserved, rural and remote areas in the development and implementation of \nnational and local digital connectivity strategies (SDGs 10 and 11); \n \n(g) \nMainstream a gender perspective in digital connectivity strategies to \naddress structural and systematic barriers to meaningful, safe and affordable digital \nconnectivity for all women and girls (SDG 5). \n \nDigital literacy, skills and capacities \n \n12. To fully harness the benefits of digital connectivity, we must ensure that people \ncan meaningfully and securely use the Internet and safely navigate the digital space. \nWe recognize the importance of digital skills and lifelong access to digital learning \nopportunities, taking into account the specific social, cultural and linguistic needs of \neach society and persons of all ages and backgrounds.

We further urgently: \n \n(a) \nCall on digital technology companies and developers to engage with users \nof all backgrounds and abilities to incorporate their perspectives and needs into the \nlife cycle of digital technologies (SDGs 5 and 10); \n \n(b) \nCall on digital technology companies and developers to co-develop \nindustry accountability frameworks, in consultation with Governments and other \nstakeholders, that increase transparency around their systems and processes, define \nresponsibilities and commit to standards as well as auditable public reports (SDGs 9 \nand 17);  \n \n(c) \nCall on digital technology companies and social media platforms to \nprovide online safety-related training materials and safeguards to their users, and in \nparticular, related to children and youth users (SDG 3); \n \n(d) \nCall on social media platforms to establish safe, secure and accessible \nreporting mechanisms for users and their advocates to report potential policy \nviolations, including special reporting mechanisms adapted to children and persons \nwith disabilities (SDG 3). \n \nInformation integrity  \n \n33. Access to relevant, reliable and accurate information and knowledge is essential \nfor an inclusive, open, safe and secure digital space. We recognize that digital and \nemerging technologies can facilitate the manipulation of and interference with \ninformation in ways that are harmful to societies and individuals, and negatively \naffect the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as the \nattainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. \n34. We will work together to promote information integrity, tolerance and respect \nin the digital space, as well as to protect the integrity of democratic processes. We \nwill strengthen international cooperation to address the challenge of misinformation \nand disinformation and hate speech online and mitigate the risks of information \nmanipulation in a manner consistent with international law. \n35. We commit, by 2030 to: \n \n(a) \nDesign and roll out digital media and information literacy curricula to \nensure that all users have the skills and knowledge to safely and critically interact \nwith content and with information providers and to enhance resilience against the \nharmful impacts of misinformation and disinformation (SDGs 3 and 4); \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n46/56 \n \n \n(b) \nPromote diverse and resilient information ecosystems, including by \nstrengthening independent and public media and supporting journalists and media \nworkers (SDGs 9 and 16); \n \n(c) \nProvide, promote and facilitate access to and dissemination of \nindependent, fact-based, timely, targeted, clear, accessible, multilingual and science-\nbased information to counter misinformation and disinformation (SDGs 3, 4, 9 and \n16); \n \n(d) \nPromote access to relevant, reliable and accurate information in crisis \nsituations, to protect and empower those in vulnerable situations (SDG 10); \n \n(e) \nEncourage United Nations entities, in collaboration with Governments and \nrelevant stakeholders, to assess the impact of misinformation and disinformation on \nthe achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 17).  \n36. We further urgently: \n \n(a) \nCall on digital technology companies and social media platforms to \nenhance the transparency and accountability of their systems, including terms of \nservice, content moderation and recommendation algorithms and handling of users\u2019 \npersonal data in local languages, to empower users to make informed choices and \nprovide or withdraw informed consent (SDGs 9 and 10);  \n \n(b) \nCall on social media platforms to provide researchers access to data, with \nsafeguards for user privacy, to ensure transparency and accountability to build an \nevidence base on how to address misinformation and disinformation and hate speech \nthat can inform government and industry policies, standards and best practices (SDGs \n9, 16 and 17); \n \n(c) \nCall on digital technology companies and developers to continue to \ndevelop solutions and publicly communicate actions to counter potential harms, \nincluding hate speech and discrimination, from artificial intelligence-enabled content. \nSuch measures include incorporation of safeguards into artificial intelligence model \ntraining processes, identification of artificial intelligence-generated material, \nauthenticity certification for content and origins, labelling, watermarking and other \ntechniques (SDGs 10, 16 and 17). \n \nObjective 4. Advance responsible, equitable and interoperable data \ngovernance approaches \n \nData privacy and security \n \n37. We recognize that responsible and interoperable data governance is essential to \nadvance development objectives, protect human rights, foster innovation and promote \neconomic growth. The increasing collection, sharing and processing of data, including \nin artificial intelligence systems, may amplify risks in the absence of effective \npersonal data protection and privacy norms. \n38. We recognize the urgent need for strengthened data governance cooperation at \nall levels with the effective, equitable and meaningful participation of all countries \nand in consultation with relevant stakeholders to unlock the full potential of digital \nand emerging technologies. We recognize that this will require capacity-building for \ndeveloping countries and the development and implementation of data governance \nframeworks at all levels that maximize the benefits of data use while protecting \nprivacy and securing data. We call on the United Nations system to play a role in \npromoting capacity-building for responsible and interoperable data governance.  \n\nThe Pact for the Future \nA/RES/79/1\n \n47/56\n24-16433 \n \n39. We commit, by 2030, to: \n \n(a) \nDraw on existing international and regional guidelines on the protection \nof privacy in the development of data governance frameworks (all SDGs); \n \n(b) \nStrengthen support to all countries to develop effective and interoperable \nnational data governance frameworks (all SDGs); \n \n(c) \nEmpower individuals and groups with the ability to consider, give and \nwithdraw their consent to the use of their data and the ability to choose how those \ndata are used, including through legally mandated protections for data privacy and \nintellectual property (SDGs 10 and 16); \n \n(d) \nEnsure that data collection, access, sharing, transfer, storage and \nprocessing practices are safe, secure and proportionate for necessary, explicit and \nlegitimate purposes, in compliance with international law (all SDGs); \n \n(e) \nDevelop skilled workforces capable of collecting, processing, analysing, \nstoring and transferring data safely in ways that protect privacy (SDGs 8 and 9). \n \nData exchanges and standards \n \n40. We acknowledge that data divides, including gender and geographical data gaps, \ncan lead to inequitable distribution of benefits, the misuse and misinterpretation of \ndata and biased results. \n41. We recognize that common data standards and interoperable data exchanges can \nincrease the accessibility and sharing of data and help close data divides. We will \nenable open data initiatives that are created and managed by all stakeholders, \nincluding communities and individuals, to utilize and leverage data for their \ndevelopment and well-being.  \n42. We commit, by 2030, to: \n \n(a) \nDevelop data and metadata standards designed to prevent and address bias, \ndiscrimination or human rights violations and abuses throughout the data life cycle, \nincluding through regular data auditing (SDGs 3, 5, 10 and 16); \n \n(b) \nDevelop \nbasic \ndefinitions \nand \ndata \nclassifications \nto \npromote \ninteroperability and facilitate data exchanges (all SDGs); \n \n(c) \nDevelop common definitions and standards on the use and reuse of data \nfor public benefit (all SDGs). \n \nData for the Sustainable Development Goals and for development  \n \n43. We consider that safe and secure data systems and capacity are critical for \nevidence-based policymaking and the delivery of public services. Underinvestment \nin public data systems and statistical activities can hamper progress in achieving \nsustainable development.  \n44. We recognize that quality data is critical for tracking, targeting and accelerating \nprogress across the Sustainable Development Goals as well as responding effectively \nto crises. We commit to strengthen international cooperation to close the current \nserious gaps on data for development and to increase its public availability. We will \nchampion the responsible use and sharing of data within and between countries to \nadvance progress across the Sustainable Development Goals.  \n45. We commit, by 2030, to: \n \n(a) \nIncrease financing for data and statistics from all sources and enhance \nefforts to build capacity in data and related skills, as well as responsible data use, \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n48/56 \n \nparticularly in developing countries. We will scale up predictable financing for \nsustainable development data (SDG 17); \n \n(b) \nStrengthen efforts to collect, analyse and disseminate relevant, accurate, \nreliable and disaggregated data for better monitoring and policymaking to accelerate \nthe achievement of the 2030 Agenda, while respecting privacy and data protection. \nWe will aim for a 50 per cent increase in the data available to monitor the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, disaggregated by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migration \nstatus, disability and geographical location and other characteristics relevant in \nnational contexts (all SDGs); \n \n(c) \nDevelop open and accessible data systems to support effective disaster \nearly warning, early action and crisis response (SDGs 3 and 11). \n \nCross-border data flows  \n \n46. Cross-border data flows are a critical driver of the digital economy. We \nrecognize the potential social, economic and development benefits of secure and \ntrusted cross-border data flows, in particular for micro-, small and medium-sized \nenterprises. We will identify innovative, interoperable and inclusive mechanisms to \nenable data to flow with trust within and between countries to mutual benefit, while \nrespecting relevant data protection and privacy safeguards and applicable legal \nframeworks (SDG 17). \n47. We commit, by 2030, to advance consultations among all relevant stakeholders \nto better understand commonalities, complementarities, convergence and divergence \nbetween regulatory approaches on how to facilitate cross-border data flows with trust \nso as to develop publicly available knowledge and best practices (SDG 17). \n \nInteroperable data governance \n \n48. We will promote and support interoperability between national, regional and \ninternational data policy frameworks. In this context, we request the Commission on \nScience and Technology for Development to establish a dedicated working group to \nengage in a comprehensive and inclusive multi-stakeholder dialogue on data \ngovernance at all levels as relevant for development. We encourage the working group \nto report on its progress to the General Assembly, by no later than the eighty-first \nsession, including on follow-up recommendations towards equitable and \ninteroperable data governance arrangements, which may include fundamental \nprinciples of data governance at all levels as relevant for development; proposals to \nsupport interoperability between national, regional and international data systems; \nconsiderations of sharing the benefits of data; and options to facilitate safe, secure \nand trusted data flows, including cross-border data flows as relevant for development \n(all SDGs). \n49. We will continue discussions in the United Nations, building on those outcomes \nand recognizing the ongoing work of other relevant bodies and stakeholders, \nincluding the United Nations Statistical Commission, in our efforts to pursue common \nunderstandings for data governance at all levels, as relevant for development (all \nSDGs). \n \nObjective 5. Enhance international governance of artificial intelligence for the \nbenefit of humanity \n \n50. We recognize the need for a balanced, inclusive and risk-based approach to the \ngovernance of artificial intelligence (AI), with the full and equal representation of all \ncountries, especially developing countries, and the meaningful participation of all \nstakeholders.  \n\nThe Pact for the Future \nA/RES/79/1\n \n49/56\n24-16433 \n \n51. We recognize international, regional, national and multi-stakeholder efforts \nunder way to advance safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems. We \nurgently need to inclusively assess and address the potential impact, opportunities and \nrisks of artificial intelligence systems on sustainable development and the well-being \nand rights of individuals. International cooperation is required to promote \ncoordination and compatibility of emerging artificial intelligence governance \nframeworks. \n52. We commit to advance equitable and inclusive approaches to harnessing \nartificial intelligence benefits and mitigating risks in full respect of international law, \nincluding international human rights law, and taking into account other relevant \nframeworks such as the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence of \nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. 22 \n53. We recognize the immense potential of artificial intelligence systems to \naccelerate progress across all the Sustainable Development Goals. We will govern \nartificial intelligence in the public interest and ensure that the application of artificial \nintelligence fosters diverse cultures and languages and supports locally generated data \nfor the benefit of countries and communities\u2019 development. This includes, in \nparticular, international cooperation to support developing countries in building \nartificial intelligence capacities as well as efforts to address potential negative \nimpacts of emerging digital technologies on labour and employment and on the \nenvironment. \n54. We consider that international governance of artificial intelligence requires an \nagile, multidisciplinary and adaptable multi-stakeholder approach. We recognize that \nthe United Nations has an important role to play in shaping, enabling and supporting \nsuch governance. \n55. We have a unique opportunity, through this Compact, to advance international \ngovernance of artificial intelligence in ways that complement international, regional, \nnational and multi-stakeholder efforts. We will:  \n \n(a) \nAssess the future directions and implications of artificial intelligence \nsystems and promote scientific understanding (all SDGs); \n \n(b) \nSupport interoperability and compatibility of artificial intelligence \ngovernance approaches through sharing best practices and promoting common \nunderstanding (all SDGs);  \n \n(c) \nHelp to build capacities, especially in developing countries, to access, \ndevelop, use and govern artificial intelligence systems and direct them towards the \npursuit of sustainable development (all SDGs); \n \n(d) \nPromote transparency, accountability and robust human oversight of \nartificial intelligence systems in compliance with international law (all SDGs). \n56. We therefore commit to: \n \n(a) \nEstablish, within the United Nations, a multidisciplinary Independent \nInternational Scientific Panel on AI with balanced geographic representation to \npromote scientific understanding through evidence-based impact, risk and \nopportunity assessments, drawing on existing national, regional and international \ninitiatives and research networks (SDG 17);  \n__________________ \n \n22 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Records of the General \nConference, Forty-first Session, Paris, 9\u201324 November 2021, vol. 1, Resolutions, annex VII. \n\nA/RES/79/1 \nThe Pact for the Future\n \n24-16433\n50/56 \n \n \n(b) \nInitiate, within the United Nations, a Global Dialogue on AI Governance \ninvolving Governments and all relevant stakeholders which will take place in the \nmargins of existing relevant United Nations conferences and meetings (SDG 17).  \n57. We therefore request the President of the General Assembly to appoint at the  \nseventy-ninth session of the General Assembly co-facilitators, one from a developed \ncountry and one from a developing country, to identify, through an intergovernmental \nprocess and consultations with other relevant stakeholders, the terms of reference and \nmodalities for the establishment and functioning of the Independent International \nScientific Panel on AI and the Global Dialogue on AI Governance for the adoption by \nthe General Assembly. \n58. We call on standards development organizations to collaborate to promote the \ndevelopment and adoption of interoperable artificial intelligence standards that \nuphold safety, reliability, sustainability and human rights (SDGs 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 16 \nand 17). \n59. We will promote safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems that \nadvance, protect and preserve linguistic and cultural diversity and that take into \naccount multilingualism throughout the life cycle of these systems (SDGs 10 and 16). \n60. We encourage the development of international partnerships on artificial \nintelligence capacity-building to develop education and training programmes, \nincrease access to resources including open artificial intelligence models and systems, \nopen training data and compute, facilitate artificial intelligence model training and \ndevelopment, and promote the participation of micro-, small and medium-sized \nenterprises in the digital economy (SDGs 4 and 17).  \n61. We will leverage existing United Nations and multi-stakeholder mechanisms to \nsupport artificial intelligence capacity-building to bridge artificial intelligence \ndivides, facilitate access to artificial intelligence applications and build capacity in \nhigh-performance computing and related skills in developing countries (all SDGs). \n62. We will promote North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation to \nsupport the development of representative high-quality data sets, affordable compute \nresources, local solutions that reflect linguistic and cultural diversity and \nentrepreneurial ecosystems in developing countries (SDGs 4, 9, 10 and 17). \n63. We emphasize the importance of increased investment, particularly from the \nprivate sector and philanthropy, to scale up artificial intelligence capacity-building \nfor sustainable development. We request the Secretary-General, in consultation with \npotential contributors and the United Nations system, to develop innovative voluntary \nfinancing options for artificial intelligence capacity-building that take into account \nthe recommendations of the High-level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence on a \nGlobal Fund on AI and that are complementary to relevant United Nations funding \nmechanisms and to submit these for consideration by the General Assembly at the \nseventy-ninth session. \n \nFollow-up and review \n \n64.

We decide to: (a) Ensure that relevant stakeholders can meaningfully participate, in their respective roles and responsibilities, in accordance with relevant rules of procedure, in relevant United Nations processes and that Member States have access to the views and expertise of those partners; (b) Leverage existing channels and strengthen communication between United Nations intergovernmental bodies and civil society, allowing for ongoing dialogue and exchange of information; (c) Encourage the contribution of the private sector to addressing global challenges and strengthen its accountability towards the implementation of United Nations frameworks; (d) Deepen United Nations engagement with national parliaments in United Nations intergovernmental bodies and processes, in accordance with national legislation, including through building on the efforts of the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union to engage parliamentarians to maintain support for the implementation of relevant United Nations agreements and resolutions; (e) Request the Secretary-General to provide recommendations on how engagement with local and regional authorities could advance the 2030 Agenda, particularly the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals, by the end of the seventy-ninth session for Member States\u2019 consideration; (f) Enhance cooperation between the United Nations and regional, subregional and other organizations, within their respective mandates, which will be critical to maintaining international peace and security, promoting and protecting human rights and achieving sustainable development. Action 56. We will strengthen international cooperation for the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of all humanity.",
    "84": "The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 identifies the exploration and use of outer space as the province of all humankind. Humanity\u2019s reliance on space is increasing day by day and the Outer Space Treaty must be recognized as the cornerstone of the international legal regime governing outer space activities. We are living through an age of increased access to and activities in outer space. The growth in the number of objects in outer space, the return of humans to deep space, and our expanding reliance on outer space systems demand urgent action. The safe and sustainable use of space plays a critical role in the achievement of the 2030 Agenda. The opportunities for people and planet are enormous, but there are also risks that must be managed. We encourage the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to further consult on The Pact for the Future A/RES/79/1 37/56 24-16433 the proposal to hold a fourth United Nations Conference on the Peaceful Exploration of Outer Space (UNISPACE IV) in 2027. We decide to: (a) Reaffirm the importance of the widest possible adherence to and full compliance with the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and discuss the establishment of new frameworks for space traffic, space debris and space resources through the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space; (b) Invite the engagement of relevant private sector, civil society and other relevant stakeholders, where appropriate and applicable, to contribute to intergovernmental processes related to the increased safety and sustainability of outer space. 3rd plenary meeting 22 September 2024 Annex I Global Digital Compact"
