emphasizes in this regard that mitigation of \nand adaptation to climate change represent an immediate and urgent global priority; \n \n2. \nUrges Member States to adopt a climate- and environment-responsive \napproach to COVID-19 recovery efforts, including by aligning investments and \ndomestic policies with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 24 and the goals \nof the Paris Agreement for its parties, and the ultimate objective of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, in order to build back better and \naccelerate a transition to low-emission, climate-resilient, inclusive and sustainable \neconomies and societies, in this regard stresses the need to strengthen the global \nresponse to climate change by increasing the ability of countries to adapt to the \nadverse effects of climate change, fostering resilience, accelerating the full \nimplementation of all the Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda and integrating \nclimate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning, urges parties \nto the Paris Agreement to communicate or update ambitious nationally determined \ncontributions by 2020, noting that article 4, paragraph 3, of the Agreement states that \neach party\u2019s successive nationally determined contribution will represent a \nprogression beyond the party\u2019s then current nationally determined contribution and \nreflect its highest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated \nresponsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national \ncircumstances, encourages parties to formulate and communicate long-term strategies \non the basis of the best available scientific knowledge and with a view to achieving \nthe purpose of the Agreement and make financial flows consistent with a pathway \ntowards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development, and \nstresses the importance of mobilizing means of implementation from all sources, \nincluding adequate financial support, inter alia, for mitigation and adaptation, taking \ninto account the specific needs and special circumstances of developing countries, \nespecially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate \nchange; \n \n3. \nReaffirms the Paris Agreement and its early entry into force, encourages \nall the parties to the Agreement

Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including its objective, \naims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context \nof sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by holding the \nincrease in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above \npre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 \ndegrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly \nreduce the risks and impacts of climate change, increasing the ability to adapt to the \nadverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse \ngas emissions development in a manner that does not threaten food production, and \nmaking finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas \nemissions and climate-resilient development; \n \n5. \nWelcomes the nationally determined contributions submitted to date, and \nrecalls that the regular updating of such contributions will reflect the highest possible \nlevel of ambition, in the light of different national circumstances, and provide the \n__________________ \n \n24  Resolution 70/1. \n\nProtection of global climate for present \nand future generations of humankind \nA/RES/76/205\n \n7/10\n21-19256 \n \ninformation necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding, in accordance with \nthe relevant decisions; \n \n6. \nNotes with concern that, according to the synthesis report on nationally \ndetermined contributions25 recently published by the secretariat of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, the nationally determined contributions \npresented thus far by the parties to the Paris Agreement are not sufficient and that \naction is needed to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below \n2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the \ntemperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, underlines the \nimportance of the request in decision 1/CP.2126 of the Conference of the Parties to the \nConvention to the Parties to the Paris Agreement, as appropriate, to communicate or \nupdate by 2020 their nationally determined contributions, and also notes with concern \nthe findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the first part of the \nSixth Assessment Report entitled Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis, \nin which the Intergovernmental Panel indicates that global warming of 1.5 degrees \nCelsius and 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will be exceeded during the \ntwenty-first century, unless deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions occur in the \ncoming decades; \n \n7. \nStresses the urgent need to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen \nresilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change and extreme weather events, and \nin this regard urges Member States to continue to engage in adaptation planning \nprocesses and to enhance cooperation, namely disaster risk reduction; \n \n8. \nWelcomes the Paris Agreement work programme, commonly referred to as \nthe Katowice Rulebook, adopted at the third part of the first session of the Conference \nof the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to

Recognizes that enhanced access to international climate finance is \nimportant to support mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries, \nespecially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate \nchange, and also recognizes the ongoing efforts in this regard; \n \n13. Notes with deep regret that the goal of developed countries party to \nmobilize jointly 100 billion United States dollars per year by 2020 in the context of \nmeaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation has not yet been \nmet, while welcoming the increased pledges made by many developed countries party \n__________________ \n \n25  FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/8/Rev.1. \n \n26  See FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1. \n \n27  See FCCC/CP/2018/10/Add.1. \n \n28  A/75/256, sect.
