the Information Society, and all the outcomes of the World \nSummit on the Information Society, including the Geneva Declaration of Principles, 2 \nthe Geneva Plan of Action,3 the Tunis Commitment4 and the Tunis Agenda for the \nInformation Society,5 \n \nRecognizing that the focus of the present resolution is on regional and national \ncooperation in Central Asia on artificial intelligence, bearing in mind that the focus \nof the resolution is on artificial intelligence capacity-building in the non\u2011military \ndomain and does not touch upon the development or use of artificial intelligence for \nmilitary purposes, \n \nAcknowledging the transformative impact of artificial intelligence in Central \nAsia, and commending countries of the region for their significant efforts in the \ndevelopment and implementation of artificial intelligence, including the adoption of \nnational strategies such as the strategy for artificial intelligence development until \n2040 of Tajikistan, the 2024 artificial intelligence development strategy of Uzbekistan \nand the concept for artificial intelligence development for 2024\u20132029 of Kazakhstan, \nas well as the establishment of innovation hubs such as the Astana Hub and the High-\nTechnology Park of Kyrgyzstan, \n \nTaking into consideration the unique context of Central Asia, with its diverse \neconomies, rich cultural heritage and strategic geographical location, and \nacknowledging the potential of artificial intelligence to address specific challenges \nand opportunities in the region in agriculture, industry, trade, finance, healthcare and \nother sectors to ensure an inclusive, open, sustainable, fair, safe and secure digital \nfuture for all, \n \nEncouraging Member States and inviting multi-stakeholders from all regions \nand countries, within their respective roles and responsibilities, including from the \nprivate sector, international and regional organizations, civil society, the media, \nacademia and research institutions and technical communities and individuals, to \ndevelop and support regulatory and governance approaches and frameworks related \nto safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems that create an enabling \necosystem at all levels, including for innovation, entrepreneurship and the \ndissemination of knowledge and technologies on mutually agreed terms, recognizing \nthat effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and multi-\nstakeholders is necessary in developing such approaches and frameworks, \n \nRecognizing that the lack of digital infrastructure connectivity and skills, \nincluding education, expertise and human capacity, remains a fundamental challenge \nin many developing countries, including Central Asian countries, which can \ncontribute to artificial intelligence and other digital divides, including different levels \nof readiness to make use of and benefit from artificial intelligence, \n \nNoting the important role of Central Asian countries in advancing scientific and \neducational initiatives, including the work of research centres and universities and \ntheir contributions to training qualified specialists for the digital economy, and in this \nregard noting the forthcoming international conference on artificial intelligence in \neducation to be held in Ashgabat in late August 2025, in cooperation with the Institute \nfor Information Technologies in Education of the United Nations Educational, \nScientific and Cultural Organization, \n_______________

access to the \nbenefits of artificial intelligence, therefore stressing the importance of providing \nadequate public and private financing, mobilizing action-oriented means of \nimplementation, such as knowledge-sharing activities and the transfer of technology \non mutually agreed terms, and capacity-building assistance for developing countries, \nincluding Central Asian countries, in line with their national needs, policies and \npriorities, \n \nNoting the important role that international, regional and subregional \norganizations and international financial institutions, the private sector, companies, \ncivil society, the media, academia and research institutions and technical communities \nand individuals, and other relevant stakeholders could play in enhancing artificial \nintelligence capacity-building and promoting safe, secure and trustworthy artificial \nintelligence systems for sustainable development, \n \n1. \nEncourages Member States, in particular developed countries and those \ndeveloping countries in a position to do so, with the contribution of the relevant \nstakeholders, within their respective roles and responsibilities, to increase capacity-\nbuilding cooperation, including policy exchanges, knowledge-sharing activities and \nthe transfer of technology on mutually agreed terms, technical assistance, lifelong \nlearning, personnel training, skilling of the workforce, international research \ncooperation, voluntary joint international research laboratories and artificial \nintelligence capacity-building centres, with full consideration of developing \ncountries\u2019 national needs, policies and priorities, and to hold training courses, \nseminars and workshops, among others, for sharing experiences and best practices; \n \n2. \nEncourages Central Asian countries to develop appropriate metrics and \nmechanisms at the national and regional levels to support the deployment of \nresponsible and inclusive artificial intelligence systems, and the evaluation of the \nimpact of these systems in creating new opportunities for sustainable development in \nthe region; \n \n3. \nEncourages the development of international partnerships on artificial \nintelligence capacity-building to develop education and training programmes, \nincrease access to resources including open artificial intelligence models and systems, \nopen training data and compute, facilitate artificial intelligence model training and \ndevelopment, and promote the participation of micro-, small and medium-sized \nenterprises in the digital economy, and notes the initiative on the establishment of a \nregional artificial intelligence centre in Dushanbe, to contribute, among other things, \nto the creation of new opportunities for sustainable development in Central Asia; \n \n4. \nNotes the formulation of regional self-regulatory measures in Central Asia \naimed at promoting safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems and \nensuring a balance between regulation and innovation; \n \n5. \nInvites United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, within their \nrespective mandates, to collaborate in assisting Member States, including Central \nAsian countries, in designing artificial intelligence capacity-building programmes, at \nthe national and regional levels, and to foster public-private partnerships to mobilize \nadditional resources; \n \n6. \nSupports the United Nations in playing a central and coordinating role in \ninternational development cooperation; \n\nA/RES/79/322 \nRole of artificial
