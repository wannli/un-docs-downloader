Notes that the global macroeconomic outlook remains highly uncertain, \nand is particularly bleak for many developing countries, including a large number of \nleast developed countries, faced with growing debt service burdens and tight fiscal \nconstraints, and that such a finance divide will, if left unaddressed, translate into a \nlasting sustainable development divide; and calls for improved international debt \nmechanisms to support debt review, debt payment suspensions, and debt \nrestructuring, as appropriate, with an expansion of support and eligibility to \nvulnerable countries in need; \n \n21.
