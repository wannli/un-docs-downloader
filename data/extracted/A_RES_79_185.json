that March 2024 marked 13 years since the peaceful uprising \nand its brutal repression that led to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, which \nhas had and continues to have a devastating impact on civilians, including through \ngrave violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations of \ninternational humanitarian law,  \n \nStrongly condemning the grave human rights

gas, and \nsulfur mustard, which are prohibited under international law, and acts of violence by \nthe Syrian regime that foment sectarian tensions within the Syrian population, \n \nWelcoming the work of the Investigation and Identification Team of the \nOrganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, noting its findings in its four \nreports to date, including its report of January 2023 which found reasonable grounds \nto believe that the chemical weapons attack in Douma on 7 April 2018 was perpetrated \nby the Syrian Arab Republic and found that Russian forces were co-located at the \nbase in the Syrian Arab Republic from which the Syrian regime launched the attack \non Douma as well as its report of February 2024 which found reasonable grounds to \nbelieve that, on 1 September 2015, during sustained attacks aimed at capturing the \ntown of Mari\u2019, units of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as \nDa\u2019esh) deployed sulfur mustard, and anticipating the publication of its reports on \nother chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian Arab Republic,  \n \nCondemning in the strongest possible terms the repeated use of chemical \nweapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, including the instances independently \nattributed by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United \nNations Joint Investigative Mechanism and the Investigation and Identification Team \nof the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, noting that the Joint \nInvestigative Mechanism determined that the Syrian Arab Armed Forces had been \nresponsible for attacks that released toxic substances in 2014 and 2015 and that \nIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Da\u2019esh) had used sulfur \nmustard in 2015 and 2016, and further concluded in October 2017 that the Syrian \nArab Air Force had been responsible for the use of chemical weapons on 4 April 2017 \nin Khan Shaykhun, and noting also that the Investigation and Identification Team \nconcluded in April 2020 that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian \nAir Force had carried out three chemical weapons attacks in Ltamenah in March 2017 \nand further concluded in April 2021 that there were reasonable grounds to believe the \nSyrian Air Force had carried out a chemical weapons attack in Saraqib in February \n2018 and further concluded in January 2023 that there were reasonable grounds to \nbelieve the Syrian Arab Air Force had carried out a chemical weapons attack in Douma \non 7 April 2018 and found that Russian forces were co-located at the base in the Syrian \nArab Republic from which the Syrian regime launched the attack on Douma, \n \nNoting with grave concern that the Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Human Rights, in a report of June 2022, has identified 306,887 \ncivilians by full name, together with an established date of death and location, who \nwere killed in the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic between March 2011 and \nMarch 2022 and that, of those identified, 26,727 were women and 27,126 were \nchildren, recalling also that the list compiled by the Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Human Rights indicates a minimum verifiable number and is \ncertainly an undercount of the actual number of killings,  \n \nRecalling its demand that all parties, especially the Syrian regime, take all \nappropriate steps to protect civilians, including members of ethnic and religious \ncommunities, \n \nReiterating that the only sustainable solution to the current crisis in the Syrian \nArab Republic is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, including the \nwork of the Constitutional Committee under the auspices of the United Nations, that \nmeets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people in line with Security Council \nresolution 2254 (2015) of 18 December 2015, with a view to establishing credible, \ninclusive and non-sectarian governance,

recognizing the work carried \nout by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria to that end, \n \nExpressing grave concern that the cross-border authorizations in Security \nCouncil resolutions 2642 (2022) of 12 July 2022 and 2672 (2023) of 9 January 2023 \nhave not yet been extended, \n \nNoting with great concern that, following the reduction of Security Council-\nauthorized cross-border access in January and July 2020, Security Council \nauthorization expired entirely in July 2023, despite growing humanitarian needs, \nespecially in the north-west of the Syrian Arab Republic, where aid access remains a \nlifeline for 4.1 million people, especially following the devastating earthquakes of \nFebruary 2023, \n \nReiterating the urgent need to work to maintain the current level of international \nhumanitarian assistance to the Syrian Arab Republic and to strengthen efforts to \naddress the humanitarian situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, including through

(2021) of 9 July 2021, 2642 (2022) and 2672 (2023), \n \nWelcoming the efforts of the Special Envoy to advance United Nations efforts \nto achieve a sustainable political solution to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic \nin line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), recalling the importance of \nadvancing the work of the Constitutional Committee and achieving tangible results, \nand in that regard urging all parties, particularly the Syrian regime, to engage \nmeaningfully in the political process under the auspices of the Special Envoy and his \noffice in Geneva, including the work of the Constitutional Committee, and to convene \nthe next round of the Constitutional Committee as soon as possible under the auspices \nof the United Nations, and underlining that a political

\nconflict, face increased violations and abuses of their human rights including by \nHay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham, and continue to be among the worst affected and on multiple \ngrounds, including given that many women have become the main or sole \nbreadwinners for their families, a situation that may be exacerbated by the enforced \ndisappearance of their loved ones, while facing increased caregiving responsibilities \nand alarming levels of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, \n \nAffirming continued support for the exercise by Syrians of their rights of \npeaceful assembly and association and freedom of opinion and expression both online \nand offline, including through peaceful demonstrations across the country such as in \nSuwayda\u2019 and Idlib, urging all involved to refrain from violence, and condemning any \nunlawful or excessive use of force against peaceful protesters, including the use of \nregime gunfire on demonstrators resulting in the death and injury of civilians and the \nregime\u2019s continued practice of slandering, arresting, torturing and forcibly \ndisappearing peaceful protesters, \n \nNoting with deep concern the culture of persistent and pervasive impunity from \nwithin the Syrian regime for the most serious violations of international law and \nviolations and abuses of human rights law committed during the present
