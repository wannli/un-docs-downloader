Moratorium on the use of the death penalty \n \n \n \nThe General Assembly, \n \nGuided by the purposes and principles contained in the Charter of the United \nNations, \n \nReaffirming the Universal

December 2008, 65/206 of 21 December 2010, 67/176 of 20 December 2012, \n69/186 of 18 December 2014, 71/187 of 19 December 2016, 73/175 of 17 December \n2018, 75/183 of 16 December 2020 and 77/222 of

and resolutions of the Human Rights \nCouncil, the most recent of which was resolution 54/35 of 13 October 2023,6 \n \nMindful that any miscarriage or failure of justice in the implementation of the \ndeath penalty is irreversible and irreparable, \n \nConvinced that a moratorium on the use of the death penalty contributes to \nrespect for human dignity and to the enhancement and progressive development of \nhuman rights, and considering that there is no conclusive evidence of the deterrent \nvalue of the death penalty, \n \nNoting ongoing local and national debates and regional initiatives on the death \npenalty, as well as the readiness of an increasing number of Member States to make \navailable to the public information on the use of the death penalty, and also, in this \nregard, the decision by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 26/2 of 26 June \n20147 to convene biennial high-level panel discussions in order to further exchange \nviews on the question of the death penalty, \n \nRecognizing the role of national human rights institutions and civil society in \ncontributing to ongoing local and national debates and regional initiatives on the \ndeath penalty,  \n \nNoting the long-term reductions in reported executions, as well as the increase \nin commutations of death sentences, and welcoming all measures taken by States \ntowards limiting the application of the death penalty, \n \nExpressing with deep concern that, despite the global trend towards limiting the \napplication of the death penalty, there has been a recent surge in reported executions, \n \nEmphasizing the need to ensure that persons facing the death penalty have \naccess to justice without discrimination of any kind, including access to legal counsel, \nthat they are treated with humanity and with respect for their inherent dignity and in \ncompliance with their rights under international human rights law, and to improve \nconditions in prisons in accordance with international standards, notably the United \nNations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela \nRules)8 and the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and \nNon-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok Rules), 9 \n \nNoting with deep concern that, as shown in recent reports of the Secretary-\nGeneral, frequently, poor and economically vulnerable persons, foreign nationals, \npersons exercising their human rights and persons belonging to religious or ethnic \nminorities are disproportionately represented among those sentenced to the death \npenalty and the discriminatory application of the death penalty, to women, 10 \n \nNoting that transparent reporting and access to information regarding the use of \nthe death penalty and criminal prosecutions can expose discriminatory practices or \nimpact in the imposition and application of the death penalty, and recalling that, \nparticularly in cases of capital punishment, States must guarantee transparency in \norder to ensure that all persons benefit from due process guarantees, \n \nNoting also the negative impact that the imposition of the death penalty has on \nthe rights of children whose parents or parental caregivers face the death penalty, as \nwell as other family members, \n__________________ \n \n6 See Official Records of the General
