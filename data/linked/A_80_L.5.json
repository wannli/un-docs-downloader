  "paragraphs": {
    "1": "We, Heads of State and Government and high representatives, have gathered in Doha from 4 to 6 November 2025 at the Second World Summit for Social Development to build a more just, inclusive, equitable and sustainable world, by addressing gaps, assessing progress and recommitting to the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development1 and their implementation, and give momentum towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.2",
    "2": "We acknowledge the urgent need to address profound social challenges, especially poverty, unemployment and social exclusion, that affect every country. It is our task to address both their underlying and structural causes and their distressing consequences in accordance with international law, including human rights obligations, in order to reduce uncertainty, inequality and insecurity.",
    "3": "We recognize that the three core themes of social development, namely, poverty eradication, promotion of full and productive employment and decent work for all and social integration, are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, and that an enabling environment therefore needs to be created so that all three objectives can be pursued simultaneously.",
    "4": "We share the conviction that social development and social justice are indispensable for the achievement and maintenance of peace and security within and among our nations. In turn, social development and social justice cannot be attained in the absence of peace and security or in the absence of respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms.",
    "5": "We meet 30 years after the first World Summit for Social Development and days after the commemoration of the eightieth anniversary of the United Nations, with a determination to promote social development and social justice anchored in a strengthened and effective multilateral system, and we reaffirm and remain guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.",
    "6": "We recommit to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, as they remain relevant and valid, and the further initiatives for social development adopted by the General Assembly, including at its twenty-fourth special session,3 and to a continued global dialogue on social development issues.",
    "7": "We reaffirm the full, timely and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals, upholding all the principles enshrined in it, including the promise to leave no one behind and reach the furthest behind first, and to place people at the centre of development, with due consideration of the needs of present and future generations, and a strong commitment to safeguarding our planet.",
    "8": "We also reaffirm the intergovernmental commitments related to social development, including those in the political declarations of the Sustainable Development Goals Summits held in 2019 and 2023, 4 as well as the relevant commitments in the Pact for the Future and its annexes. 5",
    "9": "We reaffirm the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development6 as an integral part of the 2030 Agenda. We are committed to its full implementation, which is critical for the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals and their targets.",
    "10": "We welcome the outcome document of the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development, the Sevilla Commitment, 7 which renews the global financing for development framework, building on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and call for its timely and effective implementation.",
    "11": "We reaffirm that the pursuit and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, encompassing civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, which includes the right to development, must be respected, protected and promoted, without distinction or discrimination of any kind.",
    "12": "We reaffirm that the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, remains the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.",
    "13": "We stress the need to take urgent and ambitious climate action in the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 8 and the Paris Agreement 9 in relation to climate mitigation, adaptation and the provision of the means of implementation, especially finance to developing countries.",
    "14": "We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 10 including, inter alia, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, as set out in principle 7 thereof.",
    "15": "We gather here in Doha at a summit of renewed hope, driven by commitment and collective action. While facing urgent and complex challenges, we see new opportunities. We are convinced that meaningful progress is possible through genuine solidarity, effective multilateralism and inclusive international cooperation, taking into account national realities and regional contexts, particularly in developing countries.",
    "16": "We remain committed to a political, economic, ethical and spiritual vision for social development that is based on human dignity, human rights, equality, respect, peace, democracy, mutual responsibility and cooperation, and full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people.",
    "17": "We welcome the progress made towards the full implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action through concerted action at the national, regional and global levels. The global wealth of nations has grown significantly since 1995 and international trade has grown even more. Global labour productivity has increased, and the global unemployment rate has reached a historic low. Extreme poverty has been reduced and access to education, healthcare and social protection has improved considerably.",
    "18": "Yet, 30 years after the convening of the World Summit for Social Development, progress remains slow and uneven, and major gaps and inequalities persist within and among countries. With only five years remaining until the 2030 deadline, progress towards achieving most of the Sustainable Development Goals has been far too slow, with some goals stalled or even regressing despite notable advances in a few areas: (a) Although great strides have been made in reducing poverty since 1995, in recent years progress has slowed, and millions of people still live in extreme poverty and over 1 billion people endure poverty in different forms and dimensions. Children, women, persons with disabilities, people living in rural areas and those in vulnerable situations experience higher poverty rates than the rest of the population. Hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition are still a reality, with global undernourishment rising in recent years. While access to education has expanded, still too many children are out of school; (b) In addition, while millions have been lifted out of poverty, billions of people live close to the poverty line and face a constant risk of falling into extreme poverty. Despite significant global progress in gradually expanding social protection coverage, including social protection floors, almost 4 billion people still lack access to any form of social protection, including nearly 2 billion children; (c) Millions of workers continue to live in poverty, earning wages and incomes that are not sufficient for an adequate standard of living or to sustain their families. Informal employment remains pervasive, with billions of people making their living in the informal economy. Women and young people are disproportionately engaged in informal and precarious employment. Furthermore, progress towards ending child labour is too slow; (d) Millions of youth do not have access to education, employment or training, the majority of whom are young women. In the labour market, young people, especially youth with disabilities, experience higher levels of unemployment, informal employment and working poverty. These decent work deficits can have long- lasting consequences on poverty eradication efforts and affect the well-being of current and future generations; (e) Today, inequality has reached staggering levels. Since 1995, income inequality has increased in many countries, developed and developing. Global wage gaps remain significant. Gender inequality is deeply entrenched. On average, women earn less than men and millions of women worldwide are outside the labour force; (f) Persons with disabilities continue to be more likely to live in poverty, are underemployed and unemployed, and face additional disability-related costs, including medical costs, as well as other significant and persistent social and economic barriers to inclusion in society; (g) Digital divides within and among countries persist, particularly in rural and remote areas. Billions of people currently do not have connectivity, access to the Internet and lack digital skills. Digital infrastructure, connectivity and access to the Internet in developing countries, particularly least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, remain challenging; (h) Multiple, persistent and new challenges are reversing social development gains, including geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, economic crises, inequalities within and among countries, climate change, natural hazards and disasters, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, water scarcity, desertification, pollution, conflict-induced famine and starvation, humanitarian emergencies and forced displacement of people, refugee crisis, pandemics and other health emergencies, gender inequality, racial discrimination, uneven technological advancements, unsustainable debt burdens and unequal access to technology and capital; (i) Complex and interrelated opportunities, challenges and risks related to demographic shifts remain, including rapid population growth, declining birth rates and population ageing. Between 2024 and 2030, the number of persons aged 60 years or over is globally projected to outnumber youth, and this increase will be the greatest and the most rapid in the developing world.",
    "19": "While these problems are global in character and affect all countries, we clearly acknowledge that each country faces specific challenges in its pursuit of sustainable development. We recognize the special challenges facing all developing countries, in particular, African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, as well as the specific challenges facing middle-income countries and countries in conflict and post-conflict situations.",
    "20": "We commit to support and implement the relevant development agendas, strategies and programmes of action for countries in special situations, including the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries, 11 the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024\u2013203412 and the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States, 13 and reaffirm our support for the achievement of the African Union Agenda 2063. We look forward to the elaboration of a specific inter-agency, comprehensive, system-wide response plan for middle-income countries by the United Nations development system.",
    "21": "We are convinced that addressing today\u2019s challenges to social development requires strengthening international solidarity, upholding human rights, building trust, and a renewed commitment to multilateral action on the attainment of social development and the implementation of the sustainable development agenda in its social, economic and environmental dimensions. We will advance innovative solutions and inclusive international cooperation to fully translate the commitments of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action and the social dimension of the 2030 Agenda into concrete actions to achieve social development for all, in particular to the benefit of developing countries.",
    "22": "We reaffirm that the Commission for Social Development has the primary responsibility for the follow-up to the Summit and review of the implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action.",
    "23": "We recognize that the multilateral system and its institutions, with the United Nations and its Charter at the centre, must be strengthened to keep pace with a changing world and address global challenges in the sphere of social development. They must be fit for the present and the future \u2013 effective and capable, just, democratic, equitable and representative of today\u2019s world, inclusive, interconnected and financially stable.",
    "24": "We will explore bold and effective social policies that are woven into a whole- of-government, whole-of-society, people-centred and integrated approaches aimed at achieving social development for all, including through enhancing social policy coherence, building effective, accountable, transparent and inclusive institutions at all levels, achieving social justice for all, upholding democracy, the rule of law, good governance and access to justice, combating all forms of corruption and reinforcing national coordination, as well as multi-stakeholder engagement and integrated responses to social development challenges, and avoiding policy silos across sectors.",
    "25": "We recognize the contributions of multi-stakeholder engagement to social development. We will continue to collaborate meaningfully with all relevant stakeholders, including civil society, social partners and the private sector, and encourage multi-stakeholder collaboration and partnerships.",
    "26": "On the basis of our common pursuit of social development, which is aimed at social justice, solidarity, harmony and equality, within and among countries, guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, as well as policy objectives, development priorities and religious and cultural diversity, and full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms, we reaffirm our global drive for social progress and development.",
    "27": "We strive for a future that is inclusive, resilient, sustainable and just. We envisage a world free of poverty, hunger, unemployment, preventable diseases, racism, discrimination and insecurity and a world of equality, equity, shared prosperity and peace, where the dignity of all people is respected, and where no one is left behind.
