    "1": "Reaffirms that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, expresses profound alarm that the emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise globally, remains deeply concerned that all countries, particularly developing countries, are vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and are already experiencing an increase in such impacts, including persistent drought and extreme weather events, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion, ocean acidification and changes to the cryosphere, including the melting and retreat of glaciers, such as mountain glaciers, further threatening food security, water availability and livelihoods, and efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions and achieve sustainable development, recognizes the substantial risks posed by climate change to health, and emphasizes in this regard that mitigation of and adaptation to climate change represent an immediate and urgent global priority;",
    "2": "Urges Member States to adopt a climate- and environment-responsive approach to COVID-19 recovery efforts, including by aligning investments and domestic policies with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 28 the goals of the Paris Agreement for its parties and the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in order to achieve a sustainable, resilient and inclusive recovery, and accelerate a transition to low-emission, climate-resilient, inclusive and sustainable economies and societies, in this regard stresses the need to strengthen the global response to climate change by increasing the ability of countries to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, fostering resilience, accelerating the full implementation of all the Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda and integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning, urges parties to the Paris Agreement to communicate or update ambitious nationally determined contributions, noting that article 4, paragraph 3, of the Agreement states that each party\u2019s successive nationally determined contribution will represent a progression beyond the party\u2019s then current nationally determined contribution and reflect its highest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, encourages parties to formulate and communicate long-term strategies on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge and with a view to achieving the purpose of the Agreement and making financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development, and stresses the importance of mobilizing means of implementation from all sources, including adequate financial support, inter alia, for mitigation and adaptation, taking into account the specific needs and special circumstances of developing countries, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change;",
