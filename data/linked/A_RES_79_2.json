    "1": " healthy environment, and advance the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;1",
    "2": "Reaffirm that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development offers a framework to ensure healthy lives, and recall commitments to fight malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis, the Ebola virus disease, neglected tropical diseases and other communicable diseases and epidemics that disproportionately affect developing countries, including by addressing growing antimicrobial resistance, while reiterating that antimicrobial resistance challenges the sustainability and effectiveness of the public health response to these and other diseases as well as gains in health and development and the attainment of the 2030 Agenda;",
    "3": "Recall that, within the broader context of antimicrobial resistance, resistance to antibiotics is a grave global challenge, and that effective, safe and affordable antibiotics are a prerequisite for providing quality, accessible and timely healthcare services and are essential for the functioning of all health systems;",
    "4": "Recognize that, while antimicrobial resistance affects people of all ages, knows no borders and is present in all countries, the burden is largely and disproportionately borne by developing countries and those in vulnerable situations, requiring global solidarity, joint efforts and international cooperation;",
    "5": "Note with concern that lack of access to appropriate, safe, effective and affordable antimicrobials and diagnostic tools, particularly in developing countries, is responsible for more deaths than antimicrobial resistance, while stressing that, in 2019, 4.95 million deaths were associated with drug-resistant bacterial infections, including 1.27 million deaths directly attributable to bacterial antimicrobial resistance, 20 per cent of whom were children under 5, 2 and that without a stronger response there will be an estimated average loss of life expectancy of 1.8 years globally by 2035;3",
    "6": "Note with concern also that, globally, antimicrobial resistance could result in 1 trillion United States dollars of additional healthcare costs per year by 2050 and 1 trillion to 3.4 trillion dollars of gross domestic product losses per year by 2030, 4 and that treating drug-resistant bacterial infections alone could cost up to 412 billion dollars annually, coupled with workforce participation and productivity losses of 443 billion dollars,5 with antimicrobial resistance predicted to cause an 11 per cent decline in livestock production in low-income countries by 2050;6",
    "7": "Note with serious concern the severe shortcomings the coronavirus disease (COVID\u201119) pandemic has revealed at the national, regional and global levels in terms of timely, effective prevention, preparedness, detection of and response to potential health emergencies, and consequently the challenges this creates for effectively tackling antimicrobial resistance, including in the capacity and resilience of all health systems, especially in developing countries;",
    "8": "Reaffirm that improving infection prevention and control measures, vaccination and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) could prevent more than 750,000 deaths each year from antimicrobial resistance in low- and middle-income countries alone, and that prioritizing good antimicrobial stewardship, universal health coverage and equitable access to medicines, diagnostics and other health products, investment in infrastructure, and education, including public awareness campaigns and training, will further serve to prevent all infections;",
    "9": "Recognize the need to scale up multisectoral, cross-sectoral and interdisciplinary efforts and the engagement of all relevant sectors to address antimicrobial resistance in human, animal and plant health, such as agriculture, environment, finance, manufacturing, research and development, and education to generate an effective whole-of-government and whole-of-society response, in line with a One Health approach;",

    "15": "Recognize the profound socioeconomic challenges and financial hardships faced by people affected by antimicrobial resistance, including in obtaining an early diagnosis, in being subject to extremely long treatment regimens, with drugs that could involve severe side effects, as well as in securing integrated support, including from the community, and therefore affirm that all these people require integrated, people-centred prevention, diagnosis, treatment, management of side effects, and care, as well as psychosocial, nutritional and socioeconomic support for successful treatment, including to reduce stigma and discrimination;",
    "16": "Commit to scale up action to be commensurate with the present burden of antimicrobial resistance, with the aim of reducing the global deaths associated with bacterial antimicrobial resistance by 10 per cent by 2030 against the 2019 baseline of 4.95 million deaths, and undertake to address the multifaceted and cross-cutting nature of antimicrobial resistance; I. Governance",
    "17": "Recognize that sustainable, efficient and accountable governance structures at local, national, regional and global levels are critical to an effective, coordinated and inclusive multisectoral response, including through a One Health approach, and note, from annual Tracking Antimicrobial Resistance Country Self- Assessment Survey (TrACSS) reporting, that, while 178 countries have developed multisectoral national action plans on antimicrobial resistance, only 52 per cent of countries have a functioning multisectoral coordinating mechanism and only 68 per cent are implementing their action plans;",
    "18": "Reaffirm the importance of national ownership and the primary role and responsibility of governments at all levels to determine their own path towards achieving universal health coverage, including through addressing antimicrobial resistance, in accordance with national contexts, priorities and needs, and underscore the importance of political leadership for tackling antimicrobial resistance in and beyond the health sector in order to pursue whole-of-government, whole-of-society and community-based approaches, as well as the consideration of health-in-all- policies, equity-based and life-course approaches;",
    "19": "Recognize that, although progress has been made in developing and implementing multisectoral national action plans on antimicrobial resistance, additional and sustainable financial and technical support is needed to build and strengthen capacity, especially in developing countries;",
    "20": "Recognize that armed conflicts have a devastating impact on health systems and antimicrobial resistance, leaving people, especially people in vulnerable situations, refugees, internally displaced persons and those living in occupied territories or conflict-affected areas, without full access to essential healthcare and exposing them to preventable diseases and other health risks, and exacerbate health needs, including for mental health and psychosocial support, rehabilitation, treatment for chronic diseases and others such as cancer, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis;",
