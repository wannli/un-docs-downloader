    "7": "Calls on all States, in particular the nuclear-weapon States to commit to further identifying, exploring and implementing effective risk reduction measures necessary to mitigate risks relating to nuclear weapons use that arise from miscalculation, misperception, miscommunication or accident, inter alia, to intensify dialogue among and between the nuclear-weapon States and with the non-nuclear weapons States; to develop and make every effort to implement effective crisis prevention and management arrangements, mechanisms and tools; to maintain the practice of not targeting each other or any other state with nuclear weapons and keep them at the lowest possible alert levels,",
    "8": "Calls on all States to strengthen support for initiatives to develop multilateral disarmament verification and capacity-building in support of nuclear disarmament and as an effective step towards achieving the objectives of Article VI of the NPT, and to further conceptual and practical work on nuclear disarmament verification, taking into account the importance of partnerships between nuclear- weapon States and non-nuclear-weapon States on this matter and encourage broad participation by all States,",
