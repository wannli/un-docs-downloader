  "title": "76/258. Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries",
  "paragraphs": {
    "1": "Forty years ago, in September 1981, the international community met in Paris for the First United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries and launched the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries with an ambitious objective of transforming the economies of the least developed countries towards self-sustained development and enabling them to provide at least internationally accepted minimum standards of nutrition, health, transport, communication, social infrastructure, including drinking water and sanitation, housing and education, as well as job opportunities for their citizens, in particular the rural and urban poor.",
    "2": "Now, we are meeting for the fifth time, in the most unprecedented of circumstances, in which a health and socioeconomic crisis has shaken everyone, individually and collectively. The world is plagued by growing poverty, hunger and malnutrition, inequality, human rights violations, digital divides, vaccine divides, complex humanitarian emergencies and armed conflict, insecurity, pandemics, environmental degradation, climate change and disasters. Of greatest concern is that one in three people in least developed countries still live in extreme poverty, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused this figure to rise further. We are determined to foster peaceful, just and inclusive societies that are free from fear and violence. There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development.",
    "3": "We call for greater action and extraordinary measures by all countries and strengthened international and multilateral cooperation to address challenges affecting least developed countries on the basis of the concept of human security 1 and to ensure that no one is left behind.",
    "4": "We have entered the decade of action to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals, the most critical time of our generation, to realize our collective ambitions of sustainable and inclusive recovery and increased resilience from COVID-19 in a sustainable and equitable manner and leaving no one behind. We reaffirm our commitment to enhancing our efforts from COVID-19 to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development and the Paris Agreement. We commit to taking more tangible steps to support the least developed countries in this endeavour and to reach the furthest behind first, recognizing the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on those in vulnerable situations.",
    "5": "The least developed countries saw their economies significantly shrink in 2020, amid a severe global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The external debt burden and debt service obligations are rising significantly, gains made over the past decade in poverty reduction were wiped out, there were increases in food insecurity and malnutrition, and already fragile health systems saw resources shifted away from urgent health and life-saving treatments. Disrupted education is likely to have a lasting negative impact on countries\u2019 recovery and development. Global inequalities are being exposed and growing as a result of the pandemic, increasing the risk of conflict and fragility, with women and girls, young people, persons with disabilities, older persons, indigenous peoples, local communities, refugees, displaced persons and migrants disproportionately affected. While many advanced economies deployed massive fiscal stimuli to cushion the pandemic\u2019s impact and have applied adjusted health measures, the policy response in least developed countries was much more limited owing to weak fiscal conditions, major supply chain and logistic challenges, weak resilience capacity and static global support. For them, adequate access to vaccines remains many months, if not years, away, casting a shadow over their urgent and much-needed growth and development prospects.",
    "6": "The COVID-19 pandemic threatens not only to reverse some progress made during the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011\u20132020, (Istanbul Programme of Action) but also to exacerbate persistent challenges in least developed countries. Global inequality has risen as a result of the pandemic, and the risk of conflict and fragility has increased, in particular in relation to democratic governance and the rule of law. Owing to pre-existing conditions, namely, chronic underinvestment in health systems, poorly functioning food systems, weak social protection systems, lack of institutional capacity, high levels of vulnerability to external shocks and employment that is predominantly in the informal sector, the pandemic has caused serious negative effects on all priority areas of the Istanbul Programme of Action that will be felt for years to come. This might have a negative impact on the graduation process of some countries.",
    "7": "We recognize that the least developed countries, currently consisting of 46 nations and comprising some 14 per cent of the global population, are some of the poorest and most vulnerable in the world, accounting for only 1.3 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP), 1.4 per cent of global foreign direct investment (FDI) and just under 1 per cent of global merchandising exports.",
    "8": "We recognize that, notwithstanding many challenges and constraints, the least developed countries represent an enormous human, cultural and natural resource potential for sustainable economic growth, welfare, peace, prosperity, and food and energy security. Millions of young people and a growing working-age population could become development leaders and the drivers of transformative change. It is imperative that action for the least developed countries by all stakeholders be aimed at addressing the challenges in a sustainable manner and leveraging the opportunities offered by new and emerging issues to catalyse the greatest multiplier effects on growth and development. Therefore, a strengthened and inclusive global partnership that effectively addresses the special needs of the least developed countries will contribute to the causes of people, planet, peace, prosperity, partnership and sustainable development for all.",
    "9": "We also recognize that many least developed countries continue to face multiple structural challenges and constraints, including narrow production and export bases, stagnant trade and investment flows, diminishing productivity growth, small size, isolation and remoteness from major markets, widespread poverty, hunger and malnutrition, lack of access to quality and inclusive education and lifelong learning opportunities, and underdeveloped human capital. Almost half of the least developed countries are landlocked or small island countries, with a weak land and natural resource base. These long-standing challenges are compounded by new and emerging challenges, brought about by climate change, increased incidences of disasters and public health emergencies, conflicts, fluctuating commodity prices and rising capital outflows. Without a structural transformation that prioritizes economic diversification and addresses institutional and capacity constraints, the least developed countries will remain vulnerable to various socioeconomic, health and environmental shocks.",
    "10": " and mobile Internet, increased enrolment of girls and boys in primary education, increased access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, and reforms that have made it easier to start and register businesses.",
    "11": "We also recognize that progress has been made towards graduation from the least developed country category. However, there remain significant challenges in meeting the graduation criteria and in ensuring sustainable and irreversible graduation. The Istanbul Programme of Action set the goal of half of the least developed countries, of which there were 24 at the time, meeting graduation criteria by 2020. To date, 4 have graduated and 16 are at different stages of graduation.",
    "12": "We note with concern that progress fell short of the goals and targets set out in the Istanbul Programme of Action, including achieving sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth at a 7 per cent rate; poverty eradication, achieving structural transformation; doubling the share of trade, building productive capacity; securing full employment and decent work for all, reducing the number of children, in particular girls, out of school in primary and secondary education, which remains at least double the world average; manufacturing and trade gains, which were minimal and concentrated in only a handful of countries; tax-to-GDP ratios that increased very slowly; and disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.",
    "13": "We note with concern that progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the least developed countries has been uneven and is not on pace to achieve the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda. The number of people living in extreme poverty remained at approximately 32 per cent, and those suffering from hunger is on the rise, in particular among those in vulnerable situations. There is evidence of losses in jobs and incomes in least developed countries. Unemployment, in particular of young people, is rampant. The inequalities between least developed countries and the rest of the world, as well as among least developed countries, are rising. Infant and maternal mortality is exorbitantly high. Access to energy and broadband connectivity is moving at a slower pace. Structural transformation is not taking hold. Infrastructure investment and equitable access to infrastructure services are falling far behind actual needs. Productive capacity and export competitiveness are weak. Climate change is occurring much faster than anticipated, as evidenced by, inter alia, disproportionately high levels of economic losses, damage to critical infrastructure, disruption of basic services in the least developed countries, devastating impacts on oceans and seas, loss of vulnerable ecosystems, land degradation, the retreat of mountain glaciers and the continued rise in global temperatures, thereby threatening the lives of many people, in particular the poorest and people in vulnerable situations. Biodiversity loss, deforestation, water stress and global pollution from chemicals and waste remain major global challenges, while desertification, land degradation and coastal erosion continue to increase.",
    "14": " and diverse support for the least developed countries in forging the widest possible coalition of multi-stakeholder partnerships.",
    "15": "We reaffirm that the least developed countries, as the most vulnerable group of countries, need enhanced global support to overcome the structural challenges and recent devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that they face in implementing the 2030 Agenda, and call upon development partners, international organizations and other stakeholders to support least developed countries in its implementation. We also call upon in this regard the international community to prioritize and strengthen support from all sources to facilitate the coordinated implementation and coherent follow-up and monitoring of the Doha Programme of Action and the 2030 Agenda in the least developed countries.",
    "16": "We underscore that the ownership, leadership and primary responsibility for development in least developed countries rests with the least developed countries themselves. Least developed countries should identify their own national priorities and formulate and execute coherent economic and development policies and strategies. Development partners commit to providing concrete and substantial support to these efforts, in a spirit of shared responsibility and mutual accountability, through a renewed and strengthened global partnership.",
    "17": "The Doha Programme of Action will be guided by the principles of shared responsibility, ownership and leadership of the least developed countries; an integrated and comprehensive approach; resilience-building and risk reduction; genuine and reinvigorated partnerships; result orientation; peace, security, development and human rights; respect for cultural diversity, inclusion and equity; and voice and representation and a balanced role of State and market considerations as reflected in the Istanbul Programme of Action. The Doha Programme of Action represents the enhanced commitments of the least developed countries, which have the ownership of and primary responsibility for their own development, and their development partners to a renewed and strengthened global partnership.",
    "18": "This partnership also includes the United Nations system, including the Bretton Woods institutions, other multilateral institutions and regional development banks, within their relevant mandates and international obligations.",
    "19": "Guided by the spirit of solidarity with least developed countries, developing countries, consistent with their capabilities, will provide support for the effective implementation of the Doha Programme of Action in mutually agreed areas of cooperation within the framework of South-South and triangular cooperation, which is a complement to, but not a substitute for, North-South cooperation.",
    "20": "The private sector, civil society and foundations will be encouraged to contribute to the implementation of the Doha Programme of Action in their relevant areas of competence in line with the national priorities of least developed countries and in collaboration with relevant national government institutions.",
    "21": "We also underscore that good governance and the rule of law, inclusiveness and transparency, as well as domestic resource mobilization, are crucial to the development process of the least developed countries. These efforts need to be given concrete and substantial international support in a spirit of shared responsibility and mutual accountability through a renewed and strengthened global partnership.",
    "22": "",
    "23": "We recognize that investment in the care economy is needed to spur sustainable economies, restore and create jobs, recognize, reduce and redistribute women\u2019s disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, and close the gender gap in labour force participation.",
    "24": "The COVID-19 pandemic, the Ebola outbreaks, the financial crisis and climate change have demonstrated that we live in a highly globalized and interconnected world, where a crisis or a virus in a small part of a country can spread to the entire world in a short span of time and have devastating impacts globally. COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of holistic, all-hazard and One Health approaches that consider interdependencies among the health of humans, animals and plants and their shared environment. Looking beyond crises and bearing in mind the core principles of the 2030 Agenda, it is our shared responsibility to ensure that no one is left behind and to reach the furthest behind first.",
    "25": "We will undertake action to leverage the opportunities offered by the 226 million young people in least developed countries who are real agents of change for structural transformation, through productive capacity development in agricultural, manufacturing, cultural and creative industries and services sectors, including tourism; building and maintaining quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure to improve the movement of goods and services, promoting life-cycle approaches; expanding energy access and broadband connectivity; tapping into emerging technologies; mainstreaming technology-driven entrepreneurship and developing innovative digital ecosystems; delivering digital services and applications; harnessing the demographic dividend that will yield economic and health gains that come with ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education; and lifelong learning for all, including persons with disabilities, while combating all forms of discrimination.",
    "26": "We are committed to building stronger, multifaceted and resilient systems in the least developed countries. With the support of the international community, least developed countries need to design systems, including infrastructure in transportation and communications, energy and information and communications technology (ICT), supply chains, economic, financial, public health and food systems, and universal social protection, that are resilient, sustainable, comprehensive, shock-responsive, gender-sensitive and risk-informed. Such action has the potential to make the national economic system stronger and more resilient against any future shocks and ensure sustainable and irreversible graduation from the least developed country category and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.",
    "27": "We affirm that the integrated and indivisible nature of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030 requires the involvement of all relevant stakeholders at all levels \u2013 local, national and international \u2013 in solutions that are context-appropriate, respond to the needs and rights of populations, in particular those furthest behind, and tap into the full range of existing knowledge and experience. It is, in fact, encouraging that national and local governments, civil society, academia, the private sector and other relevant stakeholders have engaged with the Sustainable Development Goals and the objectives of the Paris Agreement and are developing innovative approaches and practices. International financial institutions and several central and national development banks have started to better reflect the Goals as a whole in their strategies and policies.",
    "28": " developed countries that contribute to closing their funding gaps in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals.",
    "29": "We reaffirm our commitment to a comprehensive, results-oriented, enhanced, quantifiable, forward-looking, coherent, renewed and strengthened global partnership for least developed countries based on the principles of leaving no one behind that is fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. We also reaffirm our commitments to supporting the least developed countries through, inter alia, fulfilling all internationally agreed goals and targets related to respective official development assistance (ODA) commitments, market access, debt relief, when appropriate, technology transfer on mutually agreed terms, technical assistance and capacity-building. These commitments must be met and action must be taken beyond existing commitments to bring about transformational change in least developed countries. The United Nations system, including its specialized agencies, including the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and other relevant institutions, to provide finance, technical support, assistance and policy advice to all priority areas for the least developed countries, and this support will be improved, including through additional concessional finance and the coordination between agencies and departments, using approaches such as the integrated national financing frameworks.",
    "30": "We affirm that Governments play a very important role in articulating and implementing the policies and programmes that will support a sustainable future that leaves no one behind. National parliaments will have a great role to play in enacting legislation and allocating funds that serve all in order to leave no one behind, as well as holding Governments to account for the commitments that they have made.",
    "31": "The Doha Programme of Action will have six key focus areas for action, as follows: (a) Investing in people in least developed countries: eradicating poverty and building capacity to leave no one behind; (b) Leveraging the power of science, technology, and innovation to fight against multidimensional vulnerabilities and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; (c) Supporting structural transformation as a driver of prosperity; (d) Enhancing international trade of least developed countries and regional integration; (e) Addressing climate change, environmental degradation, recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and building resilience against future shocks for risk-informed sustainable development; (f) Mobilizing international solidarity, reinvigorated global partnerships and innovative tools and instruments: a march towards sustainable graduation. I. Investing in people in least developed countries: eradicating poverty and building capacity to leave no one behind",
    "32": "We recognize that people, especially the large youth and working-age population in least developed countries, are critical assets for their development. It is estimated that, between 2020 and 2030, the population in the least developed countries will increase by 256 million, to 1.3 billion people.",
    "33": " nearly 30 per cent of the population in least developed countries would remain in extreme poverty by 2030. Upward trends in extreme poverty and gender inequality in least developed countries since the COVID-19 outbreak suggest compounding impacts of the crisis caused by the pandemic.",
    "34": "In addition to having a low income, people living in poverty in least developed countries experience higher mortality rates and food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, limited or no access to quality inclusive education and health-care services, and a lack of access to opportunities to gain income through decent employment. Poor people in the least developed countries live in underserved areas with poor infrastructure and limited access to water and sanitation and have limited access to social protection. We respect and value the diversity of situations and conditions of women and girls and recognize that some women face specific barriers to their empowerment. We also stress that, while all women and girls have the same human rights, women and girls in different contexts have specific needs and priorities, requiring appropriate responses.",
    "35": "We reaffirm our commitment to diversity in cities and human settlements, to strengthening social cohesion, intercultural dialogue and understanding, tolerance, mutual respect, gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, inclusion, and the identity, safety and dignity of all people, and to taking steps to ensure that local institutions promote pluralism and peaceful coexistence within increasingly heterogenous and multicultural societies.",
    "36": "We are guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including full respect for international law. We are further guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights treaties. We emphasize the importance of fundamental freedoms for all. We are also informed by other instruments such as the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and core international human rights instruments. We recognize that good governance at all levels, strong institutions, democracy, the rule of law, transparency and accountability, and affording individuals access to the health-care services and education, knowledge and skills needed for productive capacity and full participation in decision-making processes are crucial to achieving sustainable development. Least developed countries still face challenges in ensuring universal access to inclusive, equitable and quality education, social protection and essential health-care services, and their vulnerabilities and limited capacities exacerbate the impact of external shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural hazards and the adverse impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss.",
    "37": "We aim to eradicate poverty, including extreme poverty, hunger and malnutrition, in all its forms and dimensions, to advance human development in an inclusive and sustainable way for all in the least developed countries by the end of the decade and to provide equal opportunities for all, with special attention given to the poorest and most vulnerable, including women and girls in vulnerable situation, young people and children, older persons and persons with disabilities, as well as those affected by violence and conflict, in order to leave no one behind.

We commit to taking the following actions:",
    "39": "We will reinforce social protection policies and programmes that are risk- informed, take into account the specific needs of women and girls, age and persons with disabilities, and contribute to strengthening the ability of communities and people, in particular the poorest and most vulnerable, to withstand poverty and risks to their livelihoods and well-being, throughout their life course. We call upon Governments to extend social protection for all, including workers in the informal economy. We will also build social protection systems that are resilient and can respond to shocks, including by integrating disaster risk reduction into social protection strategies.",
    "40": "We recognize that significant additional domestic public resources, supplemented by international assistance, as appropriate, will be critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In this regard, we commit to providing fiscally sustainable and nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all. We commit to supporting predictable finance, including ODA, domestic resource mobilization, trade and private sector financing and tax and public transfer reforms, where appropriate.",
    "41": "We commit to increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector at the national, subnational and local levels in delivering inclusive social protection programmes, including by expanding the digital infrastructure and ICT capabilities of the public administration, by establishing national social registry systems, by enhancing and digitalizing cash transfers and payment of entitlements, and by increasing transparency and access to information.",
    "42": "We recognize the need for dealing with severe food insecurities. In this regard, we request the Secretary-General to explore the feasibility, effectiveness and administrative modalities of a system of stockholding for the least developed countries on a regional and subregional basis, or alternative means, such as cash transfers, taking into account possible economic implications and risks, and to report thereon to the General Assembly for its consideration at its seventy-seventh session. Achieving universal access to quality education, skills and lifelong learning",
    "43": "Notwithstanding progress in increasing enrolment rates for primary education, 16.2 per cent of children of primary school age were out of school in least developed countries in 2019 and almost half of children out of school in the world are in least developed countries, with girls, children with disabilities and other children in vulnerable situations disproportionately represented.",

    "46": "We commit to supporting least developed countries and providing financing to strengthen national inclusive and efficient education systems in order to harness the demographic dividend, for both remote and on-site classes, including through better curricula that respond to the dynamic nature of education, training and the job market; local contexts, including country-specific challenges and local cultural contents; teacher development, retention and deployment, especially in rural areas; and improvements in basic infrastructure and providing adequate supplies that suit the learning requirements of all children.",
    "47": "We also commit to supporting least developed countries in increasing enrolment and decreasing dropout rates through measures such as abolishing school fees, providing school feeding programmes that support healthy diets, water and sanitation facilities, vaccinations, various school health services and improving the quality of education and especially foundational learning.

    "49": "We further commit to supporting the least developed countries in gaining access to and effectively utilizing digital tools and technologies to improve education outcomes for all learners, including through educational radio and television programmes, to meet learning and educational requirements according to the local context. We also commit to distributing equipment and teaching materials, such as radios and textbooks, both in physical and digital formats, including to the poorest and vulnerable households, especially for girls. We further commit to supporting large-scale national efforts to utilize all forms of distance learning technology, including low-cost technology, in support of remote learning and online education, including through digital technologies, for better resilience in national equitable and efficient education systems, as well as training to develop the digital skills of students and educators.",
    "50": "We recognize the importance of education for sustainable development and global citizenship education in helping countries to achieve a sustainable and inclusive recovery after COVID-19, and will strengthen education for sustainable development and global citizenship education in the period 2021\u20132030.",
    "51": "We will encourage interaction, collaboration and exchange programmes of students and the sharing of scientific studies and research papers among academic institutions of least developed countries and the rest of the world. We commit to substantially expanding globally the number of scholarships for enrolment in higher education, including vocational training, and we will encourage higher education institutes to allocate places and scholarships for students and trainees from least developed countries, especially for young women, in particular in the fields of science, technology, engineering, medicine and business administration, in developed countries and other developing countries and encourage the full uptake of scholarships offered by higher education institutes to least developed countries.",

By 2030, one in five of the projected number of young people in the world will have been born in the least developed countries. In 2019, more than one in five young people around the world were not in employment, education or training, which is almost unchanged since 2005. Given that young women were already twice as likely to be unemployed and not in education or training as young men, and because women have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the COVID-19 crisis is likely to worsen not in employment, education or training gender gaps among young people. Targets \u2022 Ensure, by 2030, that all young people achieve literacy and numeracy. \u2022 Ensure access to lifelong digital learning opportunities for skills development. \u2022 Increase youth participation and inclusion in decision-making processes. \u2022 Increase access to safe and healthy working conditions, decent work opportunities, knowledge and skills for all young people in the least developed countries. \u2022 Promote entrepreneurial training to young people, including through financial and technical assistance.

In addition, they lack the capacity to mobilize the large amounts of financing required to invest in major power generation projects. Only some 53 per cent of the population in least developed countries has access to energy, with rates of access in rural areas of approximately only 10 per cent in some countries. We recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the importance of affordable, reliable sustainable and modern energy access, from health services to the use of ICT. Resources deployed for COVID-19 responses and immediate health priorities have further constrained already limited fiscal capacity and increased the risk of energy insecurity in these countries.",

In this regard, we commit to promoting regular public- private sector dialogue. IV. Enhancing international trade of least developed countries and regional integration",
    "157": "We recognize that least developed countries can derive significant benefit from a universal, rules-based, open, transparent, predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under WTO. Notwithstanding the massive expansion of trade and investment in the past decades, least developed countries face considerable challenges in effective integration into global trading systems and in benefiting from the opportunities afforded by international trade and global value chains.",
    "158": "We are concerned that the least developed countries\u2019 share of global merchandise exports stagnated over the past decade, remaining at 1 per cent.

The crisis has also highlighted the fundamental importance of trade in making essential goods and services available to countries and people in need.",
    "160": "We acknowledge that the share of total global exports of cultural goods from least developed countries accounted for only a 0.5 per cent share of total global exports, both in 2005 and 2014. The potential of the cultural and creative sector to enhance least developed countries\u2019 participation in and benefit from new opportunities for dynamic growth in world trade remains largely untapped.",
    "161": "We are concerned that rising protectionist tendencies are threatening to further weaken efforts regarding the expansion of international trade and emphasize that bilateral and regional trade agreements should complement but not substitute the role of WTO as the central governing body for global trade. Otherwise, the international trade landscape could become increasingly polarized and fragmented in the coming decades, which would be harmful for the least developed countries.",
    "162": "We call upon WTO members to fully and expeditiously implement all the decisions of its Ministerial Conferences taken in favour of least developed countries. Key action areas Duty-free and quota-free market access",
    "163": "We note that there have been progressive improvements since the adoption of the Istanbul Programme of Action on providing duty-free and quota-free market access to least developed countries. WTO members adopted a duty-free and quota- free market access decision at the Ninth Ministerial Conference, held in Bali, Indonesia, in 2013. Most of the developed country members grant either full or nearly full duty-free and quota-free market access, with gaps remaining in a limited number of markets and a few sectors. A number of developing country members have granted a significant degree of duty-free and quota-free market access to products from least developed countries and a number of them have reached nearly full duty-free and quota-free coverage. Least developed countries need to be provided with increasingly greater market access in preference-granting countries. Targets \u2022 Facilitate market access for products of least developed countries, including by developing simple and transparent rules of origin applicable to imports from least developed countries, in accordance with the guidelines adopted by WTO members at the Ministerial Conference held in Bali in 2013. \u2022 Significantly increase the exports of least developed countries, in particular with a view to doubling4 their share of global exports by 2031. We commit to taking the following actions:",

    "165": "We reiterate our conviction that no country graduating from the least developed country category should have its development progress disrupted or reversed. We welcome that the United Nations graduation process helps to ensure that no graduating country has its special and differential treatment measures and exemptions abruptly reduced. We invite development and trading partners to consider extending to the graduated country trade preferences previously made available as a result of least developed country status or reducing them in a phased manner in order to avoid their abrupt reduction. We note that the Group of Least Developed Countries put forward various proposals at WTO, pertaining to, among other things, trade-related challenges and those related to the smooth transition of the countries graduating from the least developed country category, and seek to further examine these issues.",
    "166": "We commit to fully meeting our transparency obligations on trade measures and meaningfully improving equitable access for all countries, especially least developed countries, to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, including through facilitating technology transfer within the framework of multilateral rules and applicable international obligations, so as to encourage research and innovation while at the same time supporting licensing agreements and any other arrangements on mutually agreed terms in the short and medium term, as well as any other long-term arrangements that help to scale up the manufacturing of vaccines and in a sustainable manner. Preferential rules of origin",
    "167": "We note that considerable progress has been made towards ensuring that preferential rules of origin are simple and transparent and contribute to facilitating market access of imports from least developed countries. WTO members adopted two decisions on preferential rules of origin for least developed countries, at the Ministerial Conferences held in Bali in 2013 and in Nairobi in 2015. Almost all preference-granting members have submitted notifications of their preferential rules of origin requirements. Target \u2022 Ensure that preferential rules of origin applicable to imports from least developed countries are transparent and simple and contribute to facilitating market access. We commit to taking the following actions:",

We call upon preference-granting members that have not yet done so, to notify their least developed country-specific preferential rules of origin to enhance transparency.",
    "169": " Least developed countries services waiver",
    "170": "We recognize that the agreements on trade in services enable the liberalization of services across all modes of supply and help to boost trade in services and attract investment, as well as enable safe, regular and orderly mobility, including by removing barriers to the temporary movement of natural persons to supply services abroad, or \u201cmode 4\u201d of trade in services. We note that efforts are being made to improve the participation of least developed countries in services trade. We note that 51 members (including individual European Union member States) have notified their preferences under the least developed countries services waiver. We note that multilateral commitments in this regard have been limited and conditioned by measures such as economic needs tests, quotas or pre-employment requirements. Target \u2022 Increase least developed countries\u2019 exports of services by fully implementing the WTO ministerial decision on the operationalization of the waiver concerning preferential treatment to services and service suppliers of least developed countries and encourage members that have not yet notified their preferences under the least developed countries services waiver, to also do the same. We commit to taking the following actions:",
    "171": "We call upon the WTO members to take concrete measures, including meaningful preferences for least developed countries services and service suppliers, in accordance with the WTO ministerial decisions in 2011, 2013 and 2015 on the operationalization of the least developed countries services waiver and in response to the collective request of those countries. We also call for strengthening domestic service capacity in least developed countries through enhanced technical assistance and capacity-building. Technical assistance and capacity-building, including through Aid for Trade",
    "172": "We note that, between 2011 and 2019, more than $100 billion was disbursed in Aid for Trade to support least developed countries in strengthening infrastructure, building productive capacity and enhancing trade policy and regulations. After reaching a peak of $20 billion in 2018, Aid for Trade commitments to least developed countries fell by 19 per cent, to $16.6 billion in 2019. Although Aid for Trade funding to least developed countries has grown 13 per cent annually since 2006, reaching $13.5 billion in 2018, the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to slow or reverse this trend. Target \u2022 Significantly increase Aid for Trade support for least developed countries, which is expected to double by 2031 from 2018 levels. 5 We commit to taking the following actions:",
    "173": "We aim to increase the proportion of total Aid for Trade going to least developed countries, provided according to development cooperation effectiveness principles, which is expected to double by 2031 from 2018 levels. We also call for increased support from multilateral development banks and the private sector to meet trade financing needs. We urge private and public sector actors to work together to address trade finance gaps, by enabling a rapid transition to paperless trading and addressing regulatory constraints that hinder trade finance.",
    "174": "We, in acknowledging and building on achievements made to date, including by the Enhanced Integrated Framework and others providing support to least developed countries, commit to providing trade-related assistance and financial and technical support to enhance the institutional and productive capacity of the least developed countries, in line with the objective of the 2030 Agenda to leave no one behind.",
    "175": "We note that 35 of 46 least developed countries, or more than three quarter, are WTO members. Since 2011, six least developed countries have successfully completed the accession process and joined WTO. Currently, eight least developed countries are at different stages of the accession process. Target \u2022 Ensure accession to WTO of all least developed countries committed to do so by the end of the current decade. We commit to taking the following actions:",

We welcome that, pursuant to the decision on the implementation of article 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement, developed country members have provided annual reports on incentives and planned action under article 66.2. We also welcome that, in 2021, the duration of the general transition period under article 66.1 has been further extended until 1 July 2034. Similarly, in 2015, the specific transition to implement or apply sections 5 (patents) and 7 (protection of undisclosed information) of part II of the TRIPS Agreement with respect to pharmaceutical products was extended until 1 January 2033 for least developed countries.

We also commit to working together within WTO, including through the ongoing quadrennial reviews of the Agreement, to support implementation through coordination, the sharing of experiences and transparency. E-commerce",
    "186": "We note that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of digital technologies as tools for continuing economic activity during the crisis. E-commerce can take the form of business-to-business or business-to-consumer transactions, combined with secure online mobile platforms and fintech solutions fundamentally, and can profoundly reduce the matching costs by which buyers and suppliers can meet, connect and create profits within the country and across borders and facilitate access to last-mile producers and markets. This can speed up economic adjustments to shocks such as COVID-19 and many other profound economic, environmental and geopolitical shocks that a country may face in the coming years. The huge potential notwithstanding, least developed countries have been unable to sufficiently benefit from the opportunities offered by e-commerce owing to a lack of necessary digital infrastructure, logistical facilities, digital literacy and skills, and fintech solutions, as well as regulatory and policy frameworks.

Regional integration",
    "190": "We underline that regional cooperation, including trade integration and transit cooperation, can facilitate the integration of least developed countries into the global trading system. We note that, as at 1 February 2021, 339 regional trade agreements were in force, of which 42 are in Africa. Among others, the African Continental Free Trade Area and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership present a major opportunity for participating least developed countries to boost trade, output in services, and the manufacturing and natural resources sectors. Positive experiences notwithstanding, regional and international cooperation still needs to rise to the challenges ahead. We commit to taking the following actions:",

    "199": "The COVID-19 pandemic has not only exposed, but also amplified least developed countries\u2019 high degree of vulnerability and the risks of cascading crises. We are concerned that a prolonged economic downturn following the pandemic risks adversely affecting the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the 2030 Agenda and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, as well as the ability of countries, especially least developed countries, to adequately respond to the adverse impacts of climate change and environmental degradation.",
    "200": "We are deeply concerned that the limited fiscal space and resilience capacity in least developed countries pose serious constraints on their ability to address the COVID-19 pandemic and foster sustainable recovery. The investment in climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in least developed countries has fallen considerably short of meeting needs. We are also concerned that climate change impacts are becoming more acute. Food insecurity and malnutrition, water stress, quality and scarcity, land degradation, biodiversity loss, melting of glaciers, ocean acidification, coastal erosion, sea level rise, damage to infrastructure and assets, pressures on pastures, displacement of populations, threats to cultural heritage, disruption of indigenous and traditional lifestyles, and threats to livelihoods are severely disrupting economic and social development. Changes in the access to and availability of water resources are disrupting hydroelectric generation and putting industrial production and basic services at increased risk, while sanitation and wastewater management remain a source of concern. We urge least developed countries, and will support them through strengthening partnerships, global coordination and cooperation, to adopt an all-hazard, multisectoral and coordinated approach in preparedness for health emergencies, recognizing the links between human, plant and animal health and their shared environment and the need for a One Health approach.",
    "201": "We are committed to reducing the vulnerability of the least developed countries to economic, environmental shocks and natural hazards, especially those related to climate change, and to enhancing their ability to meet these and other challenges through enhanced adaptive capacity and resilience.

    "211": "While least developed countries have made some progress in the process to formulate and implement national adaptation plans and in implementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, they often lack the resources and capacity to address critical needs. Adaptation and resilience in food systems, including in the sectors of agriculture, manufacturing, social protection services and livestock, are of prime importance for least developed countries and have major implications for food security, nutrition, livelihoods, especially of the most vulnerable in society, and employment. Water resources already face multiple pressures and are highly sensitive to climate change impacts such as the drying-up of sources, disruption in rainfall patterns and increased frequency of both extreme and slow-onset events, which reinforce already existing trends in land degradation and desertification. The rapid projected growth of urban populations presents challenges in the provision of services such as water and sanitation, which must develop and grow at a faster rate in order to keep pace. Localization of climate action, including support for local governments and building resilient communities, is extremely important because they understand local needs and are on the front line of climate change adaptation action, and disaster risk reduction, response and recovery. Critical infrastructure services, such as transport, water and electricity, remain highly unreliable and vulnerable to extreme climatic events.

Available resources \u2013 domestic, external, public and private \u2013 have not been sufficient to meet growing investment and spending needs. The high reliance of least developed countries on external resources, including ODA, FDI, concessional lending and private flows, such as remittances and portfolio investment, persisted over the past decade. During the Istanbul Programme of Action implementation period, external debt has been rising and is, in some cases, exacerbated by large costs caused by disasters and structural vulnerabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout have exacerbated financial vulnerabilities and debt risks in least developed countries, which have been building up over the past decade.",

However, most graduating least developed countries face a multitude of challenges, including poverty and inequalities, in particular gender inequality, inadequate structural transformation and productive capacity, and vulnerability to economic and climatic shocks. Furthermore, we are concerned by the simultaneous loss of least developed country-specific support measures compounded by the negative social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.",

This includes the need for improved planning and coordination of transition finance by ODA providers during both the preparatory period and the post-graduation phase.",

We welcome that the United Nations graduation process helps to ensure that no graduating country has its special and differential treatment measures and exemptions reduced abruptly. We invite development and trading partners to consider extending to the graduated country trade preferences previously made available as a result of least developed country status or reducing them in a phased manner in order to avoid their abrupt reduction. We note that the Group of Least Developed Countries put forward various proposals at WTO, pertaining to, among other things, trade-related challenges and those related to the smooth transition of the countries graduating from the least developed country category, and seek to further examine these issues.

The average statistical capacity indicator score increased from 56.4 in 2011 to 58.0 in 2019 but remains below the world average of 64.
