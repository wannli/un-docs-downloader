    "2": "We recall and reaffirm our commitments to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,2 recognizing its integrated and indivisible nature and acknowledging that the 2030 Agenda includes commitments that relate to combating all forms of trafficking in persons, recognize the importance of partnerships in this regard, and emphasize that the 2030 Agenda and the Global Plan of Action are mutually reinforcing.",
    "3": "We reaffirm the crucial importance of universal ratification of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 3 and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,4 taking into consideration the central role of those instruments in the fight against trafficking in persons, and urge Member States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to the Convention and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, as a matter of priority. We urge States parties to those instruments to implement them fully and effectively, and welcome the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime to establish a mechanism for the review of the implementation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto.",
    "4": "We also reaffirm our recognition that \u201ctrafficking in persons\u201d means the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation, which includes, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs, as set forth in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.",
    "5": "We reiterate that trafficking in persons is a serious crime and a grave offence to human dignity and physical integrity, a violation and abuse of human rights and a challenge to sustainable development and we note that respect for human rights is an important basis of comprehensive anti-trafficking strategies.",
    "6": "We reaffirm the importance of universal ratification and implementation of other relevant international instruments that address trafficking in persons, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child 5 and its optional protocols relevant to trafficking in persons.6",
    "7": "We recall the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration 7 and the Global Compact on Refugees,8 and take note of Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women general recommendation No. 38 (2020) on trafficking in women and girls in the context of global migration. 9",
    "8": "We reiterate our commitment to prevent trafficking in persons, including through targeted education and awareness-raising campaigns. We welcome the designation of 30 July as the World Day against Trafficking in Persons. 10 We commit to fulfil our obligations and intensify our efforts to prevent and address, with a view to eliminating, the demand that fosters trafficking in persons, especially of women and girls, for all forms of exploitation, and in this regard to put in place or enhance preventive measures, including legislative and punitive measures to deter exploiters, and those who facilitate or profit from the exploitation of trafficking victims, and hold them accountable.",
    "9": "We reaffirm our commitment to address the social, economic, cultural, political and other factors that make people vulnerable to trafficking in persons, such as poverty, underdevelopment, irregular migration, statelessness, unemployment, inequality, gender inequality, sexual and gender-based violence, discrimination, including gender and racial discrimination, disability, social and financial exclusion, marginalization, stigmatization, corruption, persecution as well as humanitarian emergencies, armed conflicts and natural disasters. We also reaffirm the crucial importance of addressing negative social norms that sustain gender inequality and discrimination, including the culture of tolerance towards violence against women, youth and children, that make them particularly vulnerable to trafficking in persons. We commit to take strong efforts to include more women in leadership positions and all decision-making processes.",
    "10": "We express our serious concern over the significant and enduring trafficking of women and children, recognize that trafficking in persons disproportionately affects them, and call upon Member States to enact or update national laws and establish comprehensive policies, programmes and other measures that provide for the protection of trafficked women and children from revictimization and appropriate assistance and protection in the best interests of the child. We stress the importance of coordinating both national and international cooperation to enhance the positive effects of all anti-trafficking efforts.",
    "11": "We express grave concern that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated existing situations of vulnerability to trafficking in persons, including in digital contexts, increasing the number of individuals at risk, exposing victims to bigger challenges due to either abandonment or increased confinement by traffickers, reduced access to assistance, and the restricted or complete lack of ability to either work or return home, making their living conditions unbearable. We recognize the need to place increased priority and urgency on prevention, planning and coordination, both national and international, to mitigate the impact of emerging and ongoing challenges on trafficking responses and that more global efforts are needed to combat discrimination against people vulnerable to trafficking in persons, particularly migrants, who are more vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking with the outbreak of the pandemic. We note with concern that sexual and gender-based violence increased globally during the pandemic, and commit to intensifying efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in public and private spheres, including trafficking in persons for sexual exploitation and abuse and forced labour.",
    "12": "",
    "13": "We commit to undertake appropriate measures to facilitate access to justice and protections for victims of trafficking in persons that should not be conditional on their participation in criminal proceedings, taking into account national legislation. We will seek to ensure that laws and policies are in place to alleviate reliance on victims\u2019 testimonies, including the use of digital evidence, financial records or other evidence, as appropriate. Where the victim\u2019s testimony is necessary, we will ensure that protections are in place for the victims, having regard to their specific vulnerabilities. We also commit to take steps to ensure that effective remedies, including for damage suffered, are available. We also commit to intensify our efforts, subject to our national laws, rules and regulations, to implement the principle of non-punishment of victims of trafficking, which should apply to unlawful activity that a victim of trafficking in persons has been compelled to be involved in as a direct consequence of their trafficking situation and for all types of punishment, including criminal, civil, administrative and immigration offences. We commit to provide appropriate responses to trafficking in persons situations, including through proactive and fair identification procedures, and access to effective remedies for victims who have been unjustly penalized for illegal acts committed in connection with their victimization.",
    "14": "We affirm our commitment to protect the privacy and identity and ensure the safety of victims of trafficking in persons before, during and after criminal proceedings and to protect immediate family members and witnesses, as appropriate, from retaliation by traffickers by ensuring their safety in accordance with articles 24 and 25 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.",
    "15": "We reaffirm our commitment to continue our efforts to criminalize trafficking in persons in all its forms, and to strengthen cooperation and coordination among Member States in countries of origin, transit and destination in order to disrupt and dismantle criminal networks involved in such crimes, including through, inter alia, the enhancement of information-sharing with full respect for domestic law and mutual legal assistance and extradition in combating crimes that might be connected with trafficking in persons, such as money-laundering, corruption, illicit financial flows, the smuggling of migrants, the trafficking in illicit drugs, and all forms of organized crime. We commit to enhancing the capacity of law enforcement and criminal justice systems to identify, investigate and prosecute cases of trafficking in persons, and analyse financial flows to detect those criminal networks in collaboration with financial institutions. We also commit to developing and strengthening national referral mechanisms and to use available technology to sustain victim referrals and services and to identify, seize and forfeit ill-gotten gains of those criminal networks. We further commit to strengthening the capacity of criminal justice practitioners, including law enforcement officials, prosecutors, judges and correction and probation officers, and to enable a victim-centred, age- and gender-sensitive approach to care and assistance of victims, that takes into consideration disability and trauma and that addresses the specific needs of women, youth and children.",

    "18": "We also reiterate the need to continue to enhance the overall organization and coherence in the global efforts of the United Nations system to respond to trafficking in persons, especially in ensuring support to Member States. In this regard, while recalling that the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons was established to foster coordination and cooperation among relevant United Nations system entities and other international organizations involved in combating trafficking in persons, with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime as its coordinator, we urge the Secretary-General to continue efforts to strengthen coordination within the United Nations system and to inform Member States thereof through existing reporting channels.",
    "19": "We recognize the important role played by the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons in the United Nations system, and recognize with appreciation the ongoing efforts of its member entities to respond to trafficking in persons. We invite the Coordination Group to continue to increase its activities related to the implementation of the Global Plan of Action and, to that end, to incorporate aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development relevant to preventing and combating trafficking in persons and to continue to advance the coordination of future activities and avoidance of duplication of efforts.

    "22": "We reiterate the need for improved data collection and analysis of trafficking in persons, disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant factors, including the form of exploitation, and using systematic and consistent criteria, to effectively counter trafficking in persons. We thus recognize the importance of improved data collection by national authorities and will enhance international cooperation to this end, including through capacity-building, financial support and technical assistance. We will do so consistent with our national legislation on data protection, if applicable, and our respective international obligations related to privacy.",
    "23": "We acknowledge the importance of the biennial Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, prepared by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime pursuant to the Global Plan of Action, and request the Office to continue to collect information on patterns, forms and flows of trafficking in persons, at the national, regional and international levels, in a balanced, reliable and comprehensive manner, to be published in the Global Report, and in ongoing research to estimate the prevalence of trafficking in persons, in close cooperation and collaboration with Member States.",

We also emphasize the importance of countering such misuse while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with our obligations under international law. In this regard: (a) We call for the strengthening of law enforcement digital expertise and capacity to conduct proportionate, lawful, accountable and necessary investigations in cyberspace, including the dark web, and seize associated electronic evidence. We encourage the appropriate use by law enforcement of technology-based solutions that address the global scope of trafficking in persons; (b) We further encourage the appropriate use of technology and innovative tools by practitioners and central authorities to increase international and cross-border cooperation in criminal matters.

In this regard, we recall the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 12 We also emphasize the need to establish firewalls between immigration checks and labour inspections, and/or to ensure that labour inspections are conducted in such a way that does not put potential victims of trafficking in fear of immigration authorities or offences. We stress the importance in implementing labour standards improving government procurement practices in efforts to promote decent work and the need to develop awareness-raising and educational programmes in partnership with civil society and the media to counter any acceptance of the use of forced labour and exploitation in the production of goods. We also urge the Secretary-General to ensure that all United Nations procurement does not contain goods and services produced by trafficked persons.",
    "29": "We acknowledge that the gaps between the Global Plan of Action and its implementation by Member States should be closed, and recognize that arrangements are needed to ensure the systematic follow-up to and review of all of the commitments we are making at the present high-level meeting, including in the quadrennial high- level meetings of the General Assembly to appraise progress achieved in the implementation of the Global Plan of Action.
