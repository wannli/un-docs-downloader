  "paragraphs": {
    "1": "We, the States Members of the United Nations, welcome the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons,1 reaffirm our commitments made therein, as well as in the previously adopted Political Declarations of 20172 and 2021,3 and evince our strong political will to take decisive concerted action to end this heinous crime, wherever it may occur.",
    "2": "We recall and reaffirm our commitments to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,4 recognizing its integrated and indivisible nature and acknowledging that the 2030 Agenda includes commitments that relate to combating all forms of trafficking in persons, recognize the importance of partnerships and international cooperation in this regard, and emphasize that the 2030 Agenda and the Global Plan of Action are mutually reinforcing.",
    "3": "We also welcome the actions and efforts related to ending trafficking in persons, especially of women and children, contained in resolution 79/1 entitled \u201cThe Pact for the Future\u201d.",
    "4": "We reaffirm the crucial importance of universal ratification of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 5 and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,6 taking into consideration the central role of those instruments in the fight against trafficking in persons, and urge Member States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to the Convention and the Protocol as a matter of priority. We urge States Parties to those instruments to implement them effectively, including through the Mechanism for the Review of the Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto.",
    "5": "We also reaffirm the importance of universal ratification and implementation of other relevant international instruments that address trafficking in persons, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child 7 and its optional protocols relevant to trafficking in persons.8",
    "6": "We recall the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, 9 the Global Compact on Refugees,10 and take note of Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women general recommendation No. 38 (2020) on trafficking in women and girls in the context of global migration.11",

    "8": "We reiterate our strong condemnation of trafficking in persons, which constitutes a serious crime and a grave offence to human dignity and physical integrity, a violation and abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms and a challenge to sustainable development, and we note that respect for human rights is an important basis of comprehensive anti\u2011trafficking strategies. Combating trafficking in persons requires the implementation of a comprehensive approach that includes partnerships, international cooperation and measures to prevent trafficking, to identify and protect the victims, as well as a criminal justice response, including the investigation, prosecution and punishment of traffickers. In this regard, we encourage the development of policies, programmes and national strategies to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, we underline the importance of cooperation with civil society and we note the need to strengthen legal and institutional frameworks for more effective responses.",
    "9": "We commit to fulfil our obligations and intensify our efforts to prevent, address and eliminate the demand that fosters trafficking in persons, especially of women and children, for all forms of exploitation, and in this regard to put in place or enhance preventive measures, including legislative and other measures to deter exploiters, and those who facilitate or profit from the exploitation of trafficking victims, and hold them accountable.",
    "10": "We reaffirm our commitment to address the social, economic, cultural, political and other factors that make people vulnerable to trafficking in persons, such as poverty, underdevelopment, unemployment, inequality, humanitarian emergencies, armed conflicts and natural disasters, sexual violence, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, social and financial exclusion and marginalization, as well as negative social norms, and a culture of tolerance towards violence against women, youth and children. We reiterate our commitment to promote education and awareness-raising campaigns to prevent trafficking in persons, and we welcome the designation of 30 July as the World Day against Trafficking in Persons.12",

We note with concern potential cases of trafficking in women for the exploitation of surrogacy. We express grave concern about the increase in child trafficking, primarily for forced labour, forced marriage, sexual exploitation, and involvement in criminal activities. We note the specific vulnerabilities of children, including children and youth with disabilities and unaccompanied children, to various forms of exploitation, including in the context of travel, tourism and sports, and the need to address them, as well as the cultural practices that justify or tolerate their demand. We call upon Member States to enact or update national laws and establish comprehensive policies, programmes and other measures, as appropriate, that provide for the protection of trafficked women and children from revictimization and appropriate assistance and protection in the best interests of the child.",
    "12": "We express solidarity with and compassion for victims and survivors, we call for full respect of their human rights and recognizing their role as agents of change in the global fight against trafficking in persons. We acknowledge the need to actively involve them, incorporating their perspective and experience in all efforts to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, including in designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating such efforts. We will provide victim-centred and trauma-informed care, assistance and services for their recovery and rehabilitation, access to health, including sexual and reproductive health-care services and mental health and psychosocial support services, and seek to enhance the provision of safe shelter, legal aid, long-term support, reintegration and timely family reunification, including protection and assistance, working also with civil society and other relevant partners. We will ensure that victims are treated with respect and dignity and are not inappropriately penalized or adversely affected by any actions taken by government authorities and communities, including criminal, civil, administrative and immigration penalties, for acts that they commit as a direct consequence of their trafficking situation, through the implementation of both the principle of non\u2011prosecution and non\u2011punishment of victims of trafficking subject to national laws, rules and regulations.",
    "13": "We commit to undertake appropriate measures to facilitate access to justice and protections for victims of trafficking in persons that should not be conditional on their participation in criminal proceedings, taking into account national legislation, and we will seek to ensure that laws and policies are in place to alleviate reliance on victims\u2019 testimonies. We also commit to take steps to ensure that effective remedies are available, including for damage suffered, as well as for victims who have been unjustly penalized for illegal acts committed in connection with their victimization. We further commit to enable a victim-centred, age- and gender-sensitive approach to care and assistance of victims that takes into consideration disability and trauma and that addresses the specific needs of women, youth and children.",
    "14": "We affirm our commitment to protect the privacy and identity and ensure the safety of victims of trafficking in persons before, during and after criminal proceedings, including when the victim\u2019s testimony is necessary in legal proceedings, and to protect immediate family members and witnesses, as appropriate, from retaliation by traffickers, by ensuring their safety, in accordance with articles 24 and 25 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, as applicable.",
    "15": "We reaffirm our commitment to continue our efforts to criminalize trafficking in persons in all its forms, to hold traffickers accountable for their crimes through prosecutions, and to strengthen cooperation and coordination among Member States in countries of origin, transit and destination in order to disrupt and dismantle criminal networks involved in such crimes, inter alia through the enhancement of information- sharing, including through the secure communications channels of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), where appropriate, as well as through mutual legal assistance and extradition, with full respect for domestic law, in combating crimes that might be connected with trafficking in persons, such as money- laundering, corruption, illicit financial flows, the smuggling of migrants, the trafficking in illicit drugs, illicit arms trafficking, cybercrime and all forms of organized crime and related illicit finance.",

We also commit to developing and strengthening national referral mechanisms and to use available technology to increase victim referrals and services and to identify, seize and forfeit proceeds of crime of those criminal networks. We emphasize the importance of regular and specialized professional training for officials and practitioners who are involved in preventing, identifying and responding to trafficking in persons, as a key component of an effective and victim-centred approach.",
    "17": "We also commit to investigate and prosecute trafficking in persons, and to take all appropriate measures to collect, preserve and store evidence of human trafficking, including when committed for the purpose of, particularly, sexual exploitation. We recognize that trafficking-related crimes often encompass other criminal acts and call for the adoption of prosecutorial policies that ensure accountability for the full range of harm suffered by victims.",

    "26": "We underline that the issue of trafficking in persons in situations of armed conflict, natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies requires further attention, while fully respecting the principles of humanitarian assistance. In this regard: (a) We recognize that refugees and migrants in large movements face greater risk of trafficking in persons, thus we will work to prevent trafficking among those affected by displacement, and provide support with targeted measures to identify victims or those at risk of trafficking in places of first arrival as well as throughout their journey, through the development of age- and gender-responsive policies and programmes. We also commit to intensify our efforts to prevent irregular migration and create and strengthen pathways for safe, orderly and regular migration to reduce the exposure of people on the move to trafficking in persons, recalling our respective commitments to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration; (b) We encourage the training of humanitarian and peacekeeping personnel to be deployed in humanitarian emergencies and peacekeeping operations on responding to trafficking in persons, child protection and sexual exploitation and abuse, and encourage relevant entities and bodies of the United Nations system to train their personnel, build their technical capacity to assess situations and respond to instances of trafficking in persons in these contexts.",

We also emphasize the importance of countering such misuse while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with our obligations under international law. In this regard: (a) We take note of the adoption of the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime; Strengthening International Cooperation for Combating Certain Crimes Committed by Means of Information and Communications Technology Systems and for the Sharing of Evidence in Electronic Form of Serious Crimes;14 (b) We call for the strengthening of law enforcement digital expertise and capacity to conduct proportionate, lawful, accountable and necessary investigations in cyberspace, including the dark web, and seize associated electronic evidence.

    "29": "We reaffirm that the crime of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal constitutes a form of exploitation and an offence against the human dignity of the victims that needs a multidisciplinary approach, based on respect for all human rights. We condemn the involvement of criminal groups and unethical medical personnel in trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal, and we call for better coordination and collaboration between criminal justice actors and medical professionals. We commit to adopting ethical and transparent regulations governing organ donations, strengthening legislative frameworks, including the criminalization of these practices and provisions to ensure the accountability of the perpetrators, and to resourcing such efforts.",
    "30": "We also reaffirm the importance of preventing and combating trafficking in persons in supply chains, including by deterring and penalizing fraudulent and abusive recruitment practices. We encourage Member States, multilateral organizations and the private sector to adopt ethical and transparent practices in their procurement and supply chains, and strongly urge them to regularly disclose and provide relevant information. We are mindful of the need to ensure that all actors in global supply chains, including intermediaries, who profit from the labour of trafficking victims are to be held accountable, including through sufficiently stringent sanctions and appropriate policy and legislation. In this regard, we recall the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.15 We stress the need to establish firewalls between immigration checks and labour inspections, to implement labour standards and to improve government procurement practices to promote decent work.

We will also promote the development of clearer analysis of successful counter-trafficking responses, and assessment and evaluation frameworks that include consideration of how laws, policies or practical measures affect victims of trafficking in persons."
