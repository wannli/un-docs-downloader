  "paragraphs": {
    "1": "Reaffirms its commitment to international cooperation and solidarity at all levels and as the only way for the world to effectively respond to global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and their consequences, and acknowledges the key leadership role of the World Health Organization and the fundamental role of the United Nations system in catalysing and coordinating the comprehensive global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the central efforts of Member States therein;",
    "2": "Emphasizes the contribution of sustainable, low-emission and energy- efficient modes of transport to climate change mitigation and adaptation and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the importance of long-term strategies and multi-stakeholder partnerships in delivering such sustainable modes of transport;",
    "3": "Takes into account the important role of transport for sustainable development as well as restoring normal living conditions and unhindered mobility, including ensuring the swift delivery of medical supplies, especially essential diagnostics and treatments, medicines and vaccines, therapeutics, and other health technologies during and after the COVID-19 pandemic;",
    "4": "Commits to enhancing the role of sustainable transport and mobility in job creation, mobility facilitation and improvement of the efficiency of logistics chains in connecting people and communities, particularly people in vulnerable situations, to jobs, schools and health services and in the delivery of goods and services to rural and urban communities, thus providing all with equal opportunities and leaving no one behind;",
    "5": "Calls upon Member States to maintain the continued functioning and strengthening of the transport system and transport infrastructure in all relevant aspects necessary for sustainable development, recognizing in this regard the importance of an enabling domestic environment and adequate domestic financing for the transport sector that does not undermine a country\u2019s debt sustainability in order to ensure stable and reliable domestic and international transport;",
    "6": "Calls for efforts to promote regional and interregional economic integration and cooperation, including by improving the planning of transportation infrastructure and mobility;",
    "7": "Invites Member States, as appropriate, to consider the experience achieved by the international community in dealing with the consequences of disasters through enhancing the effective implementation of relevant international conventions and multilateral instruments on transport and transit with the aim of ensuring stable, safe, reliable, accessible and sustainable transport during and after the COVID-19 pandemic;",
    "8": "Underlines the importance of international cooperation between relevant modes of transport and transport-related industries to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including by exchanging information, scientific knowledge and best practices, as well as sharing experiences from the implementation of national transport development programmes and strategies as appropriate;",

    "11": "Suggests that, with the further development of quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure and multimodal transport corridors, the use of electronic unified transport documents based on the digital transmission of relevant data could be considered for their potential, as they could minimize human involvement in transport and border crossing processes and thus could enhance the resilience of transport and logistics chains;",
    "12": "Emphasizes the importance of having reliable and sustainable channels for mutual exchange of information about the impact on transport operations and the movement of people by all modes of transport in situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic;",
    "13": "Calls for the promotion of the resilience of passenger transport to any outbreaks and other public health threats to contain the spread of infectious diseases in all modes of transport and in transport infrastructure facilities;",
