    "2": "Further reaffirm the 2016 political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on antimicrobial resistance, as reflected in its resolution 71/3 of 5 October 2016, the 2016 political declaration on HIV and AIDS, adopted in its resolution 70/266 of 8 June 2016, the 2014 outcome document of the high-level meeting of the Assembly on the comprehensive review and assessment of the progress achieved in the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, adopted in its resolution 68/300 of 10 July 2014, and its resolution 72/139 of 12 December 2017, in which the Assembly decided to hold a high-level meeting on universal health coverage in 2019, and take note of World Health Assembly resolution 69.2 of 28 May 2016, entitled \u201cCommitting to implementation of the Global Strategy for Women\u2019s, Children\u2019s and Adolescents\u2019 Health\u201d,3 and Human Rights Council resolution 33/11 of 29 September 2016 on preventable mortality and morbidity of children under 5 years of age as a human rights concern,4 and further reaffirm the World Health Organization End TB Strategy, as approved in World Health Assembly resolution 67.1 of 21 May 2014,5 and its associated targets;",
    "3": "Acknowledge that the Millennium Development Goals 6 and associated strategies, plans and programmes for the prevention and care of tuberculosis helped to reverse the trend of the tuberculosis epidemic and, between 2000 and 2016, reduced tuberculosis mortality by 37 per cent, which saved 53 million lives, and that investment in care and the prevention of tuberculosis brings some of the largest gains in terms of lives saved and economic benefits from development investments;",
    "4": "Welcome the convening of the first World Health Organization Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Tuberculosis in the Sustainable Development Era: A Multisectoral Response, held in Moscow on 16 and 17 November 2017, and take note with appreciation of its Moscow Declaration to End TB, with its commitments and calls for urgent action, notably on advancing the response to tuberculosis within the 2030 Agenda, ensuring sufficient and sustainable financing, pursuing science, research and innovation and developing a multisectoral accountability framework, which contributed to this meeting;",
    "5": "Recognize other recent high-level commitments and calls for action against tuberculosis, including its multidrug-resistant and zoonotic forms, made by global, regional and subregional bodies and meetings, including the Delhi End TB Summit, held from 12 to 17 March 2018;",
    "6": "Recognize that, while the World Health Organization declared tuberculosis a global emergency 25 years ago, it is still among the top 10 causes of death worldwide, and that it is a critical challenge in all regions and countries and disproportionately affects developing countries, where 99 per cent of tuberculosis- associated deaths occur, and furthermore recognize that the epidemic is exacerbated by the rise of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and the heavy burden of tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS, and other co-morbidities such as diabetes, that one quarter of the world\u2019s people are infected with the bacterium that causes the disease, and that millions of people ill with tuberculosis are missing out on quality care each year, including on access to affordable diagnostic tests and treatment, especially in developing countries;",
    "7": "Express serious concern that, despite these commitments, tuberculosis remains a cause of an enormous burden of illness, suffering and death, and that stigma and discrimination because of the disease bring enormous costs for individuals affected by tuberculosis and their families, and acknowledge that an adequate multisectoral and intersectoral engagement in the fight against the disease is needed, and that the world needs to refocus efforts on actions and investments, including in research, needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals target of ending the tuberculosis epidemic by 2030;",
    "8": "Recognize that tuberculosis affects populations inequitably and contributes to the cycle of ill health and poverty, that malnutrition and inadequate living conditions contribute to the spread of tuberculosis and its impact upon the community, and that tuberculosis is fundamentally linked to a majority of the leading development challenges addressed by the 2030 Agenda;",
    "9": "Further recognize that tuberculosis is both preventable and curable, yet 40 per cent of people newly affected by tuberculosis are missed by public health reporting systems, and millions do not receive quality care each year, and that tuberculosis can only be eliminated through prevention efforts and access to quality diagnosis, treatment and care, including access to affordable diagnostic tools and drug treatment, effective people-centred and community-based models of care supported by integrated care services, as well as financing innovations, and additional investments in research and development and in the affordable delivery of tuberculosis programmes, especially in developing countries, and recognize that countries that are transitioning from donor to domestic funding face new challenges that may have a negative impact on earlier gains in the fight against tuberculosis;",
    "10": "Recognize that, even though tuberculosis is the leading global cause of death of people living with HIV, in 2016 less than half of the estimated number of cases of tuberculosis in people living with HIV were found and notified, and less than 60 per cent of known tuberculosis patients were tested for HIV, precluding treatment and resulting in preventable deaths;",
    "11": "Recognize that multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is estimated to account for one third of deaths due to antimicrobial resistance globally, and that many of the Sustainable Development Goals may not be attainable if we fail to address antimicrobial resistance, that the grave risks to individual and public health posed by multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are cause for alarm, that only 25 per cent of the estimated number of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases were diagnosed and notified in 2016, such that the vast majority of those in need still lack access to high- quality prevention, treatment and care services and that inadequate investment in tuberculosis case detection is a key obstacle to meeting tuberculosis treatment goals, and furthermore acknowledge that the response to multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis to date has been insufficient, despite the introduction of new rapid diagnostic tests, efforts to scale up disease management and international financing, such as from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, including to help support drug supply, yet globally just over 50 per cent of patients enrolled in treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are successfully treated;",
    "12": " illness and mortality place an additional burden on health and community systems, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and thereby pose a critical challenge that could reverse the progress made against the disease, against antimicrobial resistance and towards the Sustainable Development Goals, and that there is a profound gap in access to quality diagnosis, treatment and care for those affected, and there is still a low treatment success rate for those who are treated, and therefore acknowledge that it is necessary to ensure global collaboration, sustainable and sufficient political buy-in and financial investment from all sources, a strong public health response, including strong and resilient health systems, and additional investment in research, development and innovation, recognizing that innovation has the potential to benefit society at large;",
    "13": "Note with concern that the protection and promotion of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as access for millions of people to tuberculosis health services and to quality, safe, efficacious and affordable tuberculosis diagnostics and treatment, remains challenging, especially in developing countries;",
    "14": "Recognize the profound socioeconomic challenges and financial hardships faced by people affected by tuberculosis, including in obtaining an early diagnosis, in being subject to extremely long treatment regimens, with drugs that could involve severe side effects, as well as in securing integrated support, including from the community, and therefore affirm that all these people require integrated, people- centred prevention, diagnosis, treatment, management of side effects, and care, as well as psychosocial, nutritional and socioeconomic support for successful treatment, including to reduce stigma and discrimination;",
    "15": "Recognize the role played by the Stop TB Partnership/Global Drug Facility, which has, since its creation in 2001, increased access to high-quality and affordable tuberculosis treatment and diagnostics for populations in need and is open as an option to be considered for use by all nations, and therefore encourage all nations to use the Stop TB Partnership/Global Drug Facility;",
