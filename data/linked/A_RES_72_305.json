  "paragraphs": {
    "1": "In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, the Economic and Social Council should continue to strengthen its leadership and policy guidance role, and its role as the central mechanism for coordination of the activities of the United Nations development system and its specialized agencies and supervision of its subsidiary bodies while integrating their analysis throughout its segments. It should also address new and emerging issues in the economic, social, environmental and related fields and provide overall support for the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development. It should promote a coordinated follow- up to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development7 and the outcomes of other major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social, environmental and related fields.",
    "2": "The working modalities of the Economic and Social Council should be guided by the principles of inclusiveness, transparency and flexibility based on the deliberative function of its meetings. It should be a platform for discussion and the exchange of national experiences. The Council should aim at creating synergy and coherence as well as avoiding duplication and overlap in its work to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. It should also ensure an adequate division of labour among its subsidiary bodies and harmonization and coordination of their agendas and work programmes, while ensuring that the principles, critical aspects and implementation gaps of the 2030 Agenda are addressed.",
    "3": "The Economic and Social Council should improve its outcomes and the outcomes of its subsidiary bodies, making them more relevant, coherent and solution- oriented to address implementation challenges and ensuring their follow-up so as to strengthen the impact of the work of the Council.",
    "4": "The General Assembly shall adopt one main theme for the high-level political forum on sustainable development and the Economic and Social Council, bearing in mind the provisions of resolution 70/299 of 29 July 2016. The themes of the segments of the Council shall focus on a particular aspect of the one main theme, bearing in mind their respective functions. The humanitarian affairs segment shall continue to adopt themes based on humanitarian considerations and that are coherent with the main theme of the Council.",
    "5": "The subsidiary bodies of the Economic and Social Council shall similarly adopt their own respective themes, aligned with the main theme, while continuing to address issues or a theme necessary to discharge their other functions.",
    "6": "The themes of the Economic and Social Council segments shall reflect the integrated, indivisible and interlinked nature of the Sustainable Development Goals and the three dimensions of sustainable development, including cross-cutting issues as well as new and emerging issues.",
    "7": "The Economic and Social Council cycle shall continue to run from July to July. To promote linkages in their work and enhance the visibility and impact of the Council, and to encourage focus, coherence and efficiency, Council segments and forums shall be restructured into three groups per Council cycle.",
    "8": "The first group will comprise Economic and Social Council forums. It will include the Development Cooperation Forum every second year and, annually, the forum on financing for development follow-up, the multi-stakeholder forum on science, technology and innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals, the partnership forum and the youth forum, and all other related mandated meetings. These will be organized independently and in a coordinated manner.",
    "9": "The second group will comprise segments that address actions by the United Nations development system and other actors to implement the 2030 Agenda, along with distinct humanitarian assistance. It will include the operational activities for development segment, the humanitarian affairs segment and the special event to discuss the transition from relief to development. These will be organized independently and in a coordinated manner.",
    "10": "The third group will comprise segments and forums that provide overall policy guidance and foster progress in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, contribute to the overall review of the 2030 Agenda at the high-level political forum and look to the future of the advancement of sustainable development. It will include, in this order, the integration segment, the high-level political forum and the high-level segment.",
    "11": "The integration segment will be held for one day immediately before the high- level political forum. It will discuss and consolidate all the inputs of Member States, including case studies and lessons learned, the subsidiary bodies of the Economic and Social Council, the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders to promote the balanced integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development. This segment will thus bring together the key messages from the subsidiary bodies of the Council and the United Nations system on the main theme, develop action-oriented recommendations for follow-up and feed into the high-level political forum. It will also coordinate the work of the subsidiary bodies of the Council, promoting a clearer division of labour among them, and the policies and activities of the specialized agencies relating to the Sustainable Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals. The Secretary-General will present to the Council the annual overview report of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination. Heads of United Nations system entities, Chairs of the subsidiary bodies of the Council and the Executive Secretaries of the regional commissions will also be invited to participate. A dedicated effort will be made in 2019 to improve the role, functioning and impact of the segment along these lines. This will be reviewed as part of the broader review of Council segments and meetings at the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly along with the high-level political forum.",
    "12": "The final day of the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council, following the ministerial segment of the high-level political forum, will focus on future trends and scenarios related to the Council theme, the long-term impact of current trends, such as the contribution of new technologies, in the economic, social and environmental areas on the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals, based on the work of the United Nations and other regional and international organizations and bodies as well as other stakeholders. It should aim at enhancing knowledge-sharing and regional and international cooperation. The outcome of the high-level political forum and the high-level segment will continue to be a negotiated ministerial declaration.

    "15": "The Economic and Social Council should strive to reinforce the linkages between policy and operational functions while continuing to focus on improving the overall impact of operational activities for development of the United Nations system in support of issues relating to national development priorities.

    "16": "The Economic and Social Council should, furthermore, provide improved overall coordination and guidance on operational activities for development, on a system-wide basis, to the governing bodies of the United Nations development system, in keeping with the mandates of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review. This includes holding the segment close to the annual session of the executive boards of the funds and programmes. With a view to avoiding repetition of discussions, the executive boards that report to the Council should further highlight in their existing reports to the Council the issues requiring examination and identify actions to be taken, guided by the chosen theme. The segment should continue to contribute to the preparations for the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development, through which the General Assembly establishes key system-wide policy orientations for the development cooperation and country-level modalities of the United Nations system.",
    "17": "Through the humanitarian affairs segment, the Economic and Social Council should, in line with paragraph 11 (b) of the annex to General Assembly resolution 68/1 of 20 September 2013, continue to contribute to strengthening the coordination and effectiveness of United Nations humanitarian assistance and support and complement international efforts aimed at addressing humanitarian emergencies, including natural disasters, in order to promote an improved, coordinated response by the United Nations.

    "23": "The current coordination and management meeting shall be renamed the management segment.",
    "24": "The meetings of the management segment will, in principle, last no more than two days, twice per cycle.
