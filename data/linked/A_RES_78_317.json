  "title": "78/317. The Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States: A Renewed Declaration for Resilient Prosperity",
  "paragraphs": {
    "1": "In 1992, at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, we, the international community, formally declared small island developing States a special case both for environment and development and committed to assist them in meeting their sustainable development objectives. This was further promulgated in the first decennial United Nations conference on small island developing States in Barbados in 1994 and was subsequently reiterated at the second conference in Mauritius in 2005 and the third conference in Samoa in 2014.",
    "2": "After three decades and three programmes of action, small island developing States remain a special case for sustainable development, given their unique vulnerabilities. We note the remarkable successes and progress that they have made over the years, and welcome in this regard the ownership, leadership and considerable efforts that have been demonstrated by small island developing States, along with the support provided by the international community.",
    "3": "During this period, small island developing States have and continue to provide stable and democratic governance for their citizenry and have strived to provide productive economies and safe societies throughout unrelenting turbulent global times. Small island developing States were heavily affected by two \u201conce-in-a- generation\u201d crises that struck in 2008 and 2020, while grappling with even more intense and frequent disasters and natural hazards. In addition, they have assumed leadership roles in areas such as finance, climate change and plastics, and are stewards of the ocean, including managing 19.1 per cent of the world\u2019s exclusive economic zones and the resources they hold. Small island developing States have paved the way for many of the most progressive movements in these areas in policy development and the establishment of concrete actions in the multilateral arena.",
    "4": "We remain concerned that small island developing States are facing the unrelenting and compounding impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, disasters and natural hazards, health and other social-related challenges and economic vulnerabilities, as well as the progressive deterioration in their ability to withstand external shocks and enhance their resilience. Successive global crises, along with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, have further exacerbated and negatively compounded the sustainable development of small island developing States.",
    "5": "Small island developing States are inherently and uniquely vulnerable to exogenous shocks owing to, inter alia, their small size, geographical remoteness, highly dispersed populations, the limited scale and undiversified nature of their economies, high dependence on external markets, and extreme exposure to disasters and natural hazards and the effects of climate change. Recognizing vulnerability does not mean that small island developing States exhibit weakness or lack potential for development. Rather, it means recognizing that they are disproportionately impacted in terms of physical destruction and non-economic and economic losses to a far greater scale than elsewhere.",
    "6": " We take note of the concerns expressed by small island developing States that the impacts of climate change could have possible implications on small island developing States, including humanitarian, economic, social, cultural, ecological and, as exacerbated by other factors, security consequences.",
    "7": "In order for small island developing States to achieve sustainable development and resilient prosperity, we must assist small island developing States to diversify their economies and strengthen State and productive capacities. At the same time, the international financial architecture should go further to fully address the unique development circumstances of small island developing States and make accessing concessional finance easier for them, which could mitigate their fiscal constraints and reduce the risk of indebtedness, especially for highly indebted small island developing States, and prevent the reversal of hard-earned development gains. Therefore, the special case of small island developing States must continue to be recognized by the international community and must take into account these new and emerging challenges.",
    "8": "We recognize small island developing States\u2019 need for access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy, particularly renewable energy. Small island developing States are facing significant barriers related to accessing finance, cost of capital, market readiness and upskilling and reskilling workforces needed for just, inclusive and resilient energy transitions.",
    "9": "We reaffirm the importance of freedom, peace and security, respect for all human rights, including the right to development and the right to an adequate standard of living, including the right to food, the rule of law, gender equality, women\u2019s empowerment, reducing inequalities and the overall commitment to just and democratic societies for development.",
    "10": "We recognize that gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment and the full realization of human rights for women and girls have a transformative and multiplier effect on sustainable development and are a driver of economic growth in small island developing States. Women can be powerful agents of change.",
    "11": "Small island developing States aspire to a resilient form of prosperity that is reflected in sustainable development for all in their countries, where economic growth and well-being are sustained and their economies are robust, diversified, adaptable and able to withstand shocks, ensuring social equity and promoting environmental sustainability.",
    "12": "The next 10 years are critical for small island developing States. A new context is emerging wherein the economic, social and environmental as well as geopolitical threats to the development of small island developing States are so great that they can only be ameliorated by a reinvigorated enabling environment that gives meaningful effect to their sustainable development. Without the full support of the international community, small island developing States will endure potentially far-reaching consequences.",
    "13": "We reaffirm the continued applicability of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (Barbados Programme of Action)1 adopted in 1994, the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (Mauritius Strategy)2 of 2005 and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway 3 of 2014 as blueprints setting out the sustainable development priorities of small island developing States.",
    "14": "We recommit to the full and timely implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,4 the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development 5 and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 6 and the Paris Agreement, 7 as well as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030,8 the New Urban Agenda,9 the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and other relevant intergovernmentally agreed development outcomes, frameworks and instruments.",
    "15": "We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 10 including, inter alia, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, as set out in principle 7 thereof.",
    "16": "We, the Heads of State and Government and high-level representatives, having met in St. John\u2019s from 27 to 30 May 2024, at the fourth International Conference on Small Island Developing States, with the participation of civil society, the private sector, youth, academia and other relevant stakeholders, firmly reaffirm our commitment to support small island developing States on their pathway to achieving sustainable development and resilient prosperity, where the progress of today does not compromise the possibilities of tomorrow. Through targeted, results-focused interventions and investments, we will support small island developing States as they exercise full ownership of their new agenda and seek to establish partnerships as equals, upholding values of equity, national ownership, mutual trust, transparency and accountability, and cooperation and promoting benefits across priority areas in their new 10-year agenda. II. What do small island developing States want? A. Build resilient economies",
    "17": "Enhancing inter-island connectivity and linking economies of small island developing States to regional markets and global supply chains, including by integrating them into existing and emerging maritime and multimodal transport and economic corridors, and encouraging sustainable transport initiatives to support small island developing States remains key.",
    "18": "We underscore that small island developing States face substantial structural challenges in building the necessary ecosystem, institutions and capacity for promoting and using science, technology, innovation and digitalization to drive economic growth and sustainable development.",
    "19": "Small island developing States face significant challenges in data collection, analysis, technical and institutional capacity, which hinders evidence-informed policymaking, monitoring progress and accessing development financing, and we emphasize that capacity-building for stronger data governance and management will allow small island developing States to support better data collection, protection, transparency and data sharing.",
    "20": "We welcome and call for support for the efforts of small island developing States in establishing a Small Island Developing States Centre of Excellence in Antigua and Barbuda that will be launched at the fourth International Conference on Small Island Developing States, which will include, inter alia, a small island developing States data hub, a technology and innovation mechanism and an Island Investment Forum.",

B. Foster safe, healthy and prosperous societies",
    "22": "We underline the need to promote peaceful, prosperous, inclusive societies and safe communities for achieving sustainable development, and to build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Good governance, rule of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms, equal access to fair justice systems, and measures to combat corruption and curb illicit financial flows will be integral to our efforts.",
    "23": "We remain concerned that poverty, including extreme poverty, unemployment, inequality and exclusion continue to disproportionately affect people in vulnerable situations, particularly women, children, youth, persons with disabilities and older persons, and reduces the potential productive capacities in small island developing States. These challenges are compounded by youth unemployment, loss of skilled and semi-skilled labour, through labour mobility, and gender inequality, including unpaid care and domestic work.",
    "24": "The inadequacy of the health and social protection systems of small island developing States and the prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases in small island developing States pose a threat to sustainable development and economic productivity, disproportionately affecting the poorest and those in vulnerable situations.",
    "25": " sets for the future, including in improving the agility of public service delivery and public procurement; (v) (viii) Supporting the advancement of sports as an important enabler of sustainable development, including for its growing contribution to the realization of development and peace in its promotion of tolerance and respect and the contributions it makes to the empowerment of women, young people, children, in particular girls, individuals and communities as well as to health, education and social inclusion objectives. C. A secure future",

D. Environmental protection and planetary sustainability",
    "27": "",
    "28": "Small island developing States are gravely concerned that global emissions are not in line with modelled global mitigation pathways consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, and that there is a rapidly narrowing window out to 2030 to raise ambition and implement existing commitments in order to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels within reach, which is crucial to the sustainable development of small island developing States.",
    "29": "Small island developing States have extraordinary marine and terrestrial biodiversity that, in many cases, is fundamental to their livelihoods, culture and identity, but their vulnerabilities are drastically limiting the resources and means by which they can protect their ecosystems and the natural environment. The ocean and its resources are under considerable stress from anthropogenic sources, impacting small island developing States, which are especially dependent on their maritime resources for their food security and livelihoods.",
    "30": " satellite monitoring, and the establishment and strengthened management of area-based management tools, including marine protected areas and integrated coastal zone management; and other effective area-based conservation measures and locally managed marine areas; (iii) Strengthening partnerships at the subregional, regional and international levels to prevent and reduce plastic pollution in the marine environment and support investment in modern integrated solid waste management systems; (c) Conserve, restore and sustainably use biodiversity by: (i) Developing, enhancing and applying environmental statistics frameworks in their national statistical systems, such as natural capital accounting framework, including ecosystems services valuation, to assess the contribution of natural ecosystems to economies and inform policy decisions and development; (ii) Supporting small island developing States to identify financing and capacity gaps in meeting biodiversity objectives and develop partnerships, particularly with the private sector, to develop innovative strategies to bridge these gaps; (iii) Updating the programme of work on island biodiversity adopted under the Convention on Biological Diversity,12 particularly in the context of the ongoing process to identify scientific and technical needs of small island developing States; (iv) Developing an island biodiversity capacity-building and development action plan, on the basis of the review of the capacity and technology absorption and sustaining abilities of small island developing States and in line with the programme of work on island biodiversity; (v) Acknowledging the important roles and contributions of Indigenous Peoples and local communities as custodians of biodiversity and as partners in its conservation, restoration and sustainable use; and ensuring the rights, knowledge, including traditional knowledge associated with biodiversity, innovations, worldviews, values and practices of Indigenous Peoples and local communities are respected, and documented and preserved with their free, prior and informed consent, including through their full and effective participation in decision-making, in accordance with relevant national legislation, international instruments, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,13 and human rights law; (d) Mainstream disaster risk reduction by: (i) Increasing local, national and regional capacity, particularly among key national agencies, to improve coordination with international, regional and humanitarian partners and donor Governments, as appropriate, to prevent and reduce disaster risk and to respond to intensifying disasters; (ii) Building more robust multi-hazard risk governance, including the development of national legislative frameworks for disaster risk reduction and strengthened local authorities and community-based disaster risk management approaches that can capture whole-of-government and whole-of-society actions that are also gender-responsive and disability-inclusive; (iii) Strengthening disaster preparedness, including multi-hazard early warning systems and capacity to take early action, through initiatives such as Early Warnings for All and Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems, timely evacuation planning, planning for relocation of communities, and developing post-disaster needs assessments; (iv) Implementing creative arrangements and risk reduction mechanisms that allow small island developing States to access low and concessional financing rates, including government guarantees and insurance schemes, as appropriate; (v) Reducing disaster risks, including by building protective infrastructure and enhancing resilience of freshwater and other water systems, and using the recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction phases after a disaster to increase resilience, and developing systems for managing evacuations and the distribution of basic relief support. III. How do small island developing States get there?",
