  "paragraphs": {
    "1": "Reiterates that the States parties to the United Nations human rights instruments should take into account, in their nomination of members to the human rights treaty bodies, that these committees shall be composed of persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights, consideration being given to the usefulness of the participation of persons having legal experience and to equal representation of women and men, and that members shall serve in their personal capacity, and also reiterates that, in the elections to the human rights treaty bodies, strong consideration shall be given to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the different forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems;",
    "2": "Urges the States parties to the United Nations human rights instruments, including the bureau members, to include this matter in the agenda of each meeting and/or conference of States parties to those instruments in order to initiate a debate on ways and means to ensure equitable geographical distribution in the membership of the human rights treaty bodies, based on previous recommendations of the former Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council and the provisions of the present resolution;",
    "3": "Encourages the States parties to the United Nations human rights instruments to consider and adopt concrete actions, inter alia, the possible establishment of quotas by geographical region for membership of the treaty bodies, thereby ensuring the paramount objective of equitable geographical distribution in the membership of those human rights bodies;",
    "4": "Recommends, when considering the possible allocation of seats on each treaty body on a regional basis, the introduction of flexible procedures that encompass the following criteria: (a) Each of the five regional groups established by the General Assembly is allocated seats on each treaty body in equivalent proportion to the number of States parties to the instrument in that group; (b) There must be provision for periodic revisions of the allocation of seats in order to reflect relative changes in the level of treaty ratification in each regional group; (c) Automatic periodic revisions should be envisaged in order to avoid amending the text of the instrument when the quotas are revised;",
    "5": "Stresses that the process needed to achieve the goal of equitable geographical distribution in the membership of human rights treaty bodies can contribute to raising awareness of the importance of gender balance, the representation of the principal legal systems and the principle that the members of the treaty bodies shall be elected and shall serve in their personal capacity, and shall be of high moral character, acknowledged impartiality and recognized competence in the field of human rights;",
    "6": "Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, to submit to the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session a comprehensive updated report in this regard, including information on any steps taken by States parties at meetings or conferences of States parties to address the matter of equitable geographical distribution in the membership of the human rights treaty bodies, as well as concrete recommendations on the implementation of the present resolution;",
