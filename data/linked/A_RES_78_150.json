  "title": "78/150. Achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls for realizing all Sustainable Development Goals",
  "paragraphs": {
    "1": "Reaffirms that the commitment to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls will make a crucial contribution to progress across all the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, that the achievement of full human potential and of sustainable development is not possible if all women and girls continue to be denied their human rights and opportunities, and that the systematic mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development3 is crucial;",
    "2": "Invites Member States to strengthen the capacity of national financial institutions to reach out to those who have no access to banking, insurance and other financial services, particularly women and women-led micro-, small and medium- sized enterprises, sustainable and inclusive businesses, and digital entrepreneurs, in urban and especially in rural areas, as well as to develop and implement policies and programmes to support women\u2019s entrepreneurship, in particular opportunities for new women entrepreneurs;",
    "3": "Calls upon Member States to ensure women\u2019s equal opportunities in education, training, business, entrepreneurship and decent jobs, reduce gender barriers to employment, address the gender wage gap, reduce occupational segregation and increase the participation of people in vulnerable situations, including workers in the informal economy;",
    "4": "Urges Member States to take comprehensive, multisectoral, coordinated, effective and gender-responsive measures to prevent and eliminate all forms of gender-based violence and address structural and underlying causes and risk factors of gender inequalities;",
    "5": "Calls upon Member States to promote a gender-equitable division of unpaid care and domestic work, including through the promotion of the equitable sharing of responsibilities between women and men within the household and by prioritizing, inter alia, social protection policies and infrastructure development, bearing in mind that women spend 2.8 more hours than men on unpaid care and domestic work, a factor that contributes to greater time burdens on women and substantially limits their participation in the social, economic and political spheres, and considering that, on the current trajectory, the gap between the time spent by women and men on unpaid care will narrow slightly, but by 2050, women globally will still be spending 9.5 per cent more time or 2.3 more hours per day on unpaid care work than men;",
    "6": "Urges Member States to support efforts to enable all women to have leadership and decision-making roles at all levels, and work towards women\u2019s and youth\u2019s equal, full and meaningful participation, including in all spheres and levels of public and political life, bearing in mind that, at the current pace, women\u2019s share of workplace management positions will reach only 30 per cent by 2050;",
    "7": "Reaffirms the importance of identifying and eliminating all forms of discrimination against women and girls in the context of climate change, environmental degradation and disasters, in relation to land tenure security and access to, ownership of and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance, and ensuring women\u2019s and girls\u2019 access to justice and accountability for violations of their human rights, with particular attention given to older women, widows and young women;",
    "8": "Also reaffirms the need to strengthen the efforts to realize the right to education for all women and girls, eliminating barriers in this regard, ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education, training and skills development, promoting lifelong learning opportunities, and supporting women\u2019s and girls\u2019 participation in all sectors, especially those in which they are not equally represented, in particular science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and strengthening international cooperation on these issues;",
    "9": "Requests the Secretary-General to report on the topic of the resolution, within an existing report in the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Issues Committee (Third Committee) of the General Assembly at its eightieth session."
