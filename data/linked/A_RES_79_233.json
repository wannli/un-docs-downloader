  "title": "79/233. Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024\u20132034",
  "paragraphs": {
    "1": " lingering effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID\u201119) pandemic, geopolitical tensions and conflicts, food and energy crises, high transportation and trade costs, high interest rates, inflation, high indebtedness, climate change, biodiversity loss, desertification and pollution.",
    "2": "The years of cascading challenges, in which a health and socioeconomic crisis has shaken everyone, individually and collectively, threaten the attainment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 1 and all the Sustainable Development Goals. The world is plagued by growing poverty, hunger and malnutrition, inequalities, human rights violations, digital divides within countries and between developed and developing countries, vaccine inequity, complex humanitarian emergencies and armed conflict, insecurity, pandemics, environmental degradation, climate change and disasters. The situation for landlocked developing countries is particularly bleak. The situation demands urgent mobilization of our collective resources, decisive actions by all and innovative solutions to the unprecedented challenges. In this context, we strongly reaffirm our unwavering commitment to work tirelessly for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals in a balanced and integrated manner in its three dimensions, including by taking tangible steps and calling for greater action and extraordinary measures by all countries; and strengthened international and multilateral cooperation to support the landlocked developing countries in this endeavour and to reach the furthest behind first.",
    "3": "We are guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including full respect for international law. It is grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,2 international human rights treaties, the United Nations Millennium Declaration3 and the 2005 World Summit Outcome.4 It is informed by other instruments such as the Declaration on the Right to Development. 5 We recognize the need to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies that provide equal access to justice and that are based on respect for human rights, on effective rule of law and good governance at all levels and on transparent, effective and accountable institutions.",
    "4": "We further reaffirm our commitment to enhancing our efforts for the full and timely implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development,6 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 7 and the Paris Agreement 8 and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030,9 particularly with regard to the special development needs and challenges of landlocked developing countries.",
    "5": "We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 10 including, inter alia, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, as set out in principle 7 thereof.",
    "6": "We note that mixed progress was made in the implementation of the six priority areas of the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014\u20132024. 11 The combined effects of the COVID\u201119 pandemic, geopolitical tensions and conflict, and climate change, affected progress. We note with concern that the severe financing deficit, in particular for infrastructure, limited data and technical capacity constraints also undermined progress. Additionally, adverse global economic conditions characterized by tepid growth, surging inflation, increased pressure on energy, food and finance, supply chain disruptions and elevated trade costs continue to affect the recovery efforts of landlocked developing countries. Furthermore, landlocked developing countries were significantly affected by disasters, many of which are exacerbated by climate change, biodiversity loss and disasters, such as desertification, recurrent droughts, melting glaciers, floods and glacier lake outburst floods.",
    "7": "We recognize the limited progress that has been made during the implementation period of the Vienna Programme of Action. Considerable efforts have contributed to the realization of meaningful outcomes, including in facilitating trade, fostering regional integration, accession of landlocked developing and transit countries to international conventions for the promotion of transit and trade, and completing missing links and improving the quality of infrastructure for increased connectivity.",
    "8": "However, we note with concern that progress fell short of the goals and targets set out in the Vienna Programme of Action. Economic growth across the landlocked developing countries was modest and insufficient to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality, particularly among women, children and people in vulnerable situations, as well as people working in informal sectors.",
    "9": "We are concerned that landlocked developing countries have made very limited progress towards achieving structural transformation. We also note with concern that the economic structure of the landlocked developing countries continues to be characterized by a low level of diversification, with exports concentrated in a limited number of products, which tend to have low value addition and to be greatly susceptible to current and possible future external shocks and hazards. Road, rail, water and air transport infrastructure, and connecting river ports and seaports, remain insufficiently funded and underdeveloped, with huge missing links and inadequate maintenance.",
    "10": "We note with concern that the share of global merchandise exports of landlocked developing countries remains marginal, at only 1.1 per cent of the total global share in 2022. There was a growing interest in regional integration and cooperation among landlocked developing countries. The number of regional trade agreements that each landlocked developing country is a party to has increased, on average, from 3.3 in 2014 to 4.3 in 2023.",
    "11": "We express our concern that, while there was some progress in the allocation of official development assistance and aid for trade to landlocked developing countries, foreign direct investment flows declined and have largely been concentrated in natural resources. Furthermore, a large number of landlocked developing countries are either in debt distress or at a high risk of it.",
    "12": "We note that technology is rapidly changing the global economic landscape. It is reshaping work processes, production and distribution methods and consumption patterns. It is driving new innovations and fostering growth opportunities. It can also bridge the existing digital divides, including the growing gender digital divide, and accelerate progress for inclusive and sustainable development. Despite extraordinary opportunities, landlocked developing countries are not able to fully harness its potentials. This is due to a number of constraints, including infrastructure gaps, the relatively high cost of information and communications technology services, low digital literacy rates, insufficient regulatory frameworks and the high cost of accessing submarine cables.",
    "13": "We recognize that, during the implementation period, there was significant development of regional, subregional and multilateral initiatives to support transit. Progress was also made in ratifying the relevant legal agreements. Tools were developed to improve transit, such as the World Customs Organization transit guidelines, electronic consignment note and electronic TIR. Some progress was made in some corridors on the specific objective of the Vienna Programme of Action of reducing travel time along corridors.",
    "14": "We also note that some progress was made in completing missing links and generally improving the quality of infrastructure for increased connectivity of landlocked developing countries, but challenges remain. Several highway networks and railway lines were commissioned in those countries during the implementation period, but many more are needed.",
    "15": "We recognize the challenges that hampered the full implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action, including the persisting insufficiency and inadequacy of means of implementation, a lack of capacity in formulating financially viable infrastructure projects, low flows of official development assistance, the concentration of investment inflows towards natural resources, high debt vulnerabilities and multiple international crises, including the COVID\u201119 pandemic, that have had a disproportionately severe impact on the landlocked developing countries.",
    "16": "We reaffirm the importance of promoting unfettered, efficient and cost-effective access to and from the sea by all means of transport, on the basis of the freedom of transit, and other related measures, in accordance with applicable rules of international law. We reaffirm the need to reduce trade transaction costs and transport costs, and to develop adequate transit transport infrastructure networks. We recognize the continued importance of structural transformation, value addition, industrialization and diversification.",
    "17": "We recognize that increased participation in international trade, anchored in a strengthened multilateral trading system that is equitable and fair, is critical to the economic growth of landlocked developing countries and the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals. We recognize the crucial role of transport corridors as the backbone of transportation networks, linking major gateways and hubs, to enhance landlocked developing countries\u2019 connectivity to markets, achieve efficient transit and reduce transport costs.",
    "18": "We also recognize the importance of investment in supporting human capital development through inclusive, equitable, quality education and skills training for all, including for those in vulnerable situations. We acknowledge the importance of quality science, technology, engineering and mathematics education and institutional capacity development in landlocked developing countries in order to accelerate poverty reduction and effective sustainable development measures.",
    "19": " domestic resource mobilization and substantially reducing illicit financial flows, and strengthening the enabling environment for investments.",
    "20": "We express concern that the gender gap persists across all areas, including with respect to assets, inputs and services. We reaffirm that gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls will make a crucial contribution to progress across all the Sustainable Development Goals and targets in landlocked developing countries. We underline the urgent need to invest in and strengthen efforts to support the empowerment of all women and girls, including by removing all legal, social and economic barriers to achieving gender equality.",
    "21": "We further recognize that strong bilateral, multilateral and multi-stakeholder partnerships are critical and commit to working in collaboration with academia, civil society and the private sector to drive innovation that will identify solutions to pressing development challenges and the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Programme of Action, including through transparent, effective and accountable public-private partnerships.",
    "22": "We recognize that landlocked developing countries, due to their structural constraints, in addition to their landlockedness, require additional efforts, including additional borrowing, to stimulate their development, which affects their fiscal space and in turn impacts the policy space they require to support their sustainable development. This situation creates a bottleneck in financing for development and demands responses and solutions tailored to the specificities of these countries.",
    "23": "With this in mind, the present Programme of Action determines a renewed and strengthened commitment by the landlocked developing countries, transit countries, development partners, the United Nations system and international, regional and subregional organizations, multilateral and regional development banks and the international community as a whole. It is grounded in the overarching goals of addressing the special development needs, vulnerabilities and challenges of landlocked developing countries arising from their landlockedness, remoteness and geographical constraints in a more coherent manner to contribute to an enhanced rate of sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, effective participation in international trade and the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty. This will be achieved through a reinvigorated global partnership for sustainable development based on scaled-up and ambitious means of implementation and diverse support for the landlocked developing countries through forging the widest possible coalition of multi-stakeholder partnerships. We will also promote a disaster risk-informed approach to sustainable development at the local, national, regional and global levels and accelerate progress on integrating disaster risk reduction into policies, programmes and investments at all levels.",
    "24": "We emphasize that the present Programme of Action is based on a comprehensive, results-oriented, quantifiable, forward-looking, coherent, renewed and strengthened global partnership for landlocked developing countries that is fully aligned with the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Sendai Framework and the Paris Agreement, between landlocked developing countries and the transit countries and their development partners, as well as with the relevant international and regional organizations, the private sector, civil society and other relevant stakeholders.",
    "25": "",
    "26": "We invite the landlocked developing countries, transit countries, their development partners, the United Nations system and all other relevant stakeholders to implement the relevant actions, agreed upon in the present Programme of Action in its five priority areas, in a coordinated, coherent and expeditious manner consistent with national priorities. We also call upon relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and invite international organizations and relevant regional and subregional organizations, to integrate the Programme of Action into their programmes of work, as appropriate, within their respective mandates.",
    "27": "We emphasize that partnerships between landlocked developing countries and transit countries are mutually beneficial for the improvement and constant maintenance of their infrastructure connectivity and of technical and administrative arrangements in their transport, customs and logistics systems. Efficient transit transport systems, strong collaborative efforts in multimodal transport infrastructure development and interlinkage, the promotion of an enabling legal environment and institutional arrangements and strong national leadership on cooperative arrangements between landlocked developing countries and transit countries are also crucial for achieving structural transformation and sustainable economic growth and development.",
    "28": "We underscore that the ownership, leadership and primary responsibility for development in landlocked developing countries lies with the landlocked developing countries themselves as articulated through their own national economic and development policies and strategies. We nevertheless emphasize that the development of the landlocked developing countries rests not only upon themselves but with the collective efforts and essential support, cooperation and development assistance of the international community.",
    "29": "We reaffirm that renewed and strengthened partnerships with development partners will be crucial for the full and timely implementation of the present Programme of Action. The international community, including financial and development institutions, multilateral organizations and agencies and donor countries, is urged to provide adequate financial and technical support to advance the specific objectives listed herein. Regional and subregional cooperation or integration should also play an important role in successfully addressing the specific problems of landlocked developing countries.",
    "30": "We further welcome and re-emphasize the role of international development cooperation, particularly North-South cooperation, which remains a fundamental catalyst for sustainable development, in mutually agreed areas of cooperation within the framework of South-South and triangular cooperation, which is an important complement to, and not a substitute for, North-South cooperation.",
    "31": "We note the importance of economic, political and cultural ties at various levels as contributors to long-term regional prosperity, stability and peace.",
    "32": "We recognize that people, especially the large proportion of youth and working- age population in landlocked developing countries, are critical assets for their development. It is estimated that, between 2024 and 2034, the population in the landlocked developing countries will increase by 135 million, to 726 million people. Young people constitute a tremendous and essential asset worth investing in, opening the door to an unparalleled multiplier effect.",
    "33": "",
    "34": "The present Programme of Action will have five priority areas for action, as follows: Priority area 1: Structural transformation and science, technology and innovation Priority area 2: Trade, trade facilitation and regional integration Priority area 3: Transit, transport and connectivity Priority area 4: Enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change and disasters Priority area 5: Means of implementation.",
    "35": "The fulfilment of commitments in these areas will be supported through additional dedicated actions on implementation, follow-up and monitoring. Priority area 1: Structural transformation and science, technology and innovation",
    "36": "We recognize that the landlocked developing countries face major structural impediments to their sustainable development, including weak productive and supply capacities and lack of advancement in science, technology and innovation.",
    "37": "We are concerned that many landlocked developing countries have achieved limited economic diversification, remained dependent on a few commodities, and continued to be positioned at the lower ends of regional and global value chains.",
    "38": "We note with concern that the landlocked developing countries have been among the worst affected by multiple and interlinked global crises, including the COVID\u201119 pandemic and its lingering effects, climate change, and geopolitical tensions and conflicts in different parts of the world, which have derailed their progress toward structural transformation and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.",
    "39": "We recognize that structural transformation that prioritizes economic diversification, especially by promoting value addition and industrialization, and leveraging the power of science, technology and innovation, is critical to support the landlocked developing countries to overcome their unique challenges, build resilience against current and possible future shocks and hazards, and achieve their development ambitions. I. Productive capacity development",
    "40": "We recognize that many landlocked developing countries have weak productive capacities that constrain their ability to foster technology spillovers across sectors, to produce efficiently and effectively, to diversify their economies, and to create productive and sustainable employment.",
    "41": "We emphasize that sustainable agricultural production, food security, nutrition and food safety are key elements for the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions.",
    "42": "",
    "43": "We are also concerned that the services sector of the landlocked developing countries remains concentrated in lower value-added activities and with limited knowledge-intensive services.",
    "44": "We recognize the importance of further development of human capital as a critical factor in the utilization of all other productive capacities. The landlocked developing countries need more support to increase the access of their people, particularly women and the youth, to quality education and training to improve labour productivity and meet evolving skills needs.",
    "45": "We recognize that the landlocked developing countries need enhanced support from development partners to further develop their productive capacities, including through support for science, technology and innovation, labour productivity and entrepreneurial capabilities, the specialization of sectors, enterprises and farms, and capital and resource accumulation.",
    "46": "We also recognize the importance of the creative economy in implementing the 2030 Agenda for all countries, including for landlocked developing countries, and the need for supporting actions undertaken nationally and internationally to secure the recognition of the true value of creative economy.",
    "47": "Acknowledging that pursuing circular economy approaches as a pathway to achieving sustainable consumption and production patterns, and encouraging approaches such as the circular economy, life cycle and other approaches, as well as zero-waste initiatives, can contribute to addressing climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation and the impact of water scarcity, pollution and the impact thereof on human health, thus contributing to the achievement of related goals under the 2030 Agenda and other internationally agreed environmental goals. Targets: \u2022 Increase labour productivity and decent employment opportunities across all productive sectors of the landlocked developing countries, including manufacturing, services and agriculture, with a particular focus on women and youth, by 50 per cent by 2034. \u2022 Double the output of services sectors in landlocked developing countries by 2034, especially tourism and high-productivity, knowledge-intensive sectors, with a view to increasing their contribution to the economies of the landlocked developing countries. \u2022 Establish regional agriculture research hubs to support the efforts of landlocked developing countries in promoting sustainable agriculture sectors to be financed exclusively by voluntary contributions. \u2022 Ensure increased access to inclusive, equitable and quality education, training and skills development, including science, technology, engineering and mathematics education, with a particular focus on bridging the digital divides, including the gender digital divide. \u2022 Promote targeted technological and financial support and capacity-building for landlocked developing countries to facilitate a smooth digital transformation for sustainable development.

Priority area 2: Trade, trade facilitation and regional integration I. International trade",
    "104": "We recognize that international trade offers extraordinary opportunities for achieving economic growth, job creation and sustainable development. However, landlocked developing countries are not able to harness their potential of international trade owing in particular to a lack of territorial access to the sea, remoteness from world markets and high transit costs and risks. These factors have severely constrained the ability of landlocked developing countries to benefit from the gains of trade to enhance their socioeconomic development.",
    "105": "",

    "218": "We are concerned that climate change and natural hazards have a severe impact on landlocked developing countries, particularly on their lives and livelihoods, economy, infrastructure, settlements and other assets. These impacts often come in succession and trigger secondary effects such as famine and disease outbreaks and can exacerbate biodiversity loss. In arid and semi-arid areas, climate impacts on agricultural productivity may be compounded by limited water availability.",
    "219": "We encourage partnerships to strengthen the understanding of disaster risk, including the impacts of climate change and, more broadly, systemic risk and its application in decision-making in landlocked developing countries, including through disaster risk reduction education, comprehensive risk management, building academic and scientific capacity, the utilization of frontier technologies and supporting traditional, Indigenous and local knowledge and practices.",
    "220": "",
    "221": "We note the interest and commitment of the landlocked developing countries to develop a dedicated work programme on landlocked developing countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",
    "222": "We note the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction.13",
    "223": "We emphasize that landlocked developing countries are also home to certain minerals critical for just, sustainable and inclusive transitions and the opportunity that these minerals offer to support economic diversification and inclusive economic growth, structural transformation and industrialization, and poverty and inequality reduction, while minimizing negative environmental and social impacts of minerals development in mineral-exporting landlocked developing countries.",
    "224": "We express appreciation that all parties to the Paris Agreement, including all landlocked developing countries, have communicated nationally determined contributions that demonstrate progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goal, most of which provided the information necessary to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding.",
    "225": "We emphasize the need for accelerated implementation of domestic mitigation measures, including in landlocked developing countries, in line with the Paris Agreement.",
    "226": "We also emphasize the urgent need to strengthen integrated, holistic and balanced non\u2011market approaches in accordance with article 6, paragraph 8, of the Paris Agreement, in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, in a coordinated and effective manner, including through mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity-building, as appropriate.",
    "227": "We recognize that enhanced access to international climate finance is important to support mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and also recognize the ongoing efforts in this regard. I. Adaptation",
    "228": "We emphasize that it is essential to scale up support to landlocked developing countries and increase its effectiveness, to build resilience and strengthen adaptation planning and implementation to address the worsening impacts of climate change, safeguard progress on the Sustainable Development Goals and support the achievement of the other priority areas of the new Programme of Action. Targets: \u2022 Landlocked developing countries that have not yet done so to have in place national adaptation plans, policies and planning processes by 2025 and to have progressed in implementing them by 2030. \u2022 Strengthen the support for the implementation of adaptation projects and programmes in landlocked developing countries, in line with the global goal on adaptation and the United Arab Emirates Framework for Global Climate Resilience, as appropriate. We commit to taking the following actions:",
    "229": "We commit to support landlocked developing countries in their preparation and implementation of national adaptation strategies to address their priorities, including through the formulation of national adaptation plans and the subsequent implementation of the policies, programmes and projects therein, in line with the global goal on adaptation and the United Arab Emirates Framework for Global Climate Resilience, as appropriate.",
    "230": "We reaffirm our commitment to scale up support to landlocked developing countries for the preparation and implementation of adaptation projects and the development of climate-resilient critical infrastructure such as transport, energy, health and educational facilities, water, electricity and information and communications technologies. II. Disaster risk reduction",
    "231": "We note with concern that climate change is making natural hazards even more frequent and intense. Landlocked developing countries are increasingly affected by floods, heatwaves, storms, droughts and glacial lake outburst floods. A number of landlocked developing countries are located in seismically active regions, with a high risk of earthquakes and secondary hazards, such as landslides, which cause widescale damage to infrastructure, property, health and sanitation, and loss of life. Landlocked developing countries suffer disproportionately high human and economic losses from disasters, which further compound the socioeconomic impacts of the recent COVID\u201119 pandemic and other crises. Disasters, among other factors, impact ecosystems, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss.",
    "232": "We note with concern that, between 2013 and 2022, disaster mortality rates averaged 2.12 deaths annually per 100,000 population in reporting landlocked developing countries, significantly higher than the global average of 1.15 per 100,000 population. Landlocked developing countries also accounted for 4.14 per cent of globally reported economic losses between 2015 and 2022, while having only 1.05 per cent of the gross domestic product of reporting countries. We recognize that in 2022 only 59 per cent of the landlocked developing countries reported having multi-hazard early warning systems in place, which are among the most effective ways of reducing mortality and economic losses from natural hazards.",
    "233": "We reaffirm the importance of strong early warning systems for landlocked developing countries\u2019 preparedness for disasters and the need for support in strengthening early warning systems as well as the promotion of early action. To ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water or climate events through life-saving early warning systems, as called for in the Early Warnings for All initiative, special attention will need to be given to landlocked developing countries due to their notable lack of early warning systems. We also underline the need for the development, strengthening and implementation of local, national and regional strategies and platforms, to take action to achieve the priorities and targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030.",
    "234": "We are deeply concerned that coverage of and accessibility to multi-hazard early warning systems, in particular for people in vulnerable situations, remains inadequate and emphasize the need to urgently extend the reach of multi-hazard early warning systems in landlocked developing countries, in particular by strengthening the means of implementation.",
    "235": " comprehensive; and encourage the allocation of more resources to ex-ante instruments for building resilience, including new financing approaches which incentivize disaster risk reduction and sustainable reduction of landlocked developing countries\u2019 vulnerabilities to disasters. Targets: \u2022 Reduce disaster risk in landlocked developing countries through urgent and full implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u2013 2030, including the call to action contained in the political declaration of the high-level meeting on the midterm review of the Sendai Framework.14 \u2022 Embed disaster risk reduction at the core of development policies and investments for structural economic transformation in landlocked developing countries. \u2022 Develop and strengthen local, national and regional strategies and platforms for disaster risk reduction to achieve the priorities for action and targets of the Sendai Framework. \u2022 Support and reinforce, as appropriate, the existing comprehensive multi-hazard early warning systems and comprehensive multi-hazard crisis mitigation and resilience-building measures for landlocked developing countries. We commit to taking the following actions:",

    "237": "We commit to the strengthening of early warning systems to help landlocked developing countries\u2019 preparedness for disasters, many of which are exacerbated by climate change, and ensuring that landlocked developing countries are not left behind among the priority countries of the Secretary-General\u2019s Early Warnings for All initiative.",
    "238": "We commit to carrying out multidimensional and comprehensive risk assessments, recognizing that implementation of the Sendai Framework can address drivers of vulnerability and exposure to build resilience and reduce humanitarian impacts and needs.",
    "239": "We call upon development partners to support the provision of adequate, sustainable and timely means of implementation through capacity-building, financial and technical assistance and transfer of technology, on mutually agreed terms, to landlocked developing countries, to enhance the collection, analysis and dissemination of disaster-related data and strengthen the role of national statistical and planning offices.",
    "240": "We invite the private sector and insurance markets to support landlocked developing countries to develop risk financing mechanisms and innovative and sustainable financing solutions, which increase the volume, efficiency and effectiveness of financial flows towards risk prevention at the local, national, and regional levels.",
    "241": "We invite the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group and other multilateral and regional development banks to consider vulnerability and climate change impacts in landlocked developing countries in their decision-making and debt sustainability analysis.",
    "242": "We request development partners, relevant entities of the United Nations system, international financial institutions and development banks, as well as the private sector and foundations, to continue to support landlocked developing countries in formulating and implementing national disaster risk reduction strategies to reduce risk and build resilience. III. Climate finance",
    "243": "We note that, while support and funding has been provided for climate change adaptation and mitigation in landlocked developing countries, including from the Global Environment Facility and the Green Climate Fund, there remain financing needs.",
    "244": "We recognize that the Technology Mechanism composed of the Technology Executive Committee and the Climate Technology Centre and Network, under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, is critical in promoting and facilitating enhanced action in technology development and transfer to address climate change.",
    "245": "We recognize the role of the Paris Committee on Capacity-building as a means to address gaps and needs in implementing and further enhancing capacity-building in countries in special situations, including the landlocked developing countries, for addressing climate action. Targets: \u2022 Mobilize an increased amount of adaptation finance to landlocked developing countries. \u2022 Scale up capacity-building and technology transfer to landlocked developing countries to address climate change. We commit to taking the following actions:",
    "246": "We recall that article 9, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement provides that developed country parties shall provide financial resources to assist developing country parties with respect to both mitigation and adaptation in continuation of their existing obligations under the Convention.",
    "247": "We also recall that article 9, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement provides that other parties are encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily.",
    "248": "We further recall that article 9, paragraph 3, of the Paris Agreement provides that, as part of a global effort, developed country parties should continue to take the lead in mobilizing climate finance from a wide variety of sources, instruments and channels, noting the significant role of public funds, through a variety of actions, including supporting country-driven strategies, and taking into account the needs and priorities of developing country parties. Such mobilization of climate finance should represent a progression beyond previous efforts.",
    "249": "We reaffirm our commitment to provide information on financial, technology transfer and capacity-building support provided to landlocked developing countries in line with the Paris Agreement.",
    "250": "",

    "252": "We urge relevant United Nations system organizations and other international and regional development and financial institutions to provide capacity-building support to landlocked developing countries to enhance investment in projects that contribute to climate action in all sectors. IV. Resilient infrastructure development",
    "253": "We note that disasters, many of which are exacerbated by climate change, weaken infrastructure, including railroads, roads, hydroelectric plants and other energy infrastructure, housing, schools, hospitals and other health facilities and public buildings; impact communication routes, such as international waterways, which are essential for trade, energy and transportation; and impose a direct cost on transit trade, which consequently limits the sustainable development efforts in landlocked developing countries and their ability to compete in global markets.",
    "254": "We note that quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure has the potential to promote sustainable development in landlocked developing countries and avoid regresses through damages and disruptions caused by disasters. This is in line with the targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 9, on resilient infrastructure. Targets: \u2022 Strengthen disaster and climate risk analysis as an integral part of resilient infrastructure development and maintenance policies, plans and programmes. \u2022 Continue to provide financial and technical assistance to landlocked developing countries for building and maintaining nationally and regionally integrated, quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient as well as climate- and disaster- resilient infrastructure in sectors such as transport, energy and information and communications technology. We commit to taking the following actions:",
    "255": "We commit to strengthening analysis on disaster risks, including the impacts of climate change, as an integral part of sustainable and resilient infrastructure development, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, maintenance policies, plans and programmes. We also commit to implementing appropriate monitoring systems to facilitate compliance of projects with guidelines and requirements.",
    "256": "We commit further to developing regionally integrated, sustainable, climate- and disaster-resilient transport, energy and information and communications technology infrastructure. We encourage development partners, including multilateral development banks, to provide resources to landlocked developing countries for building and maintaining climate- and disaster-resilient infrastructure, which is increasingly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change.

VI. Biodiversity loss",
    "260": "We note that many landlocked developing countries are both biodiversity-rich and also have significant natural resources. We recognize that the economies of the landlocked developing countries are highly dependent on the flow of goods and services that nature generates. Biodiversity and healthy ecosystems provide essential resources that directly support a range of economic activities, food security and nutrition and social services. It is a matter of concern that landlocked developing countries experience important ecosystem and biodiversity losses. For instance, in landlocked developing countries, land covered by forests has declined from 17.0 per cent in 2015 to 16.6 per cent in 2020, while the world average has remained constant.",
    "261": "We affirm that the landlocked developing countries\u2019 rich biodiversity and natural resource endowment should be conserved and harnessed only in a sustainable, fair and equitable manner to advance economic prosperity and human well-being, in fulfilment of the three objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity 15 and the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. 16 Strategies for sustainable development can help landlocked developing countries to transform and add value to primary products, while addressing their structural vulnerabilities and limited productive capacities.",
    "262": "We welcome the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biodiversity at its fifteenth meeting17 requesting the Global Environment Facility to establish a special trust fund to support the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, to complement existing support and scale up financing to ensure its timely implementation, taking into account the need for adequacy, predictability and timely flow of funds.

We commit to taking the following actions:",
    "263": "We reaffirm the commitment of the parties to the Convention on Biodiversity to the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework in an equitable manner in order to address the needs of landlocked developing countries and to halt and reverse biodiversity loss in those countries by 2030.",
    "264": "We commit to supporting landlocked developing countries in revising or updating national biodiversity strategies and action plans, including by promoting investments in alignment with the new Framework, mobilizing all sectors for increased policy coherence and action, strengthening monitoring, and improving resource mobilization strategies.",
    "265": "We reaffirm the commitment of parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity to substantially and progressively increase the level of financial resources from all sources, including domestic, international, public and private resources, in accordance with article 20 of the Convention, capacity-building, as well as technical and scientific cooperation, and access to and transfer of technology in the context of the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework under the Convention so that landlocked developing countries are able to fully implement their commitments. Priority area 5: Means of implementation",
    "266": "We acknowledge that available resources \u2013 domestic, external, public and private \u2013 have not been sufficient to meet the growing investment and spending needs of landlocked developing countries, despite the benefit of external resources, including international public finance, including official development assistance, foreign direct investment and other private flows, such as remittances and portfolio investment.",
    "267": "We therefore recognize that it is essential that landlocked developing countries, transit countries and their partners take transformative action to realize the full implementation of the Programme of Action, including through substantially increasing resources from all sources. I. Domestic resource mobilization",
    "268": "",
    "269": "Gross domestic savings as a share of gross domestic product in landlocked developing countries reached 24.1 per cent in 2021. However, this figure was much lower than the world average of 28 per cent, suggesting persistent development finance deficits in landlocked developing countries. Targets: \u2022 Progressively increase tax revenue as a proportion of gross domestic product in all landlocked developing countries as appropriate. \u2022 Enhance international cooperation for the recovery of stolen assets and their return to their countries of origin, in accordance with the United Nations Convention against Corruption18 and other applicable instruments. \u2022 Enhance intergovernmental coordination to prevent and combat illicit financial flows. We commit to taking the following actions:",
    "270": "We call upon landlocked developing countries to diversify revenue sources beyond traditional sectors, through promoting sectors such as manufacturing, services and technology to reduce dependency on a few commodities.",
    "271": "We commit to enhancing international tax cooperation and efforts to close international tax loopholes, all of which are aimed at avoiding base erosion and profit shifting.

    "275": "We call for the mobilization of financing mechanisms, in particular existing ones, to provide catalytic financing for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, including those owned by women, in landlocked developing countries to mobilize sustainable private investment flows that promote the Sustainable Development Goals, build resilience to current and possible future crises and shocks, and help to mitigate their impacts.",
    "276": "We recommit to preventing and combating illicit financial flows and strengthening international cooperation and good practices on assets return and recovery to help landlocked developing countries to mobilize resources. We reaffirm our commitment to strive to eliminate safe havens that create incentives for the transfer abroad of stolen assets and illicit financial flows. We will implement our obligations to prevent and combat corruption, bribery and money-laundering in all their forms enshrined in the existing international architecture, in particular in those prescribed in the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. 19 II. Official development assistance and other sources of external finance",
    "277": "We recognize that the provision of official development assistance remains a critical complement to domestic resources in landlocked developing countries and acknowledge that those countries depend on official development assistance to promote their economic development.",
    "278": "We note that official development assistance flows continue to be concentrated in a few landlocked developing countries and many landlocked developing countries receive less official development assistance compared to other developing countries.",
    "279": "We recognize that the volume of development finance in support of landlocked developing countries through traditional and innovative sources needs to be substantially increased, including through concessional finance and the mobilization of the private sector for, inter alia, developing quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure projects. Targets: \u2022 Substantially increase the volume of development finance in support of landlocked developing countries through traditional and innovative sources of finance. \u2022 Enhance the capacity of landlocked developing countries to develop bankable projects and secure financing to effectively address their needs and challenges in a manner that has the greatest social, economic and environmental benefits. We commit to taking the following actions:",
    "280": "We urge development partners, including the developed countries, to honour their respective official development assistance commitments fully and in time and to step up efforts to increase their official development assistance to landlocked developing countries, recognizing the specific needs and challenges of landlocked developing countries, in order to effectively implement the present Programme of Action, recognizing that grant finance and highly concessional finance are of great importance to them.",
    "281": "We urge international action to address the adverse effects of the increasingly financialized commodity markets, including through the establishment of rules to limit speculation, and new countercyclical financing facilities that can mitigate price shocks.",
    "282": "We commit to scaling up innovative finance to landlocked developing countries, to complement and better leverage already established financing mechanisms through innovative tools such as blended finance, and to enhance transparency and accountability in the use of official development assistance for landlocked developing countries, to ensure that funds are effectively and efficiently utilized for sustainable development.",
    "283": "We acknowledge the need to accelerate the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on mutually agreed terms to developing countries, including landlocked developing countries. We urge countries to consider ways to provide landlocked developing countries with greater access to global climate funds, and we will explore the mobilization of additional resources through the issuance of green bonds and other instruments.",
    "284": "We will continue efforts to improve the quality, impact and effectiveness of development cooperation and other international efforts in public finance, including by aligning the support with the national priorities of landlocked developing countries, reducing fragmentation and accelerating the untying of aid.",
    "285": "We urge multilateral development banks to bring forward actions to mobilize and provide additional financing within their mandates, to support landlocked developing countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and deliver the scale of finance needed for infrastructure investments, to improve landlocked developing countries\u2019 connectivity.",

    "320": "We stress that implementation, follow-up and review undertaken at the national, subregional, regional and global levels should be a continuous process, coupled with close coordination and cooperation with transit countries and development partners as well as all other relevant stakeholders, and the process should be aimed at delivering on their commitments, reinforcing partnerships and mutual accountability at all levels and by all actors. I. National reviews",
    "321": "We encourage regular and inclusive reviews of progress on the Programme of Action at the national level that are country-led and country-driven with the full involvement of all relevant stakeholders. National parliaments as well as other institutions can also support these processes.",

    "323": "We emphasize that existing country-level review and reporting mechanisms, including those for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, nationally determined contributions and United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks, should be broadened to cover the review of the Programme of Action and extended to all landlocked developing countries. II. Regional reviews",
    "324": "Follow-up and review at the regional and subregional levels is particularly important as cooperation for transit transport is inherently implemented at the bilateral, subregional and regional levels. We urge in this respect the cooperation of regional and subregional commissions and organizations.",

    "327": "We encourage the regional commissions to undertake biennial regional reviews on the implementation of the new Programme of Action, in close coordination and cooperation with subregional and regional development banks and intergovernmental organizations, and to submit analytical reports on the implementation of the Programme of Action. The relevant regional and subregional organizations and the private sector should be actively involved in the sessions of the regional commissions in that regard.",
    "328": " III. Global-level implementation",
    "329": "We recognize that the implementation and monitoring mechanisms established at the global level should be strengthened and improved with a view to ensuring timely and effective follow-up of the implementation of the Programme of Action, including through better stocktaking of policies and measures at the national, regional and sectoral levels; improved substantive support for the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level; systematic monitoring of relevant developments in other intergovernmental processes and action by the United Nations system organizations and inter-agency processes; and structured support for follow\u2011up from the landlocked developing countries themselves.",

    "332": "Effective linkages will be made with the follow-up and review arrangements of all relevant United Nations conferences, processes and frameworks, including the 2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework. IV. Mainstreaming the Programme of Action",
    "333": "We call upon landlocked developing countries, transit countries, development partners and United Nations system entities to mainstream the Programme of Action into their respective national and sectoral development strategies, development cooperation frameworks and strategic plans for its effective implementation where appropriate. Landlocked developing countries and transit developing countries are encouraged to establish national coordination mechanisms, where appropriate.",
    "334": "We invite regional and subregional organizations, including regional economic communities and regional development banks, to mainstream the implementation of the Programme of Action into their relevant programmes.",
    "335": "We invite the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, as well as the high-level political forum on sustainable development, to devote adequate time to discussion of the sustainable development challenges facing the landlocked developing countries in order to enhance engagement and implement commitments.",

    "337": "The Secretary-General is requested to ensure the full mobilization of all relevant parts of the United Nations system to facilitate coordinated implementation and coherence in the follow-up to and monitoring of the Programme of Action at the national, subregional, regional and global levels.",
    "338": "The available coordination mechanisms, such as the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination and the United Nations Sustainable Development Group, should be broadly utilized and we call for the existing high-level United Nations coordination mechanisms to generate momentum and support for the Programme of Action in the system.",
    "339": "We acknowledge with appreciation the work of the Inter-Agency Consultative Group for Landlocked Developing Countries, led by the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, and call for its further strengthening.",
    "340": "We call for closer coordination between the Office of the High Representative and United Nations country teams in landlocked developing countries, as an important tool for follow-up to and review of the implementation of provisions of the Programme of Action. We also stress the critical importance of the more proactive role of United Nations agencies, including through the United Nations resident coordinators and country teams, in mobilizing all stakeholders to help Governments of landlocked developing countries to address the challenges caused by those countries\u2019 structural constraints. VI. Role of the Board of Advisers to the President of the General Assembly on Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States and the Group of Friends of Landlocked Developing Countries",

VIII. Network of national focal points",
    "344": " points designated by landlocked developing countries are heavily involved in the localization of the Vienna Programme of Action and the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as their national implementation, monitoring, review and reporting of the Programme of Action. We invite the Office of the High Representative to further strengthen the network of national focal points of landlocked developing countries and convene annual meetings of the focal points to share experiences and best practices on mainstreaming the new Programme of Action and the Sustainable Development Goals into national development processes, as well as their implementation and follow-up; network among peers; and better understand existing means of implementation, including viable financing and business models.",
    "345": "We commit to ensuring synergy and coherence between the implementation of the Programme of Action and the 2030 Agenda and other ongoing and upcoming processes. IX. Strengthening national statistical capacity",
    "346": "We recognize that high-quality, timely, relevant, disaggregated and reliable data will be needed to help with the measurement of progress and to ensure that no one is left behind. Such data are key to decision-making.",
    "347": "We note that national statistical institutions in landlocked developing countries remain underresourced, both financially and technically. The resulting scarcity of data and weak frameworks for monitoring and evaluation constrain the capacity for effective implementation and monitoring. The absence of robust reliable data also constrains the advocacy work to address the special circumstances of landlocked developing countries.",
    "348": "We commit to enhancing capacity-building support to developing countries, including for landlocked developing countries, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographical location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts. X. Undertaking thematic review and analytical work",
