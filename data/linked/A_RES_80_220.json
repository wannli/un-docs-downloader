    "2": "Expresses its very serious concern about: (a) Continuing reports of persistent violations of human rights, including the detailed findings made by the commission of inquiry in its report, by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in its ongoing monitoring and documentation work and by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, such as: (i) Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including inhuman conditions of detention; all forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including rape, in particular against women and girls; extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions; the imposition of the death penalty for political and religious reasons, which is now more widely allowed by law and implemented in practice; public executions; extrajudicial and arbitrary detention; the absence of fair trial guarantees and the rule of law, including an independent and corruption-free judiciary; and collective punishments extending up to three generations; (ii) The existence of an extensive penal system including political prison camps, re-education camps, labour training camps, labour training centres, detention centres, holding centres and waiting rooms, where a vast number of persons are deprived of their liberty and subjected to deplorable conditions, including forced labour, and where alarming violations of human rights are perpetrated; (iii) Enforced and involuntary disappearances of persons by arrest, detention or abduction against their will; refusal to disclose the fate and whereabouts of the persons concerned; and refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their liberty, which places them outside the protection of the law and which has inflicted severe suffering on them and their families; (iv) The forcible transfer of populations and the limitations imposed on persons wishing to move freely within the country or abroad, with even greater restrictions now compared to a decade ago, including harming or punishing those who leave or try to leave the country without permission, or their families; (v) The situation of refugees and asylum-seekers expelled or returned to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, including where the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea exerts pressure on returning States to effectuate such returns, and retaliation by the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea against its citizens who have been repatriated, including punishment by internment, torture, other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sexual and gender-based violence, or the death penalty, and in this regard strongly urges all Member States to respect the fundamental principle of non\u2011refoulement, to take action to counter acts of transnational repression by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, to treat humanely those who seek refuge and to ensure unhindered access to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and his Office, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, with a view to protecting the human rights of those who seek refuge, and to refrain from sharing information about the contacts and conduct of refugees, asylum-seekers and other citizens of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea with the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, and once again urges States Parties to comply with their obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees18 and the 1967 Protocol thereto19 in relation to refugees from the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea who are covered by those instruments, as well as under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment20 and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime; 21 (vi) All-pervasive and severe restrictions, including an absolute monopoly on information and total control over organized social life, further tightened by recent laws which provide for severe punishments, including the death penalty, namely the Law on Rejecting Reactionary Thought and Culture (2020), the Youth Education Guarantee Law (2021) and the Law on Protecting the Pyongyang Cultural Language (2023), on the rights to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and association, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, the right not to be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with individual privacy, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or imprisonment of individuals exercising their rights to freedom of opinion and expression and religion or belief, and the right of everyone, including women, to take part without unreasonable restriction in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives, of their country; (vii) Violations of economic, social and cultural rights, exacerbated by the continued border restrictions of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, which have led to food insecurity, severe hunger, malnutrition, widespread health problems and other hardship for the population in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea; (viii) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all women and girls, including unequal access to employment and discriminatory laws and regulations, domestic violence, as well as the creation of internal conditions that force women and girls to leave the country, making them extremely vulnerable to trafficking in persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation, forced labour, domestic servitude or forced marriage, and their subjection to sexual and gender-based discrimination and violence, including in the political and social spheres and by law enforcement officials, as well as throughout the entire penal system, including through forced abortions, invasive body cavity searches and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence; (ix) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of children, in particular the continued lack of access to basic economic, social and cultural rights for many children, and notes the particularly vulnerable situation faced by returned or repatriated children, children without housing, children with disabilities, children whose parents are detained, deceased or otherwise absent, children living in detention or in institutions and children in conflict with the law, and further notes with concern the reports of harsh and disproportionate punishment inflicted upon children; (x) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons with disabilities, especially violations involving the use of collective camps and coercive measures that target the rights of persons with disabilities to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and allegations of the possible use of persons with disabilities in medical testing, forced relocation to rural areas and separation of children with disabilities from their parents; (xi) Widespread use of forced labour, 22 which has become deeply institutionalized, and violations of workers\u2019 rights, including the right to freedom of association and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the right to strike as defined by the obligations of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the prohibition of the economic exploitation of children and of any harmful or hazardous work of children as defined by the obligations of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as the exploitation of workers sent abroad from the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to work under conditions that amount to forced labour, often for the purpose of generating income for the Government, and emphasizing the importance, in order to avoid any risk of Member States contributing to practices that may be inconsistent with international human rights standards, including those associated with reports of forced labour involving workers sent abroad by the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, of full implementation of the requirement that nationals of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea earning income overseas be repatriated, subject to applicable national and international law, as soon as possible pursuant to paragraph 8 of Security Council resolution 2397 (2017), the provision of final reports as soon as possible pursuant to the same resolution and the prohibition on providing work authorizations pursuant to paragraph 17 of resolution 2375 (2017), and urges the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to promote, respect and protect the human rights of workers, including workers repatriated to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea; (xii) Discrimination based on the songbun system, which classifies people on the basis of State-assigned social class and birth and also includes consideration of political opinions and religion, and the practice of guilt by association; (b) The continued refusal of the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to extend an invitation to the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, to engage and give consideration to the reports and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur, or to extend cooperation to the Special Rapporteur and several other United Nations special procedures, in accordance with their terms of reference, as well as to other United Nations human rights mechanisms; (c) The continued lack of acknowledgement by the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea of the grave human rights situation in the country and its consequential lack of action to report on the state of implementation of the recommendations contained in the outcome of its first, 23 second,24 third25 and fourth 26 universal periodic reviews and to give consideration to the concluding observations of the treaty bodies;",
