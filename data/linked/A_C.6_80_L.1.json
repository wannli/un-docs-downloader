It is expected that the Sixth Committee will include, in the forthcoming draft resolution to be prepared under the agenda item, an indication of the dates and number of meetings of the working group.

In the same resolution, the Assembly recommended that speakers should be mindful of the speed of statement delivery, bearing in mind the need for accuracy of interpretation. The delivery of national statements will be limited to 7 minutes, and group statements to 12 minutes, for all agenda items except those dealing with the annual report of the International Law Commission, for which delegations are encouraged to limit their statements to main positions and views for a total of 12 minutes (with further information or clarifications provided in written versions made available through the eStatements portal or in written submissions to the Commission).",
    "15": "In accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, delegations should exercise their right of reply at the end of the day whenever two meetings have been scheduled for the consideration of the relevant agenda item on that day, or at the conclusion of the consideration of the item, if that is sooner.

The Secretariat will provide assistance where necessary. Informal consultations should be announced sufficiently in advance, including in the Journal of the United Nations, so as to allow participation by representatives of all Member States. Once consultations have concluded, it is the practice of the Sixth Committee to place proposals for draft resolutions under a silence procedure, prior to their submission for processing and issuance in all official languages as limited (\u201cL\u201d) documents.",
    "18": "All delegations wishing to sponsor a proposal for a draft resolution, where applicable, are encouraged to do so electronically through the eSponsorship module, rather than during the formal proceedings of the Committee. This is without prejudice to the possibility of delegations sponsoring a proposal for a draft resolution at the time of the Committee\u2019s action on the latter during a plenary meeting. Sponsorship should take place at the level of the Sixth Committee, given that, once the Committee has adopted a proposal for a draft resolution and recommended its adoption by the General Assembly, its sponsorship can no longer be altered by Member States. Proposals for draft resolutions submitted on behalf of the Bureau are not subject to sponsorship.",
    "19": "Pursuant to rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, \u201cno resolution involving expenditure shall be recommended by a committee for approval by the General Assembly unless it is accompanied by an estimate of expenditures prepared by the Secretary-General\u201d. It is therefore imperative that the Sixth Committee allow sufficient time for the preparation of estimates of expenditure by the Secretariat and for their consideration by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth Committee. Bearing in mind that 21 November has been fixed as the concluding date for the work of the Sixth Committee (see para. 6), 7 November would have to be considered the mandatory deadline for submission to the Fifth Committee of draft resolutions with financial implications, except for draft resolutions concerning items to be considered after that date. When submitting such proposals, delegations may also wish to bear in mind that, in most cases, a period of more than 48 hours, up to four days, is required for the Secretary-General to review the programme budget implications of proposals. Accordingly, the deadline for finalization and submission of all draft resolutions for budget review and processing is 14 November 2025.",
    "20": "Each coordinator or main sponsor, as applicable, of proposals for draft resolutions will be invited to introduce their respective draft resolutions as issued in limited distribution (\u201cL\u201d) documents. Such introductions take place at plenary meetings, and will be announced in advance, including in the Journal.",
    "21": "Except for draft resolutions introduced at the final meeting of the substantive part of the session on 21 November 2025, it is the practice of the Committee to take action on each draft resolution at the plenary meeting following that at which the draft resolution was introduced, or at a later date. Any anticipated action on draft resolutions or decisions will be announced in advance, including in the Journal and on the website of the Committee. It is the practice of the Sixth Committee to strive for the adoption of draft resolutions without taking a vote. Conference resources available",
    "22": "The available conference facilities will, in principle, enable the Committee to hold between three and six plenary meetings per week. Morning meetings will be held from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and afternoon meetings from 3 to 6 p.m.",
    "23": "Unless otherwise specified, formal meetings of the Committee will be held from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 to 6 p.m. in the Trusteeship Council Chamber. The General Assembly has stressed that a punctual start to the meetings is critical to the efficient utilization of services allocated to the intergovernmental bodies of the United Nations. In accordance with past practice, rule 108 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly could be waived with respect to the quorum needed to declare a meeting open."
