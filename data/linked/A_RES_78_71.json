    "5": "Also notes with appreciation the implementation of the 2022 strategy to improve collection, analysis and dissemination of data on radiation exposure aimed at seeking widespread participation in the Scientific Committee\u2019s surveys and ensuring that future surveys adapt to changing data sources and use of radiation across the world;",
    "6": "Welcomes the continuation of the ad hoc working group on effects and mechanisms and the ad hoc working group on sources and exposure to assist the Scientific Committee in supporting and monitoring progress in the implementation of its programme of work, to evaluate new scientific developments relevant to the Committee, to implement the updated strategy for data collection and to work with the secretariat to continue the preparation of the future programme of work of the Committee for 2025 to 2029;",
    "7": "Supports the Scientific Committee in continuing to conduct its programme of work of scientific review and assessment on behalf of the General Assembly, welcomes progress, in particular its global survey and evaluation of public exposure to ionizing radiation, its epidemiological studies of radiation and cancer, and its evaluation of diseases of the circulatory system from radiation exposure, which are being conducted in close cooperation with other relevant organizations, and requests the Committee to submit plans for its ongoing and future programme of work to the Assembly at its seventy-ninth session;",
    "8": "Welcomes the progress of the ongoing evaluation on second primary cancer after radiotherapy, and emphasizes the importance of completing this evaluation at the earliest possible time;",
    "9": "Notes the initiation of the new evaluation on nervous system effects of ionizing radiation;",
    "10": "Requests the Scientific Committee to continue its work, including its important activities to increase knowledge of the levels, effects and risks of ionizing radiation from all sources, and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its seventy-ninth session;",
    "11": "Acknowledges the importance of sharing data with the Scientific Committee as appropriate and the central role played by the National Contact Persons in order to coordinate data collection at the country level and to cooperate with technical experts to complete the Committee\u2019s questionnaires;",

    "15": "Welcomes, in this context, the readiness of Member States to provide the Scientific Committee with relevant information on the levels and effects of ionizing radiation, and invites the Committee to analyse and give due consideration to such information, particularly in the light of its own findings;",
    "16": "Recalls the strategy of the Scientific Committee to improve data collection, encourages in this regard Member States, the organizations of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations concerned to provide further relevant data about levels, effects and risks of radiation exposure from various sources, which would greatly help in the preparation of future reports of the Committee to the General Assembly, and encourages the International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization and other relevant organizations to further collaborate with the secretariat on arrangements for the collection, analysis and dissemination of data on radiation exposures of patients, workers and the general public;",
    "17": "Notes the renewed framework for cooperation with the Information System on Occupational Exposure in December 2022 and the research agreement with the European Commission in June 2023;",
    "18": "Welcomes the use and ongoing development by the secretariat of an online platform for collecting data on the exposure of patients, workers and the general public, and urges Member States to take part in the Scientific Committee\u2019s global survey on public exposure and to nominate National Contact Persons to facilitate coordination of the collection and submission of data on the exposure of patients, workers and the general public within the country;",
    "19": "Also welcomes the Scientific Committee\u2019s outreach strategy for the period 2020\u20132024, in particular the enhancement of the website of the Committee and the planned publication of information for the general public in all the official languages of the United Nations, continues to encourage that consideration be given to publishing the website in all of those languages, and notes that the dissemination of the Committee\u2019s findings and further enhancements to the website would depend on the financial and human resources made available to the secretariat;",
