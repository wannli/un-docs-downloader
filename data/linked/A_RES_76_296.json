    "1": " the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, under the overarching theme, \u201cScaling up ocean action based on science and innovation for the implementation of Goal 14: stocktaking, partnerships and solutions\u201d, with the participation of civil society and other relevant stakeholders, reaffirm our strong commitment to conserve and sustainably use the ocean, seas and marine resources. Greater ambition is required at all levels to address the dire state of the ocean. As leaders and representatives of our Governments, we are determined to act decisively and urgently to improve the health, productivity, sustainable use and resilience of the ocean and its ecosystems.",
    "2": "We reaffirm the declaration entitled \u201cOur ocean, our future: call for action\u201d, adopted by the high-level United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development, held from 5 to 9 June 2017.",
    "3": "We recognize that the ocean is fundamental to life on our planet and to our future. The ocean is an important source of the planet\u2019s biodiversity and plays a vital role in the climate system and water cycle. The ocean provides a range of ecosystem services, supplies us with oxygen to breathe, contributes to food security, nutrition and decent jobs and livelihoods, acts as a sink and reservoir of greenhouse gases and protects biodiversity, provides a means for maritime transportation, including for global trade, forms an important part of our natural and cultural heritage and plays an essential role in sustainable development, a sustainable ocean-based economy and poverty eradication. We underline the interlinkages and potential synergies between Goal 14 and the other Sustainable Development Goals and recognize that the implementation of Goal 14 can contribute significantly to the realization of the 2030 Agenda, which is integrated and indivisible in its nature.",
    "4": "We are therefore deeply alarmed by the global emergency facing the ocean. Sea levels are rising, coastal erosion is worsening and the ocean is warmer and more acidic. Marine pollution is increasing at an alarming rate, a third of fish stocks are overexploited, marine biodiversity continues to decrease and approximately half of all living coral has been lost, while alien invasive species pose a significant threat to marine ecosystems and resources. While progress has been made towards the achievement of some of the targets of Goal 14, action is not advancing at the speed or scale required to meet our goals. We deeply regret our collective failure to achieve targets 14.2, 14.4, 14.5 and 14.6 that matured in 2020, and we renew our commitment to taking urgent action and to cooperating at the global, regional and subregional levels to achieve all targets as soon as possible without undue delay.",
    "5": "We reaffirm that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and we are deeply alarmed by the adverse effects of climate change on the ocean and marine life, including the rise in ocean temperatures, ocean acidification, deoxygenation, sea level rise, the decrease in polar ice coverage, shifts in the abundance and distribution of marine species, including fish, the decrease in marine biodiversity, as well as coastal erosion and extreme weather events and related impacts on island and coastal communities, as highlighted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its special report entitled The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate and its successive reports.",
    "6": " Agreement states that it will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. We also emphasize the need to adapt to the unavoidable effects of climate change. We reaffirm the importance of implementing the Glasgow Climate Pact on mitigation, adaptation and the provision and mobilization of finance, technology transfer and capacity-building to developing countries, including small island developing States. We welcome the decision by the parties to the Framework Convention to recognize the importance of protecting, conserving and restoring ecosystems, including marine ecosystems, to deliver crucial services, including acting as sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases, reducing vulnerability to climate change impacts and supporting sustainable livelihoods, including for indigenous peoples and local communities. We further welcome the invitation to relevant work programmes and constituted bodies under the Framework Convention to consider how to integrate and strengthen ocean-based action in relevant mandates and workplans and the invitation to the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice to hold an annual dialogue to strengthen ocean- based action.",
    "7": "We are deeply concerned by the findings about cumulative human impacts on the ocean, including ecosystem degradation and species extinctions, as highlighted in the second World Ocean Assessment and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, as well as on food safety and human health as recognized in the One Health approach. We recognize the need for transformative change and are committed to halting and reversing the decline in the health of the ocean\u2019s ecosystems and biodiversity and to protecting and restoring its resilience and ecological integrity. We call for an ambitious, balanced, practical, effective, robust and transformative post-2020 global biodiversity framework for adoption at the second part of the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. We take note of the voluntary commitments by more than 100 Member States to conserve or protect at least 30 per cent of the global ocean within marine protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures by 2030. We emphasize that strong governance and adequate financing for developing countries, in particular small island developing States, is essential to effectively implement and maintain such areas and measures. We also recognize the importance of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021\u20132030) and its call to support and scale up efforts to prevent, halt and reverse the degradation of ecosystems worldwide.",
    "8": "We welcome the decision by the United Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme at its resumed fifth session, in resolution 5/14 of 2 March 2022, to convene an intergovernmental negotiating committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, which could include both binding and voluntary approaches, based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastic, taking into account, among other things, the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, as well as national circumstances and capabilities.",
    "9": " affirm that the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and the advancement of nature-based solutions, ecosystem-based approaches play a critical role in ensuring a sustainable, inclusive and environmentally resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "10": "We emphasize that our actions to implement Goal 14 should be in accordance with, reinforce and not duplicate or undermine existing legal instruments, arrangements, processes, mechanisms or entities. We affirm the need to enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of \u201cThe future we want\u201d. We note that 2022 marks the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention.",
    "11": "We recognize the importance of the work being undertaken by the intergovernmental conference on an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction and call upon participating delegations to reach an ambitious agreement without delay.",
    "12": "We also recognize the importance of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021\u20132030) and its vision to achieve the science we need for the ocean we want. We support the Decade\u2019s mission to generate and use knowledge for the transformational action needed to achieve a healthy, safe and resilient ocean for sustainable development by 2030 and beyond. We fully support the work of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in implementing the Decade and commit to supporting these efforts.",
