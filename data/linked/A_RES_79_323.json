  "paragraphs": {
    "1": "We, the Heads of State and Government and High Representatives, have gathered in Sevilla, Spain, from 30 June to 3 July 2025 to renew the global financing for development framework, building on the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda. 1 We also uphold and will advance all commitments in the 2002 Monterrey Consensus,2 the 2008 Doha Declaration,3 as well as the relevant commitments in the Pact for the Future.4",
    "2": "We reaffirm our commitment to realize sustainable development, including effectively implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 5 and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals and upholding all principles enshrined in it. We also reaffirm that poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, remains the greatest global challenge and its eradication is an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. We recommit to end poverty and hunger everywhere, leaving no one behind.",
    "3": "We further reaffirm that the pursuit and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, encompassing civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, which includes the right to development, must be respected, protected and promoted, without distinction or discrimination of any kind.",
    "4": "We are meeting at a time of profound transformation, serious geopolitical tensions, conflicts, increasing macroeconomic challenges and growing systemic risks. Progress in achieving sustainable development in its economic, social and environmental dimensions is severely off track. We are running out of time to achieve our goals and to address the adverse impacts of climate change. Despite significant efforts by the international community to respond to recent multiple interlinked global challenges, the gap between our sustainable development aspirations and financing to meet them has continued to widen, particularly in developing countries, reaching an estimated 4 trillion United States dollars annually.",
    "5": "We cannot afford a retreat from multilateral cooperation. These global challenges far exceed the capacity of any single State to respond. To address them, we reaffirm our continued and strong commitment to multilateralism, international cooperation, and global solidarity based on mutual respect and collective action. We also reaffirm our unwavering commitment to international law, including the Charter of the United Nations.",
    "6": "We decide to launch an ambitious package of reforms and actions to close this financing gap with urgency and catalyse sustainable development investments at scale. We will take concrete actions to enhance fiscal space, address debt challenges of developing countries and lower the cost of capital. We will provide and mobilize additional, innovative, adequate, affordable, predictable and accessible financing from all sources, recognizing the comparative advantages of public and private finance.",
    "7": "We commit to continued reform of the international financial architecture, enhancing its resilience, coherence and effectiveness in responding to present and future challenges and crises. To better reflect today\u2019s realities, we commit to make global economic governance more inclusive, representative, equitable and effective. We will strengthen the roles of the United Nations, international financial institutions and other relevant international organizations, while recognizing their respective mandates and governance bodies. We will enhance coordination and complementarity among them.",
    "8": "We recognize that each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development. National development efforts need to be supported by an enabling international economic environment and effective means of implementation that promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, and prevent external shocks from disproportionately affecting developing countries. We commit to align international support with national strategies, plans and frameworks, such as integrated national financing frameworks, and will respect each country\u2019s policy space to pursue sustainable development while remaining consistent with relevant international rules and commitments.",
    "9": "We will address the diverse needs and challenges faced by countries in special situations, in particular African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, as well as the specific challenges faced by middle-income countries and countries in conflict and post- conflict situations. We reaffirm that least developed countries, as the most vulnerable group of countries, need enhanced global support to overcome the structural challenges they face for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We reaffirm the need to address the special challenges and needs of landlocked developing countries in structurally transforming their economies, harnessing benefits from international trade and developing efficient transport and transit systems. We further reaffirm that small island developing States remain a special case for sustainable development in view of their small size, remoteness, narrow resource and export base and exposure to global environmental challenges. We also reaffirm the need to achieve a positive socioeconomic transformation in Africa and the need to address the diverse and specific development needs of middle-income countries, including combating poverty in all of its forms and dimensions, including extreme and multidimensional poverty. We commit to support and implement the relevant development agendas, strategies and programmes of action for countries in special situations, including the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries,6 the Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024\u20132034 7 and the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States, 8 and reaffirm our support for the achievement of the African Union Agenda 2063. We look forward to the elaboration of a specific inter-agency, comprehensive, system-wide response plan for middle-income countries by the United Nations development system.",
    "10": "We will place people at the centre of all our actions and reaffirm the path to a brighter future for all of humanity. We will take action to combat inequalities within and among countries, including through investment in social protection systems and human development and through enhanced international cooperation.",
    "11": "We reaffirm the imperative of achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. We will ensure their full and equal enjoyment of all their human rights and fundamental freedoms. Gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls bring proven economic benefits and have the potential to contribute to financing for development. We commit to mainstream a gender perspective and promote gender-responsive solutions across the financing for development agenda. We recognize that the feminization of poverty persists, and the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is an indispensable requirement for women\u2019s economic empowerment and sustainable development. We will increase investment in the care economy and recognize, value and equitably redistribute the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work done by women. We reaffirm our commitment to eliminate gender-based violence.",
    "12": "We recognize that discrimination in all its forms is a serious impediment to economic and social development. We will step up our efforts to promote tolerance, embrace diversity and combat all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and all their abhorrent and contemporary forms and manifestations. We reaffirm the imperative of ensuring access to finance and economic opportunities for persons with disabilities.",
    "13": "We commit to develop effective, accountable and inclusive governance systems and democratic institutions at the subnational, national and international levels and ensure responsive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels. We will foster transparency, accountability, the rule of law, good governance and sound policies at all levels. We commit to eradicate all forms of corruption at all levels, address financial integrity and integrate anti\u2011corruption as cross-cutting issues to enhance public sector integrity and public trust, reduce inequalities, ensure fair domestic resource allocation and increase private investments and economic growth. We will prevent and combat illicit financial flows and corruption, and call upon the international community to support anti\u2011corruption capacity-building efforts and promote the exchange of best practices.",
    "14": "We reaffirm our determination to foster peaceful, just and inclusive societies which are free from fear and violence. There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development.",
    "15": "We are falling short in tackling climate change, biodiversity loss and desertification. We stress the urgency of enhancing ambition for climate action in the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 9 and the Paris Agreement 10 in relation to climate mitigation, adaptation and the provision of the means of implementation, especially finance, to developing countries. We recognize the Convention on Biological Diversity, 11 the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification12 and the Conferences of the Parties thereto, for negotiating global responses to the challenges they address. In pursuit of the objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the goals of the Paris Agreement, we reaffirm the importance of accelerating action in this critical decade. We will promote the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its resources.",
    "16": "We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 13 including, inter alia, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, as set out in principle 7 thereof.",
    "17": "We commit to scale up investment in disaster risk reduction and disaster risk financing to safeguard development gains from disasters. We will promote risk- informed investment to develop the infrastructure for sustainable development in alignment with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030. 14 Disasters and shocks are increasingly hampering developing countries\u2019 abilities to make progress toward sustainable development, reversing development gains, and stretching national capabilities and the international system\u2019s ability to respond.",
    "18": "We encourage efforts to address food insecurity and malnutrition and invest in agrifood systems, particularly in developing countries, using a long-term, strategic approach. We emphasize the need to develop an enabling policy environment which facilitates private investment in agriculture and food systems, and the role that public investments can play in incentivizing and derisking private investments.",
    "19": "We reaffirm our commitments to increase investment in universal health coverage and inclusive, equitable, affordable, resilient and quality health systems.",
    "20": "We commit to support adequate financing to ensure inclusive, equitable and quality education for all. We will take action to leverage the positive impacts of digitalization in education and reaffirm our commitment to foster innovation, financial literacy and digital capacity-building, including through education and skills development, particularly for children, youth and older persons.",
    "21": "We will invest in productive sectors, the creation of decent jobs at scale and skills development to enable all people to benefit from inclusive, equitable and sustainable economic growth. We will promote entrepreneurship, including social entrepreneurship, particularly among women and youth, and facilitate the growth of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, cooperatives and the social and solidarity economy, as well as inclusive and sustainable industrialization. We recognize the contribution of culture and creative economy to advance sustainable development.",
    "22": "We commit to support developing countries, particularly countries in special situations, to develop quality, reliable, resilient and sustainable infrastructure. Closing the significant infrastructure gap in critical sectors, such as energy, transport, information and communications technologies, water and sanitation will greatly improve access to essential services, employment opportunities, economic growth and sustainable development.",
    "23": "We recognize that high-quality and disaggregated data and statistics enable evidence-based policy decisions and enhance accountability and transparency, fostering public trust and international cooperation. We will support programmes that strengthen national data collection and statistics, especially on sustainable development.",
    "24": "We recognize the contributions of multi-stakeholder engagement to sustainable development. We will continue to collaborate meaningfully with all relevant stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, and encourage multi- stakeholder collaboration and partnerships.",
    "25": "This renewed global framework for financing for development that we adopt in Sevilla will improve access to and unlock additional and innovative financial resources, support the reform of the international financial architecture to close the financing gap with urgency, and guide our efforts towards a financing for development agenda that will help to realize sustainable development. II. Action areas A. Domestic public resources",
    "26": " tax revenue increases in many developing countries in the first decade of the twenty- first century, recent years have seen stagnation and setbacks, amid weak global economic growth. Additionally, existing international tax rules often do not fully respond to the diverse needs, priorities and capacities of developing countries, especially the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, African countries and small island developing States, as well as middle-income countries. Mobilizing additional domestic public resources and ensuring their effective and efficient use for sustainable development impact will require decisive national action to strengthen fiscal systems, promote their progressivity, build long-term financial resilience and align them with sustainable development, including through the use of data and statistics to inform decisions. In a globalized and increasingly digitalized world, domestic efforts must be complemented by international cooperation, including through inclusive and effective international tax cooperation, improved capacity to collect revenues and robust measures to prevent and combat tax evasion, illicit financial flows and corruption. National and public development banks also have a crucial role in mobilizing investments for sustainable development. We reaffirm that national sovereignty will be fully respected, and each country has the right to choose its own national priorities and policies according to its circumstances.",
    "27": " international cooperation, while respecting national sovereignty. Subnational finance (o) We will strengthen subnational finance, where appropriate, by enhancing local and regional authorities\u2019 technical, technological and human resource capacities, improving accounting systems and reporting mechanisms, and boosting intergovernmental coordination. We will also promote the diversification of revenue and financing sources, including exploring the development of municipal bond markets as applicable, and promoting stable and transparent intergovernmental financial transfer systems and equalization mechanisms; (p) We will support national and local governments to prioritize and strengthen their policies, strategies and practices to implement effective infrastructure asset management and development over the life cycle of assets and mobilize revenues as appropriate.",
    "28": " information exchange among national beneficial ownership registries and consider the feasibility and utility of a global beneficial ownership registry. In all these efforts, we will build on existing work, facilitate the exchange of knowledge and best practices, and provide assistance to developing countries in implementing these transparency standards; (h) We will provide developing countries with demand-based technical assistance and capacity-building programmes to ensure that they benefit from international tax cooperation.",
    "29": "To overcome the substantial and persistent challenges for effectively combating illicit financial flows: (a) We commit to effectively regulate professional service providers, as appropriate, at the national level and enhance international cooperation to curb illicit financial flows and other illicit financial activities. Building on existing standards, we will promote global discussions on standardizing regulatory regimes of professional service providers involved in illicit financial flows; (b) We will support the role that the media and civil society play in fairly, transparently and ethically exposing illicit financial flows; (c) We will establish a special meeting of the Economic and Social Council on financial integrity to foster dialogue on financial integrity at a systemic level, discuss unintended consequences of financial integrity policies, and exchange best practices, including on the use of technologies to effectively combat illicit financial flows; (d) We commit to full and effective implementation and enforcement of existing obligations under the United Nations Convention against Corruption, 15 including by supporting a transparent, inclusive and efficient Mechanism for the Review of Implementation of the Convention to assist States Parties to the Convention in preventing and combating corruption. Furthermore, we commit to scale up technical assistance and exchange of best practices for the implementation of the Convention upon request; (e) We commit to ensure that assets confiscated pursuant to the United Nations Convention against Corruption are returned to countries of origin, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, and are used transparently. We resolve to further enhance practices for asset recovery and return through strengthened international cooperation \u2013 underlining the importance of addressing, tackling and effectively responding to international challenges and barriers, in particular measures, that hinder such cooperation \u2013 capacity-building initiatives and exchange of expertise, and to improve efficiency of asset recovery and return, including through the biennial international expert meetings on asset return and the 2030 Agenda (Addis process). We will foster pilot initiatives for new and innovative approaches that support sustainable development; (f) We will strengthen international cooperation in asset recovery, including through the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative, a joint initiative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the World Bank; (g) We will identify, assess and act on money-laundering risks, including through effective implementation of the Financial Action Task Force standards on anti\u2011money-laundering/countering the financing of terrorism. We encourage the Financial Action Task Force to continue to mitigate unintended consequences of anti\u2011money-laundering/countering the financing of terrorism measures and ensure meaningful inclusion of developing countries in its decision-making processes, to ensure that their voices are heard and that the work and processes of the Financial Action Task Force take into account the unique contexts and capacities of developing countries; (h) We will promote measures to eliminate safe havens, aggressive tax practices, and loopholes that create incentives for illicit financial flows. We commit to take effective steps to prevent illicit financial flows from entering our jurisdictions; (i) We will strengthen the capacity of customs administrations for the detection of illicit financial flows at the borders; (j) We will enhance accurate and timely trade data exchange, as appropriate, to address smuggling of commercial goods and trade misinvoicing, including by supporting developing countries to upgrade technology in their ports.",
    "30": "To fully exploit the potential of national public development banks in mobilizing resources for sustainable development and address challenges that limit their efficiency and effectiveness: (a) We encourage countries with national development banks to reinforce their capacities to effectively contribute to sustainable development, as appropriate, including by leveraging resources from multilateral development banks and other investors; to review and update their mandates to align with sustainable development, as appropriate; and to establish or maintain social and environmental safeguards systems when needed. We commit to provide support to countries without development banks to establish such institutions to address local and national development challenges; (b) We encourage multilateral development banks and development partners to enhance financial and technical support to national public development banks in their efforts to provide long-term low-cost financing to invest in sustainable development. We also encourage multilateral development banks and other development institutions to work as a system through enhanced cooperation and coordination with national development banks, in support of national priorities and plans; (c) We will enhance alignment between national regulatory requirements and national development banks\u2019 development-focused mandates to promote distinctive business models and risk profiles, ensuring that development banks are empowered to pursue innovative and risk-informed approaches to financing sustainable development while maintaining financial sustainability. B. Domestic and international private business and finance",
    "31": " at all levels for long-term quality investment in sustainable development and to ensure that additional private resources are mobilized at scale and speed for developing countries.",
    "32": " (i) increased digitalization for developing countries in need, especially small island developing States, building on existing global efforts.",
    "33": " capital to de-risk investments and change the risk profile of early-stage markets in countries in special situations, creating the conditions for subsequent crowding-in of the private sector with scaled-up financing through development finance institutions and multilateral development banks; (n) We encourage private sector arms of multilateral development banks to expand local currency lending and enhance private equity, venture capital and microfinance ecosystems, where appropriate; (o) We encourage multilateral development banks to establish pools of catalytic capital seeded by development banks, development finance institutions and development partners, including foundations and philanthropies, with standardized, simplified and transparent access requirements. We support the development of repositories of guarantee instruments, building on the World Bank Guarantee Platform. We also invite the multilateral development banks to continue to explore the use of innovative financial instruments such as portfolio guarantee platforms; (p) We will work with multilateral development banks, development finance institutions and the private sector to support the development of cost-effective, long- term foreign exchange risk mitigation and hedging solutions for investments in sustainable development; (q) We will support the work of relevant stakeholders, including standard- setting bodies, to ensure that the risk reduction stemming from the use of State- and multilateral development bank-guaranteed financing is fairly valued in regulatory analysis and credit assessments; (r) We commit to further improve the availability, quality and accessibility of risk and impact data to support additional investments in developing countries, including by working with institutional investors. We encourage the continued release of quality disaggregated data, including from the Global Emerging Markets Risk Database Consortium. We encourage the sharing and publishing of financial performance data of blended finance transactions and private sector mobilization rates in an aggregated and anonymized way; (s) We will strengthen efforts to facilitate diaspora investment, including through innovative instruments, and call upon development partners to support such efforts, including by engaging with diaspora communities and national Governments; (t) We recognize the role of official export credit agencies in providing export credit insurance, untied guarantee activities, and working capital financing. We encourage greater cooperation and alignment between export credit agencies, multilateral development banks and other financial actors to enhance the efficiency and impact of public capital, particularly in the light of increasing financial constraints.",
    "34": " (b) private entities and developing countries, while respecting existing national frameworks. We will leverage existing efforts for the interoperability of taxonomies, towards a set of common design principles as guidance for local implementation, taking into account national circumstances and development priorities. C. International development cooperation and development effectiveness",
    "35": "International development cooperation, including official development assistance, continues to make a significant contribution to implementing the 2030 Agenda and realizing sustainable development in its three dimensions. Recent shifts and reductions of official development assistance amid changing political priorities have put development cooperation under stress, with official development assistance commitments still falling short. South-South cooperation is a complement to, not a substitute for, North-South cooperation, and has been expanding, as has triangular cooperation. Multilateral development banks, which are in a unique position to accelerate financing for sustainable development and to leverage shareholder contribution through their balance sheets, have taken significant steps to expand their financial capacity, enhance their development impact and address global challenges. But overall, development cooperation has not kept pace with rising and evolving needs of developing countries, especially in countries in special situations, as well as countries in conflict and post-conflict situations. Persistent poverty and inequality, food insecurity, disasters, adverse impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation and other challenges are increasing demands on limited resources. Addressing growing fragmentation and lack of coordination is essential to respond to increasing transaction costs and uphold long-standing effectiveness principles. International development cooperation needs to reinforce developing countries\u2019 capacities to achieve sustainable development, and address poverty eradication and hunger, catalyse the mobilization of other sources of finance, both public and private, and support countries to better manage transitions throughout their development process. This requires reinvigorating the development cooperation architecture \u2013 globally and in countries \u2013 as a basis for a more effective, inclusive, coherent and efficient cooperation and partnership that honours existing commitments, meets and adapts to emerging needs, prioritizes country leadership and local ownership, promotes transparency and mutual accountability, and focuses on sustainable development impact.",
    "36": " frames for achieving official development assistance targets. We call upon others to do the same regarding their respective official development assistance commitments; (d) We urge developed countries to increase official development assistance programmed at the country level and aligned with the sustainable development priorities of recipient countries, including by potentially increasing budget support in official development assistance. We also recognize the value of using flexible programming modalities, where appropriate, that enhance country ownership, effectiveness and transparency. We recognize the importance of grant-based or highly concessional finance and non\u2011debt creating instruments for developing countries, and will explore increasing the share of grants in official development assistance. We encourage loans to be accompanied by complementary support, such as grants, technical assistance and skills transfer. We will also explore opportunities to mobilize additional finance, both public and private, through official development assistance- funded activities that are responsive to country needs and focused on long-term development and poverty eradication, while ensuring that additional private finance mobilized is not a substitute for existing commitments; South-South and triangular cooperation (e) We welcome the efforts and contributions of developing countries in providing finance for sustainable development and encourage them to scale up their voluntary contributions and support; (f) We commit to enhance the impact and effectiveness of South-South cooperation, guided by the principles of respect for national sovereignty, national ownership and independence, equality, non\u2011conditionality, non\u2011interference in domestic affairs and mutual benefit; (g) We commit to enhance triangular cooperation by fostering deeper collaboration and partnerships, ensuring knowledge exchange, aligning efforts with the Sustainable Development Goals, and leveraging innovative financing mechanisms to enhance its sustainability and impact; (h) We will strengthen regional financing mechanisms that facilitate cross- border investment, resource mobilization and knowledge-sharing among developing countries. Strengthening these mechanisms will help to ensure that South-South cooperation is more sustainable, demand-driven and aligned with national development priorities.",

    "38": "To improve development cooperation and access to development finance, including concessional finance: (a) We reiterate the invitation made in the Pact for the Future for multilateral development banks, in consultation with the Secretary-General, to present options and recommendations on new approaches to improve access to concessional finance for developing countries, including projects with positive externalities in middle-income countries; (b) We will consider using complementary measures of progress that go beyond gross domestic product as a complement to existing policies and practices. These measures should reflect progress on the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, including in the consideration of informing access to development finance and technical cooperation, to ensure an inclusive approach to international cooperation; (c) We invite international financial institutions, multilateral development banks and international organizations to consider the use of the multidimensional vulnerability index, as a complement to their existing practices and policies, to inform their development cooperation policies and practices; (d) We commit to provide support for countries graduating to higher income per capita status, particularly countries that are highly vulnerable to shocks and disasters, to avoid disruptions in development trajectories, including by making efforts to avoid abrupt reductions in concessional and non\u2011concessional official finance, developing strategies that take into account pre\u2011graduation and post- graduation needs and facilitate tailored, coherent and integrated approaches to financing and integrating these into national development strategies.",

    "40": " (b) We support the United Nations in playing a central and coordinating role in international development cooperation; (c) We emphasize the importance of the precise measurement of official development assistance to ensure credible and reliable reporting for informed decision-making, resource allocation, progress monitoring and transparency in the reporting of development assistance. We recognize the need for inclusive multilateral dialogue on parameters and objectives of international development cooperation; (d) We will foster synergies across existing platforms and forums, including through a revitalized Development Cooperation Forum that deepens exchanges among and between all relevant actors to promote global knowledge-sharing and learning; enhance coherence, effectiveness, accountability and impact of development cooperation; and give policy guidance and recommendations, including by drawing on country reporting of data on Sustainable Development Goal indicator 17.3.1 as agreed by the Statistical Commission. Through the revitalized Development Cooperation Forum, we: (i) Will take into account the work of other relevant platforms, such as the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation mechanism and its forums, in supporting global knowledge-sharing and learning in a complementary manner; (ii) Look forward to the review process of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and invite them to provide updates to Member States and receive feedback on their review process; (iii) Take note of the work of the International Forum on Total Official Support for Sustainable Development on cross-border flows and we reaffirm that any such measure will not dilute commitments already made; (iv) Also take note of the work of the International Aid Transparency Initiative in fostering transparency of development cooperation.",
    "41": "To protect and preserve our ecosystems: (a) We acknowledge the importance of climate and environmental funds and will strive to enhance their alignment with national needs and priorities as well as complementarity and coherence between them, simplify access for developing countries, and strengthen cooperation with multilateral development banks and national development institutions; (b) We call for the provision and mobilization of means of implementation in line with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 16 and the Paris Agreement,17 including but not limited to the decisions on the new collective quantified goal on climate finance agreed in Baku, the Fund for responding to Loss and Damage, the Adaptation Fund, the Green Climate Fund, the Global Environment Facility, the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund, as well as support for the implementation of nationally determined contributions and national adaptation plans. We look forward to the launch of the \u201cBaku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T\u201d. We also stress the importance of transparency in climate finance reporting; (c) We call for the swift, full and effective implementation of the Kunming- Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework 18 under the Convention on Biological Diversity and emphasize the importance of urgently increasing financial resources from all sources. We welcome the establishment and operationalization of the Global Biodiversity Framework Fund as well as the launch of the Cali Fund for the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits from the Use of Digital Sequence Information on Genetic Resources. We look forward to establishing the permanent arrangement for the financial mechanism envisioned under article 21 of the Convention on Biological Diversity and assessing and improving the mobilization of finance from all sources to address the global biodiversity finance gap by 2030. In this regard, we call upon Parties to the Convention to deliver on the milestones envisioned in previous outcomes without delay; (d) We encourage developed country Parties to the Convention to Combat Desertification and other relevant stakeholders to actively support the efforts of developing country Parties to the Convention in promoting sustainable land management practices and in seeking to achieve a land degradation-neutral world by providing substantial financial resources from all sources, facilitated access to appropriate technology on mutually agreed terms and other forms of support, including through capacity-building measures; (e) We recognize that accelerating ocean action globally requires significant and accessible finance as well as adequate and scaled-up means of implementation for developing countries.

International trade as an engine for development",
    "42": "International trade is an engine for inclusive growth and poverty eradication and contributes to the promotion of sustainable development. Yet, the multilateral trading system is increasingly under threat. Trade restrictions, including tariffs inconsistent with World Trade Organization rules, principles and commitments, are on the rise globally amid rising trade tensions and stalling multilateral negotiations. Developing countries, including African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States and middle-income countries, with limited productive capacities and trade infrastructure, face challenges in integrating into regional and global value chains. This calls for concrete measures to improve their capacities to trade in goods and services and generate higher value addition in commodities and critical minerals, among other sectors, including through leveraging digital technologies, with a focus on the furthest behind. We take note that local currencies are used in cross-border payments, including for trade and investment, and that this can contribute to reducing vulnerabilities. While digital technology is creating new trading opportunities, development models reliant on the export of low-cost manufactured goods are impacted by automation. A universal, rules-based, fair, open, transparent, predictable, inclusive, non\u2011discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system should contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in all three dimensions, providing policy space for national development objectives, poverty eradication and sustainable development, while remaining consistent with relevant international rules and countries\u2019 commitments.",

F. International financial architecture and systemic issues",
    "52": "From Monterrey to Sevilla, we have emphasized the importance of continuing to reform global economic governance and strengthen the United Nations leadership role in promoting development to arrive at a stronger, more coherent and more inclusive international economic and financial architecture. The international financial architecture \u2013 the existing set of international financial frameworks, rules, institutions and markets that safeguard the stability and function of the global monetary and financial systems \u2013 fundamentally shapes sustainable development outcomes. International economic and financial institutions have made significant efforts towards institutional reform, including to preserve macroeconomic stability amid major shocks, address growing financing challenges faced by developing countries, and bring the architecture into greater alignment with sustainable development. But major systemic challenges persist. With full respect for the respective mandates and governance bodies of different international institutions, additional measures are needed to ensure that governance arrangements accurately reflect the diversity and complexity of the world; the global financial safety net has sufficient depth and coverage; financial regulatory frameworks effectively address existing and new risks and financial innovations; and private credit ratings effectively perform the important function of providing accurate and long-term-oriented information to financial markets. The international community must work together to broaden and enhance the voice and representation of developing countries in international financial and economic institutions. The international financial architecture must continuously adapt to changing global realities, align with sustainable development, and respond to the needs, evolving challenges and vulnerabilities facing all countries, especially developing countries.",

Technological advances can also have unintended economic, environmental and social impacts, and worsen gender inequality and the exclusion of persons with disabilities, older persons and those in vulnerable situations. We recognize the importance of enabling environments at all levels, including enabling regulatory and governance frameworks, in nurturing science, innovation and the dissemination of technologies. We support the development and deployment of new and existing technologies and products that are affordable, available, equitable and accessible to all, while ensuring that the development of emerging technologies is good for all. Coordinated national and international efforts are needed to leverage scientific and technological advances for sustainable development, close digital divides and realize the full potential of digital technology and the use of data in achieving financial inclusion and financial health.

However, many Member States, in particular developing countries, have not been able to fully capitalize on the power of data. Stronger efforts are needed to enhance disaggregated data, accessibility and innovative data sources, with adequate safeguards to address privacy and data protection. Political momentum is also growing for measuring progress in sustainable development using metrics that complement or go beyond gross domestic product, including multidimensional vulnerability. This reflects a broader recognition that relying solely on economic or income-based indicators such as gross domestic product and gross national income fails to capture the full complexity of countries\u2019 development realities, structural vulnerabilities and needs. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda strengthened the financing for development follow-up process; however, challenges remain.
