all forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including rape, in particular against women and girls; public executions; extrajudicial and arbitrary detention; the absence of due process and the rule of law, including fair trial guarantees and an independent judiciary; extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions; the imposition of the death penalty for political and religious reasons; collective punishments extending up to three generations; and the extensive use of forced labour, including of children; (ii) The existence of an extensive system of political prison camps, where a vast number of persons are deprived of their liberty and subjected to deplorable conditions, including forced labour, and where alarming violations of human rights are perpetrated; (iii) Enforced and involuntary disappearances of persons by arrest, detention or abduction against their will; refusal to disclose the fate and whereabouts of the persons concerned; and refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their liberty, which places such persons subjected thereto outside the protection of the law and which has had the effect of inflicting severe suffering on them and their families; (iv) The forcible transfer of populations and the limitations imposed on persons wishing to move freely within the country and travel abroad, including harming or punishing those who leave or try to leave the country without permission, or their families, as well as punishment of persons who are returned; (v) The situation of refugees and asylum seekers expelled or returned to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, including where the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea exerts pressure on returning States to effectuate such returns, and retaliations against citizens of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea who have been repatriated from abroad, leading to punishments of internment, torture, other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sexual and gender-based violence or the death penalty, and in this regard strongly urges all States to respect the fundamental principle of non-refoulement, to treat those who seek refuge humanely and to ensure unhindered access to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and his Office, with a view to protecting the human rights of those who seek refuge, and once again urges States parties to comply with their obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees16 and the 1967 Protocol thereto17 in relation to refugees from the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea who are covered by those instruments;

(vii) Violations of economic, social and cultural rights, exacerbated by the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the continued closure by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea of its borders, which have led to food insecurity, severe hunger, malnutrition, widespread health problems and other hardship for the population in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, in particular for women, children, persons with disabilities, older persons and political prisoners; (viii) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, in particular the creation of internal conditions that force women and girls to leave the country and make them extremely vulnerable to trafficking in persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation, forced labour, domestic servitude or forced marriage and the subjection of women and girls to sexual and gender- based discrimination, including in the political and social spheres, as well as in detention, forced abortions and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence;

(x) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons with disabilities, especially violations involving the use of collective camps and coercive measures that target the rights of persons with disabilities to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and allegations of the possible use of persons with disabilities in medical testing, forced relocation to rural areas and separation of children with disabilities from their parents; (xi) Violations of workers\u2019 rights, including the right to freedom of association and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the right to strike as defined by the obligations of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the prohibition of the economic exploitation of children and of any harmful or hazardous work of children as defined by the obligations of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as the exploitation of workers sent abroad from the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to work under conditions that reportedly amount to forced labour, and emphasizing in this context the importance of the full implementation of the requirement that nationals of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea earning income overseas be repatriated, subject to applicable national and international law, as soon as possible pursuant to paragraph 8 of Security Council resolution 2397 (2017), the provision of final reports as soon as possible pursuant to the same and the prohibition on providing work authorizations pursuant to paragraph 17 of resolution 2375 (2017), and urges the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to promote, respect and protect the human rights of workers, including workers repatriated to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea;
