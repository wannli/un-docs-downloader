    "2": "Underlines the importance of unlocking the benefits of natural plant fibres, and encourages all stakeholders to promote the sustainable production and use of natural plant fibres in all relevant areas and sectors;",
    "3": "Recognizes that the production, processing, application and proper management and export of natural plant fibres may well have the potential to be advantageous to the economies of many developing countries and the livelihoods of millions of small-scale farmers and low-wage workers, and in this regard calls upon Member States to take effective measures, as appropriate, to help to integrate small- scale holders into global production, value and supply chains for the sustainable production and use of natural plant fibres;",
    "4": "Stresses that the sustainable production and use of natural plant fibres may contribute to broader efforts towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as of outcome documents of other related major United Nations conferences and summits and multilateral environmental agreements, including the Paris Agreement and the achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets;11",
    "5": "Encourages Member States: (a) To foster political support, the mobilization of resources, capacity- building and proper management and momentum for the sustainable production and use of natural plant fibres at the global, regional, national and local levels, as appropriate; (b) To promote and support the full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, in particular indigenous peoples and local communities, in the decision- making process regarding the production of natural plant fibres; (c) To promote and support measures to ensure that the production of natural plant fibres is consistent with the conservation of natural forests and biological diversity and does not lead to the conversion of natural forests or overexploitation of natural resources, including water; (d) To consider mainstreaming the promotion of the sustainable production and use of natural plant fibres into policies and plans and current national development priorities, as appropriate, and address challenges, including environmental degradation and the adverse impacts of climate change; (e) To develop and implement policies and plans to incentivize the sustainable production and use of natural plant fibres and to promote the identification and development of environmentally friendly alternatives to single-use plastic products, taking into account the full life-cycle implications of those alternatives, so as to reduce the utilization of single-use plastic, in line with national laws and priorities, as appropriate; (f) To build on and reinforce existing initiatives in order to scale up the sustainable production and use of natural plant fibres, as appropriate; (g) To facilitate synergies among all stakeholders, including the private sector, civil society and academia, and a holistic view of how to promote international partnerships and achieve national priorities related to the promotion of the sustainable production and use of natural plant fibres, as appropriate; (h) To share information and best practices, in particular leveraging the platforms of South-South and triangular cooperation, regarding the multitude of innovative applications of natural plant fibres, with a view to promoting longer-term economic, social and environmental benefits for both producers and consumers; (i) To foster scientific research and development and cooperation at the national, regional and global levels, as appropriate, to support, in addition to traditional use, high-end, value-added and innovative use of natural plant fibres; (j) To preserve indigenous knowledge and technologies associated with natural plant fibres, and scale up their sustainable production and use, as appropriate;",
    "6": "Invites the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to lead the efforts and work with other United Nations entities, including the United Nations Environment Programme, to scale up international efforts to promote the sustainable production and use of natural plant fibres, within their respective mandates and existing resources, and through voluntary contributions, as appropriate;",
