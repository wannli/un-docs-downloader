    "1": "Renew and reaffirm our collective commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,3 including the resolve to end the tuberculosis epidemic by 2030, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 3.3, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development 4 and the 2018 political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the fight against tuberculosis;",
    "2": "Acknowledge that Millennium Development Goal 6 and associated strategies, plans and programmes for the prevention and care of tuberculosis helped to reverse the trend of the tuberculosis epidemic;",
    "3": "Reaffirm the political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on antimicrobial resistance, 5 the political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on HIV and AIDS,6 the political declaration of the third high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases,7 and the political declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage;8",
    "4": "Recall the first World Health Organization Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Tuberculosis in the Sustainable Development Era: A Multisectoral Response, held in Moscow on 16 and 17 November 2017, and its Moscow Declaration to End TB;",
    "5": "Reaffirm the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that the fulfilment of the right to health in the context of tuberculosis is closely linked to the right to enjoy and share the benefits of scientific progress and its applications, and note with concern that access to tuberculosis services and to the benefits of research and innovation such as quality, safe, efficacious and affordable tuberculosis diagnostics and treatment, remains challenging, especially for developing countries;",
    "6": "Reaffirm further that health is a precondition for, and an outcome and indicator of the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and that sustainable development can be achieved only in the absence of a high prevalence of debilitating diseases such as tuberculosis, which requires further multifaceted efforts, including to support developing countries, especially those with a high burden of tuberculosis to ensure they are on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, especially in light of the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;",
    "7": "Remain deeply concerned that while it has been 30 years since the World Health Organization declared tuberculosis a global emergency, the global tuberculosis epidemic still is a critical challenge in all regions and affects every country of the world and disproportionately affects developing countries, and that although tuberculosis is preventable and curable, an estimated 10.6 million people fell ill with tuberculosis, of whom 56.5 per cent were men, 32.5 per cent women and 11 per cent children, and approximately 1.6 million people died from the disease in 2021, including approximately 187,000 people with HIV, making tuberculosis one of the leading causes of death worldwide, that 30 high-tuberculosis-burden countries accounted for 87 per cent of those affected, and that one quarter of the world\u2019s population is estimated to have been infected with the bacterium that causes the disease and that millions of people ill with tuberculosis are missing out on quality care each year, including on access to affordable diagnostic tests and treatment, especially in developing countries;",
    "8": "Recognize that tuberculosis affects populations inequitably and contributes to the cycle of ill health and poverty, that malnutrition and inadequate living conditions contribute to the spread of tuberculosis and its impact upon the community, and that tuberculosis is fundamentally linked to a majority of the leading development challenges addressed by the 2030 Agenda;",
    "9": "Recognize that tuberculosis disproportionately affects people in vulnerable situations in all countries, that the epidemic is driven by both health and social and economic determinants, such as poverty, undernutrition, HIV, housing conditions, mental health, diabetes, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol and other substance abuse, including drug injection, incarceration, history of incarceration and other congregated settings, as well as occupational risks, such as among miners and health-care workers, that people with tuberculosis and their families face financial hardships before, during and after seeking care, and that these determinants and socioeconomic consequences of tuberculosis are exacerbated by or arise through health and humanitarian emergencies, armed conflicts, displacement, climate change and disasters, and therefore affirm that the response to tuberculosis needs to be people-centred, community-based, gender-responsive, with full respect for human rights, and integrated across relevant health and other sectors;",
    "10": "Recognize that structural inequity, stigma, racism and discrimination, including against women, inadequate investment in, and inequitable access to tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis, treatment remain key roadblocks to ending the tuberculosis epidemic, that people with tuberculosis may suffer from stigma and all forms of discrimination and that barriers to the enjoyment of human rights need to be addressed through comprehensive political, legal and programmatic actions;",
    "11": "Note the multidirectional relationship between tuberculosis, mental health conditions, social and economic determinants, including stigma and discrimination, that can lead to greater morbidity and poorer treatment outcomes, that the prevalence of depression is as high as 45 per cent among individuals with tuberculosis, and that this needs to be addressed through integrated programming;",
    "12": " well as psychosocial, nutritional and socioeconomic support for successful treatment, including to reduce stigma and discrimination;",
    "13": "Acknowledge that strong and resilient public health systems are an essential pillar of the tuberculosis response, including health workforce capacity- building for public and private sector care, and recognizes that women health workers make up 70 per cent of the global health workforce and 90 per cent of the front-line health workforce, but hold only 25 per cent of senior leadership positions in health, and resolve to address the 24 per cent pay gap compared to men across the health sector, and to provide better opportunities and working environments for women to ensure their role and leadership in the health sector;",
    "14": "Also acknowledge that investments in building robust, integrated and resilient health systems, including in tuberculosis prevention, detection and treatment services and research and development infrastructure and community responses can advance universal health coverage and contribute to effective pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, and recognizing the opportunity for further coordination for global health policies that the 2023 health-related General Assembly high-level meetings present;",
    "15": "Recognize that tuberculosis can cause infertility, maternal and perinatal mortality, that tuberculosis treatment can reduce obstetric complications, and that addressing this requires universal access to integrated tuberculosis care for women and girls across the life course, in order to obtain the highest standard of health, and that these must not be interrupted in times of emergency;",
    "16": "Reaffirm the importance of collaboration and cooperation at the global and regional level, in particular across the health, finance, trade and development sectors, in order to enhance collective actions to end tuberculosis;",
    "17": "Commend the progress achieved in saving 74 million lives across all countries between 2000 and 2021 through provision of tuberculosis treatment for people with tuberculosis and antiretroviral therapy for people with HIV co-infected with tuberculosis, and regret that only some progress has been achieved towards targets and commitments agreed in the political declaration of the 2018 high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the fight against tuberculosis;",
    "18": "Note with concern that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a damaging impact on access to tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care and the burden of tuberculosis disease and that progress made in the years up to 2019 has slowed, stalled or reversed, and global tuberculosis targets are off track, and that the number of people diagnosed with tuberculosis and notified to public health reporting systems fell by 18 per cent from 7.1 million in 2019 to 5.8 million in 2020, followed by a partial recovery to 6.4 million in 2021, and that as a result of these disruptions, the number of people who died from tuberculosis increased in 2020 and 2021 compared to prior years, and the number of people who fell ill from tuberculosis increased in 2021;",
    "19": " (b) And only 12.5 million people, including 10.3 million people living with HIV, 1.6 million children under the age of 5 who are household contacts of people affected by tuberculosis and 0.6 million other household contacts of people affected by tuberculosis, were provided with tuberculosis preventive treatment, which translates to 42 per cent of the 30 million target agreed in the 2018 political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the fight against tuberculosis; (c) And that close to half of the people diagnosed with tuberculosis and their families experienced financial hardship because of tuberculosis;",
    "20": "Welcome the commitment and support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, through the seventh replenishment held in September 2022, which will help to sustain support for tuberculosis programmes;",
    "21": "Recognize the need to mobilize sufficient and sustainable financing for universal access to quality prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of tuberculosis, from all sources, with the aim of increasing overall global investments for ending tuberculosis, and to align with overall national health financing strategies, including in developing countries, to raise domestic revenues and provide international financial support, including at bilateral, regional and global levels, towards achieving universal health coverage and social protection strategies, in the lead-up to 2030;",
    "22": "Welcome progress in reaching 10.3 million people living with HIV with tuberculosis preventive treatment between 2018 and 2021, surpassing the target of reaching 6 million people between 2018 and 2022 set at the 2018 high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the fight against tuberculosis, with a total of 16 million receiving tuberculosis preventive treatment since 2005 when the policy was introduced, which translates to 42 per cent of people living with HIV having benefited from tuberculosis preventive treatment by 2021, although this remains far from reaching the 90 per cent target by 2025, agreed in the political declaration of the high- level meeting of the General Assembly on HIV and AIDS;",
    "23": "Note with concern that, although people living with HIV are about 16 times more likely to fall ill from tuberculosis compared to people without HIV and that tuberculosis remains the leading cause of severe illness and death of people living with HIV, almost half of people with HIV-associated tuberculosis are not diagnosed and treated for tuberculosis, and also note that in 2021, testing for HIV among people with tuberculosis increased to 76 per cent compared to 64 per cent in 2018 and that 89 per cent of people living with HIV who were diagnosed with tuberculosis were on antiretroviral treatment in 2021;",
    "24": "Acknowledge that ending tuberculosis requires accelerating progress towards universal health coverage, particularly through strong and sustainable primary health care, with multisectoral approaches that address tuberculosis determinants, that engages people affected by tuberculosis and civil society, and reaches people with tuberculosis, or at risk of tuberculosis, with equitable and affordable access to high-quality services, close to their everyday environments, enabling them to fully enjoy the benefits of scientific advances, and free of financial hardship;",
    "25": " access to quality diagnosis, treatment and care for those affected, and there is still a low treatment success rate for those who are treated, and therefore acknowledge that it is necessary to ensure global collaboration, sustainable and sufficient political buy-in and financial investment from all sources, strong and resilient health systems, and additional investment in research, development and innovation, recognizing that innovation has the potential to benefit society at large;",
    "26": "Express concern that close to half a million people annually develop tuberculosis that is resistant to at least rifampicin, the most effective first-line drug, of whom only one in three accessed treatment in 2021 and of these, 40 per cent had poor health outcomes for reasons including gaps in access to World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic tests and treatment, inefficient service delivery models, medication side-effects, lack of access to treatment support, comprehensive social protection and care and acknowledged lack of attention and care to the needs of tuberculosis survivors for post-treatment follow-up, particularly drug-resistant tuberculosis survivors;",
    "27": "Remain deeply concerned that financing for tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care is inadequate, that overall total annual funding was consistently less than half of the 13 billion United States dollars a year target set at the 2018 high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the fight against tuberculosis, that domestic funding declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, while acknowledging that investment in care and the prevention of tuberculosis brings some of the largest gains in terms of lives saved and economic benefits from development investments;",
    "28": "Stress the importance of domestic and international funding for the tuberculosis response, particularly in high-burden countries, and note that overall international funding has stagnated since 2018, and stressing therefore the importance of adequately replenishing voluntary international financing mechanisms such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Unitaid, other sources of financing, including official development assistance, as well as innovative financing to support comprehensive national tuberculosis strategies as an integral part of costed national health strategies, multilateral efforts and other initiatives, to end tuberculosis;",
    "29": "Reaffirm the central role of the World Health Organization as the leading agency on health in providing technical advice, guidance, direction and support on tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care, and urgently support its Global Tuberculosis Programme, to end tuberculosis worldwide;",
    "30": "Commend progress achieved so far in tuberculosis research and innovation of new tests, drugs and regimens that informed World Health Organization guidance,9 including on the use of shorter-duration tuberculosis preventive treatment with less pill burden, shorter-duration regimens for the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis for adults and children, and more effective all-oral shorter-duration regimens for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis, including formulations appropriate for children, and note that although 26 high-tuberculosis-burden countries are using World Health Organization-recommended rapid molecular diagnostic tests and 126 countries have introduced all-oral regimens to treat drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis, supply and access to some drugs central to these regimens is not yet universally available;",
    "31": "Recognize that reaching the 2030 global tuberculosis targets requires, inter alia, technological breakthroughs by 2025, so that the annual decline in global tuberculosis incidence can be accelerated to an average of 17 per cent per year, and research and development is critical to achieving that goal;",
    "32": "Recall with concern that no new vaccines for prevention of all forms of tuberculosis have been licensed for over 100 years, that safe, effective, affordable, accessible and preventive vaccines for people of all ages which can be administered before or after exposure are essential to accelerate the decline in illness and mortality and reduce antimicrobial resistance, and acknowledge the importance of global collaboration and increased investment to fast-track progress and ensure equitable access and maximal return on public investment in scientific progress;",
    "33": "Recall with concern that the utilization of World Health Organization- recommended rapid molecular diagnostics remains far too limited, and that in 2021, only 38 per cent of the 6.4 million people newly diagnosed with tuberculosis were initially tested with World Health Organization-recommended rapid molecular diagnostics, and acknowledging that the limited utilization of these rapid tests underscores the urgent need for enhanced global collaboration to facilitate their wider use to ensure more timely and accurate tuberculosis diagnoses, while further research on point-of-care tests is urgently required;",
    "34": "Express concern that financing for tuberculosis research and innovation is only half of the 2 billion United States dollars a year target agreed in the 2018 political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the fight against tuberculosis, and underscore that enhanced, sustained and equitable financing is required for the development and evaluation of better tools and strategies to ensure tuberculosis prevention and care for all, including to address social and economic determinants of the disease, as called for in the global strategy for tuberculosis research and innovation, 10 taking into account that an additional investment in research, development and innovation has the potential to benefit society at large;",
    "35": "Recognize the importance of national systems that monitor the availability, accessibility, acceptability, affordability and quality of tuberculosis care at their respective national level;",
    "36": "Welcome the roll-out of the World Health Organization multisectoral accountability framework for tuberculosis as requested in General Assembly resolution 73/3 and World Health Assembly resolution 71.3, and emphasize the continued importance of multisectoral action and accountability, as appropriate, across the health and nutrition, finance, labour, social protection, education, science and technology, justice, agriculture, the environment, including air quality, housing, trade, development and other sectors, in order to ensure that all relevant stakeholders pursue actions to end tuberculosis and leave no one behind through whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches;",
    "37": "Recognize that equitable, affordable and sustainable access to high-quality tuberculosis diagnostics, vaccines and medicines, including for preventive treatment, are essential to end illness, suffering and prevent further loss of life from tuberculosis, and further recognize the role played by relevant international organizations and initiatives, such as the Stop TB Partnership/Global Drug Facility, working to improve access to high-quality and affordable medicines, including appropriate formulations of medicines for children, and diagnostics to test, prevent and treat tuberculosis for populations in need;",
