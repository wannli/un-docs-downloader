  "paragraphs": {
    "1": "Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;19",
    "2": "Emphasizes that the use and implementation of the integrated coastal zone management approach and other area-based management approaches can contribute significantly towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and their targets;20",
    "3": "Also emphasizes that coastal areas are an essential ecological and economic resource, that their management and planning from a sustainable development perspective need an integrated management approach, and that integrated coastal zone management is an important vehicle for sustainable development, sustainable ocean-based economy and poverty eradication;",
    "4": "Calls upon Member States and other actors at the local, national, regional and international levels, including in the private sector, civil society and academia, to address the problem of marine pollution and litter, including plastic litter and microplastics, which impacts coastal management, and encourages all stakeholders operating in this field, in their response to and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, to prioritize life-cycle approaches, to promote resource efficiency and to incorporate biodiversity and coastal ecosystem services in their integral management, building on existing initiatives and instruments, science, international cooperation and multi-stakeholder engagement, and in this regard calls upon Member States to prevent, reduce and control marine pollution of all kinds through improving understanding of their sources, pathways and impacts on marine ecosystems, to reduce the level of pollution of coastal areas, to protect marine ecosystems and coastal areas in the long term and to develop partnerships allowing the exchange of good practices in integrated coastal zone management, marine spatial planning and the implementation of sustainable economic models and approaches, bearing in mind that international cooperation for the implementation of marine spatial planning can contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources and the maintenance of ecosystem integrity and can improve the economic profitability of marine management and the use of resources;",
    "5": "Welcomes the holding of the first and the second sessions of the intergovernmental negotiating committee, established by the United Nations Environment Assembly in its resolution 5/14 of 2 March 202221 at its resumed fifth session to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, and in this regard welcomes the commitment made by Heads of State and Government in the political declaration adopted during the 2023 Sustainable Development Goals Summit to support the ongoing work of the intergovernmental negotiating committee, with the ambition of completing its work by the end of 2024;",
    "6": "Underlines that integrated coastal zone management is a dynamic process for the sustainable management and use of coastal zones, taking into account at the same time the fragility of coastal ecosystems and landscapes, the diversity of activities and uses, their interactions, the maritime orientation of certain activities and uses and their impact on both the marine and land parts;",
    "7": "Encourages Member States to consider the definition and implementation of an integrated coastal zone management approach, including through appropriate national planning tools and an ecosystem approach that integrates land, sea and watershed areas, and to consider investing in long-term planning to address barriers to integrated coastal zone management implementation;",
    "8": "Also encourages Member States to consider strengthening or, where applicable, establishing coordinating mechanisms for the integrated management and sustainable development of coastal and marine areas and their resources, at the local, national and regional levels;",
    "9": "Further encourages Member States to take concrete measures to integrate poverty eradication, quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, sustainable transport, science, technology and innovation into integrated coastal zone management;",
    "10": "Stresses the importance of policies and plans for disaster risk reduction, including adaptation, and hazards preparedness, such as early warning systems, to build resilience and reduce the impacts and costs of natural disasters, also stresses the importance of biodiversity conservation, restoration, and sustainable use and nature- based solutions, ecosystem-based approaches and other management and conservation approaches, in line with United Nations Environment Assembly resolution 5/5 of 2 March 2022,22 including for the delivery of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and encourages Member States to incorporate, in a more targeted manner, these elements as part of their approach to integrated coastal zone management;",
    "11": "Also stresses the importance of promoting coordination at the national and local levels with regard to coastal areas, with the aim of ensuring policy coherence, as well as the effectiveness of coastal management measures, while ensuring the participation of all relevant stakeholders, including people in vulnerable situations;",
    "12": "Emphasizes the importance of scaling up climate adaptation finance, in line with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, including in the context of coastal resilience, through the application of integrated coastal zone management to enable national-level adaptation planning, urges developed country parties to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing country parties from 2019 levels by 2025, in the context of achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation in the provision of scaled-up financial resources, emphasizes the urgency of scaling up action and support, including finance, capacity-building and technology transfer, to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change, and calls upon the shareholders of multilateral development banks and international financial institutions to reform the practices and priorities of multilateral development banks, align and scale up funding, ensure simplified access and mobilize climate finance from various sources;",
    "13": "Also emphasizes the importance of partnerships, of bringing together multi-stakeholder actors to enable the integration of different interests and knowledge into planning processes or strategies and helping to ensure that area-based management approach design is based on the best available science and other knowledge systems, such as traditional knowledge, innovations and practices;",
    "14": "Further emphasizes that international and regional cooperation, including North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation, and capacity-building and technical support for developing countries and public-private partnerships, are an important factor in the promotion and implementation of the integrated coastal zone management approach by, inter alia, promoting peer learning and cooperation, developing the necessary coastal systematic observation, research and information management systems and developing technologies, the science-policy interface and technological capacities, as well as building effective linkages among global, regional, subregional and national processes, as appropriate, to advance the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals;",
    "15": "Reaffirms the importance of strong regional cooperation and economic integration among countries to advance sustainable ocean-based economy and implement effective integrated coastal zone management policies and strategies, which can unlock mutual benefits;",
    "16": "Calls upon the United Nations Environment Programme and other relevant United Nations entities, within their mandates and existing resources, to support the efforts of Member States in promoting and implementing the integrated coastal zone management approach, as well as in mobilizing partnerships and initiatives at the local, national and regional levels;",
