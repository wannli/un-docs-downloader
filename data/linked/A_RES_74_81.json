    "1": "Commends the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation for the valuable contribution that it has been making since its inception to wider knowledge and understanding of the levels, effects and risks of exposure to ionizing radiation and for fulfilling its original mandate with scientific authority and independence of judgment;",
    "2": "Reaffirms the decision to maintain the present functions and independent role of the Scientific Committee;",
    "3": "Re-emphasizes the need for the Scientific Committee to hold regular sessions on an annual basis so that its report will be able to reflect the latest developments and findings in the field of ionizing radiation and thereby provide updated information for dissemination among all States;",
    "4": "Notes with appreciation the work of the Scientific Committee, takes note of the report on its sixty-sixth session,2 including the report on the implementation of its long-term strategic directions, and encourages the Committee, over its coming sessions, to continue to work towards implementing strategies to support its long- term efforts to serve the scientific community, as well as wider audiences;",
    "5": "Welcomes the continuation of the ad hoc working group to assist the Scientific Committee in developing its future programme of work on the effects of radiation exposure and the biological mechanisms by which they occur; 3",
    "6": "Also welcomes the establishment of an ad hoc working group on sources and exposure, following the experience of the ad hoc working group on effects and mechanisms;3",
    "7": "Appreciates the arrangements made by the Scientific Committee for activities to follow up on its 2013 evaluation of the levels and effects of radiation exposure due to the nuclear accident after the 2011 great east-Japan earthquake and tsunami, looks forward to the Committee\u2019s evaluation of the implications of the information published since the 2013 report, and encourages the secretariat of the Committee to disseminate the findings of the Committee\u2019s evaluation, in particular to the public;",

    "9": "Looks forward to the Scientific Committee\u2019s evaluations of biological mechanisms relevant for the inference of cancer risk after low-dose radiation exposure, and the assessments of human exposures to medical ionizing radiation and occupational ionizing radiation;",
    "10": "Requests the Scientific Committee to continue its work, including its important activities to increase knowledge of the levels, effects and risks of ionizing radiation from all sources, and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session;",
    "11": "Supports the intentions and plans of the Scientific Committee for conducting its programme of work of scientific review and assessment on behalf of the General Assembly, in particular its next global survey of public radiation exposure, its assessments of second primary cancer after radiotherapy and its epidemiological studies of radiation and cancer, to be conducted in close cooperation with other relevant organizations, and requests the Committee to submit plans for its ongoing and future programme of work to the Assembly at its seventy-fifth session;",
    "12": "Welcomes developments in streamlining procedures for publishing the reports of the Scientific Committee electronically on its official website and as sales publications, and calls upon the secretariat to continue both to monitor the timely publication of those reports and to strive to publish them within the same calendar year as their approval;",

    "14": "Welcomes, in this context, the readiness of Member States to provide the Scientific Committee with relevant information on the levels and effects of ionizing radiation, and invites the Committee to analyse and give due consideration to such information, particularly in the light of its own findings;",
    "15": "Recalls the strategy of the Scientific Committee to improve data collection, encourages in this regard Member States, the organizations of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations concerned to provide further relevant data about levels, effects and risks of radiation exposure from various sources, which would greatly help in the preparation of future reports of the Committee to the General Assembly, and encourages the International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization and other relevant organizations to further collaborate with the secretariat on arrangements for the collection, analysis and dissemination of data on radiation exposures of patients, workers and the public;",
    "16": "Welcomes the use and ongoing development by the secretariat of an online platform for collecting data on the exposure of patients, workers and the public, and urges Member States to take part in the Scientific Committee\u2019s global surveys of radiation exposure and to nominate a national contact person to facilitate coordination of the collection and submission of data on the exposure of patients, workers and the public within the country;",
    "17": "Also welcomes the Scientific Committee\u2019s outreach strategy for the period 2020\u20132024, in particular the enhancement of the website of the Committee and the publication of information for the general public in all the official languages of the United Nations, continues to encourage that consideration be given to publishing the website in all of those languages, and notes that the dissemination of the Committee\u2019s findings and further enhancements to the website would depend on the financial and human resources made available to the secretariat;",
    "18": "Requests the United Nations Environment Programme to continue, within existing resources, to service the Scientific Committee and to disseminate its findings to Member States, the scientific community and the public and to ensure that the administrative measures in place are appropriate, including clear roles and responsibilities of the various actors, so that the secretariat is able to adequately and efficiently service the Committee in a predictable and sustainable manner and effectively facilitate the use of the invaluable expertise offered to the Committee by its members in order that the Committee may discharge the responsibilities and mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly;",
