  "paragraphs": {
    "1": "We, the Heads of State and Government and high representatives, have met at United Nations Headquarters in New York on 18 and 19 September 2023, at the Sustainable Development Goals Summit, 1 to review progress and accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.",
    "2": "We reaffirm our commitment to effectively implement the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs and uphold all principles enshrined in it. The 2030 Agenda remains our overarching roadmap for achieving sustainable development and overcoming the multiple crises we face. We will act with urgency to realize its vision as a plan of action for people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership, leaving no one behind. We will endeavour to reach the furthest behind first.",
    "3": "We emphasize that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.",
    "4": "We reaffirm that the 2030 Agenda is universal in nature and that its Goals and targets are comprehensive, far-reaching, people-centered, indivisible and interlinked, balancing the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental, in an integrated manner. They seek to realize the human rights of all and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.",
    "5": "We reaffirm that the 2030 Agenda is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including full respect for international law. It is grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international human rights treaties, the Millennium Declaration and the 2005 World Summit Outcome. It is informed by other instruments such as the Declaration on the Right to Development.",
    "6": "We also reaffirm the Addis Ababa Action Agenda as an integral part of the 2030 Agenda. We are committed to its full implementation which is critical for the realization of the SDGs and their targets and to this end welcome the organization of the 2023 High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development back-to-back with the SDG Summit.",
    "7": "We also reaffirm that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. We express profound alarm that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise globally, and remain deeply concerned that all countries, particularly developing countries, are vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. We emphasize in this regard that mitigation of and adaptation to climate change represent an immediate and urgent priority.",
    "8": "The achievement of the SDGs is in peril. At the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda, we are alarmed that the progress on most of the SDGs is either moving much too slowly or has regressed below the 2015 baseline. Our world is currently facing numerous crises. Years of sustainable development gains are being reversed. Millions of people have fallen into poverty, hunger and malnutrition are becoming more prevalent, humanitarian needs are rising, and the impacts of climate change more pronounced. This has led to increased inequality exacerbated by weakened international solidarity and a shortfall of trust to jointly overcome these crises.",
    "9": "We commit to bold, ambitious, accelerated, just and transformative actions, anchored in international solidarity and effective cooperation at all levels. We will promote a systemic shift towards a more inclusive, just, peaceful, resilient and sustainable world for people and planet, for present and future generations.",

    "14": "We remain resolved, between now and 2030, to end poverty and hunger everywhere; to combat inequalities within and among countries; to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies; to respect, protect and fulfil human rights and achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and to ensure the lasting protection of the planet and its natural resources. We also remain resolved to create conditions for sustainable, inclusive and sustained economic growth, shared prosperity and decent work for all, and equal pay for work of equal value, taking into account different levels of national development and capacities. We take note with appreciation of the Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transitions and encourage all countries to consider supporting its implementation. We commit to ensuring that persons with disabilities actively participate in and equally benefit from sustainable development efforts.",
    "15": "We reaffirm that gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls will make a crucial contribution to progress across all the Goals and targets. The achievement of full human potential and sustainable development is not possible if one half of humanity continues to be denied full human rights and opportunities. We will ensure full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all women and girls, without discrimination. We also resolve to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls.",

We reaffirm the need to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies that provide equal access to justice and that are based on respect for human rights (including the right to development), on effective rule of law and good governance at all levels and on transparent, effective and accountable institutions. Factors which give rise to violence, insecurity and injustice, such as inequality, corruption, poor governance and illicit financial and arms flows, are addressed in the Agenda.",
    "21": "The 2030 Agenda remains our commitment to the children and youth of today so that they may achieve their full human potential, as critical agents of change and torchbearers of the 2030 Agenda for current and future generations.",

Our changed world \u2013 Progress and remaining gaps and challenges",
    "24": "Our world has changed drastically since the first SDG Summit in 2019 and since we adopted the 2030 Agenda in 2015. The world was already off track in achieving the majority of the SDGs before the COVID-19 pandemic. Without immediate course correction and acceleration of progress toward achieving the SDGs, our world is destined to face continued poverty, prolonged periods of crisis and growing uncertainty.",
    "25": "We are concerned about the persistent and long-term impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, continued poverty and widening inequalities, and the multiple interlinked crises that are pushing our world to the brink, particularly in developing countries and for the poorest and most vulnerable. The crisis of climate change and its impacts, including persistent drought and extreme weather events, land loss and degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion, ocean acidification and the retreat of mountain glaciers, as well as biodiversity loss, desertification, sand and dust storms, and pollution, including plastic, air, and chemical pollution, threaten planet and people. Forced displacement, the cost-of-living, water, food security and nutrition, financial and energy crises and challenges are derailing progress on the Sustainable Development Goals.",
    "26": "In many parts of the world armed conflicts and instability have persisted or intensified, causing untold human suffering and undermining the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals. Our efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts and foster peaceful, just and inclusive societies have often been fragmented and insufficient and have been hindered in the current global context.",
    "27": "We acknowledge that the cascading global crises have highlighted and exacerbated existing gender inequality, such as unequal access to healthcare, education, social protection, decent jobs and economic opportunities.",

    "30": "We must meet the moment by taking immediate measures to scale up efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, including through development cooperation, SDG investments, reforming the international financial architecture, supporting sustained, inclusive and sustainable growth, enhancing macroeconomic policy cooperation, exploring measures of progress on sustainable development that complement or go beyond gross domestic product, and implementing actions to accelerate sustainable development, in particular in support of developing countries.",

Those whose needs are reflected in the 2030 Agenda include all children, youth, persons with disabilities, people living with HIV/AIDS, older persons, Indigenous Peoples, refugees, internally displaced persons, and migrants.

We look forward to concrete and positive results at the 13th WTO Ministerial Conference.
