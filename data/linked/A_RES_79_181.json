    "2": "Expresses its very serious concern about: (a) The persistence of continuing reports of violations of human rights, including the detailed findings made by the commission of inquiry in its report, by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in its ongoing monitoring and documentation work and by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, such as: (i) Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including inhuman conditions of detention; all forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including rape, in particular against women and girls; extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions; the imposition of the death penalty for political and religious reasons; public executions; extrajudicial and arbitrary detention; the absence of fair trial guarantees and the rule of law, including an independent judiciary; collective punishments extending up to three generations; and the extensive use of forced labour, including of children; (ii) The existence of an extensive penal system including political prison camps, re-education camps, labour training camps, labour training centres, detention centres, holding centres and waiting rooms, where a vast number of persons are deprived of their liberty and subjected to deplorable conditions, including forced labour, and where alarming violations of human rights are perpetrated; (iii) Enforced and involuntary disappearances of persons by arrest, detention or abduction against their will; refusal to disclose the fate and whereabouts of the persons concerned; and refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their liberty, which places such persons subjected thereto outside the protection of the law and which has had the effect of inflicting severe suffering on them and their families; (iv) The forcible transfer of populations and the limitations imposed on persons wishing to move freely within the country and travel abroad, including harming or punishing those who leave or try to leave the country without permission, or their families, as well as punishment of persons who are returned; (v) The situation of refugees and asylum-seekers expelled or returned to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, including where the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea exerts pressure on returning States to effectuate such returns, and retaliations against citizens of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea who have been repatriated from abroad, leading to punishments of internment, torture, other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sexual and gender-based violence, including forced abortions and infanticide against repatriated mothers and their children, or the death penalty, and in this regard strongly urges all Member States to respect the fundamental principle of non-refoulement, especially in the light of a resumption of cross-border travel, including where the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea exerts pressure on returning States to effectuate such returns, to take action to counter acts of transnational repression by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, to treat those who seek refuge humanely and to ensure unhindered access to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and his Office, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, with a view to protecting the human rights of those who seek refuge, and to refrain from sharing information about the contacts and conduct of refugees, asylum-seekers and other citizens of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea with the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, and once again urges States parties to comply with their obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees 19 and the 1967 Protocol thereto 20 in relation to refugees from the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea who are covered by those instruments, as well as under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;21 (vi) All-pervasive and severe restrictions, including an absolute monopoly on information and total control over organized social life, further tightened by newly enacted laws, namely the Law on Rejecting Reactionary Thought and Culture, the Youth Education Guarantee Law and the Law on Protecting the Pyongyang Cultural Language of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, both online and offline, on the rights to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and association, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art or through any other media of one\u2019s choice, the right not to be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with individual privacy, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or imprisonment of individuals exercising their rights to freedom of opinion and expression and religion or belief, and the right of everyone, including women, to take part without unreasonable restriction in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives, of their country; (vii) Violations of economic, social and cultural rights, exacerbated by the continued closure by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea of its borders, which have led to food insecurity, severe hunger, malnutrition, widespread health problems and other hardship for the population in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, in particular for women, children, persons with disabilities, older persons and prisoners throughout the entire penal system and in all places of detention; (viii) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all women and girls, including unequal access to employment and discriminatory regulations; as well as, in particular, the creation of internal conditions that force women and girls to leave the country, making them extremely vulnerable to trafficking in persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation, forced labour, domestic servitude or forced marriage, and their subjection to sexual and gender-based discrimination, including in the political and social spheres, as well as throughout the entire penal system, including through forced abortions, invasive body cavity searches and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence; (ix) Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of children, in particular the continued lack of access to basic economic, social and cultural rights for many children, and in this regard notes the particularly vulnerable situation faced by, inter alia, returned or repatriated children, children without housing, children with disabilities, children whose parents are detained, deceased or otherwise absent, children living in detention or in institutions and children in conflict with the law, and further notes with concern the reports of harsh and disproportionate punishment inflicted upon children;

(xii) Discrimination based on the songbun system, which classifies people on the basis of State-assigned social class and birth and also includes consideration of political opinions and religion; (xiii) Violence and discrimination against women, including unequal access to employment and discriminatory laws and regulations; (b) The continued refusal of the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to extend an invitation to the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, to engage and give consideration to the reports and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, or to extend cooperation to the Special Rapporteur and several other United Nations special procedures, in accordance with their terms of reference, as well as to other United Nations human rights mechanisms; (c) The continued lack of acknowledgement by the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea of the grave human rights situation in the country and its consequential lack of action to report on the state of implementation of the recommendations contained in the outcome of its first,23 second24 and third25 universal periodic reviews and to give consideration to the concluding observations of the treaty bodies;",
