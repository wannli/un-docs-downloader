Background information on those items may be found in the annotations to the agenda (see A/80/100 and A/80/100/Add.1). Programme of work The draft programme of work (see annex) has been prepared bearing in mind paragraph (b) of rule 99 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, Assembly decision 79/540 on the programme of work of the Third Committee for the eightieth session, the provisional agenda of the eightieth session (A/80/150) and relevant resolutions and decisions adopted by the Assembly on the rationalization of its work and that of the Committee, as well as past experience in the utilization of conference services. The modalities on the arrangements for the work of the Third Committee at the eightieth session have been revised pursuant to the proposal submitted by the Bureau, taking into account the continued limitations arising from the liquidity crisis. These arrangements are exceptional and will not constitute a precedent for the programme of work of the eighty-first or any future session, irrespective of meeting entitlements or liquidity constraints. The Bureau remains committed to exploring all options thoroughly and to restore the traditional format of general discussions on individual items or clusters, alongside interactive dialogues, in its recommendation for the programme of work of the eighty-first session. Question time and interactive dialogues In accordance with the established practice of the Committee and pursuant to paragraphs 3 (c) and (d) of the annex to General Assembly resolution 58/316 on further measures for the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly, immediately following the introduction of reports, interactive dialogues or a \u201cquestion time\u201d will be held with heads of departments and offices, representatives of the Secretary-General, special rapporteurs and other special mechanisms as part of the formal proceedings of the Committee. Delegations are invited to participate actively in the dialogues with questions and unscripted comments, which are limited A/C.3/80/L.1 25-14215 2/10 to two to three minutes or less for single dialogues and six to nine minutes or less for combined dialogues. General debate Also pursuant to the proposal submitted by the Bureau, on an exceptional basis, the general discussion of each agenda item or cluster of agenda items will be replaced by a single general debate to be held prior to the start of the interactive dialogues. This arrangement will not establish a precedent for future sessions. Statements by delegations The list of speakers for the general debate on any or all agenda items allocated to the Committee will be opened on Tuesday, 16 September 2025. Statements made during the general debate under any or all agenda items will be limited to 10 minutes for individual delegations and to 12 minutes for statements made on behalf of a group of delegations. A digital timer will be projected on the screen so that speakers can keep track of their speaking time, with microphones switched off automatically after the allotted time. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 72/313, delegations are encouraged to adhere to the \u201call protocol observed\u201d principle and to refrain from listing standard protocol expressions during their statements. In the same resolution, the Assembly recommended that speakers should be mindful of the speed of statement delivery, bearing in mind the need for accuracy of interpretation. As per past practice, the Committee will maintain a \u201crolling\u201d list of speakers for the general debate, which means that delegations should be ready to deliver their statements earlier, if necessary. In accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, delegations should exercise their right of reply at the end of the day whenever two meetings have been scheduled for the consideration of the relevant agenda item on that day, or at the conclusion of the consideration of the item, if that is sooner. The first statement should be limited to five minutes and the second, if any, to three minutes. Also in accordance with previous decisions of the General Assembly and the practice of the Committee, explanations of vote and points of order should be limited to three minutes. List of documents Attention is drawn to the addendum to the present note (to be issued as A/C.3/80/L.1/Add.1), which will contain a list of the documentation submitted under each agenda item expected to be allocated to the Committee. The list of documents, with any updates, will be available on iGov. Conference facilities and meeting arrangements Unless otherwise specified, formal meetings of the Committee will be held from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 to 6 p.m. in Conference Room 1 (Conference Building). The General Assembly has stressed that a punctual start of meetings is critical to the efficient utilization of services allocated to the intergovernmental bodies of the United Nations. In accordance with past practice, it is proposed that rule 108 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly be waived with respect to the quorum needed to declare a meeting open. Deadlines and sponsorship of draft resolutions and proposals Sponsors are responsible for ensuring accurate and timely submission of their proposal, in accordance with the submission guidelines and prior to the Committee- A/C.3/80/L.1 3/10 25-14215 approved deadline. Adherence to the deadlines is critical to ensuring the successful conclusion of the work of the Committee. The initiation and sponsorship of draft proposals will be undertaken electronically through the eSponsorship application without prejudice to the possibility offered to delegations of co-sponsoring a proposal at the time of the Committee\u2019s action on the latter. To maximize the efficiency of the Committee, however, all delegations wishing to co-sponsor a proposal are encouraged to do so electronically through the eSponsorship application rather than during the formal proceedings of the Committee. Introduction of draft resolutions In line with efforts to further enhance the efficiency of the Committee, main sponsors of proposals are urged to limit the introduction of their proposals, which may be made solely at the time of their consideration by the Committee, to statements not exceeding three minutes. Main sponsors are requested not to make a formal introductory statement on a draft resolution upon its issuance as an \u201cL\u201d document. Report of the Economic and Social Council In paragraph 4 (c) of the annex to General Assembly resolution 58/316, the Assembly decided that the item entitled \u201cReport of the Economic and Social Council\u201d should be considered in its entirety in plenary meeting. Subsequently, it was clarified that, in implementing that decision, the relevant parts of chapter I of the report of the Council that related to agenda items allocated to the Main Committees would be considered by the Committee concerned, for final action by the Assembly (see A/59/250/Add.1, para. 4). Report of the Human Rights Council In its resolution 65/281, entitled \u201cReview of the Human Rights Council\u201d, the General Assembly decided to continue its practice of allocating the item entitled \u201cReport of the Human Rights Council\u201d to the plenary of the Assembly and to the Third Committee, in accordance with its decision 65/503 A, with the understanding that the President of the Council will present the report in her or his capacity as President to the plenary of the Assembly and to the Committee and that the Committee will hold an interactive dialogue with the President of the Council following the presentation of the report of the Council to the Committee. Conclusion of the work of the Committee Bearing in mind the number of meetings allocated to the Committee, a target date of 21 November 2025 has been set for the conclusion of its work. The Committee will, however, endeavour to conclude its work earlier, if possible.

eighty-first session of the General Assembly Programme planning (item 137) Conclusion of the work of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) for the main part of the session In the preparation of the timetable above, the Chair was guided by the following considerations: (a) In accordance with established procedures and practices and bearing in mind the availability of documentation, the Committee may wish to hold one joint general debate covering agenda items 54 to 58 and individual debates on agenda items 46 to 53, 59, 121 and 137, on the understanding that draft resolutions and/or decisions will be considered separately; (b) Representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories and petitioners will be heard as early as possible during the Committee\u2019s consideration of the related items, and the Chair suggests that the Committee devote its meetings from Tuesday, 7 October to Monday, 13 October, to the hearing of petitioners; (c) Item 121, Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly, is allocated to all the Main Committees for the sole purpose of considering and taking action on their respective tentative programme of work; A/C.4/80/L.1 25-14603 8/8 (d) Item 137, Programme planning, is allocated to all the Main Committees and the plenary of the General Assembly to enhance the discussion of evaluation, planning, budgeting and monitoring reports. If the Assembly allocates any report submitted under this item to the Fourth Committee, the Committee shall revert to this item. Subject to the provisional programme of work above being acceptable to the Committee and in order to facilitate its work, the Chair wishes to suggest that the list of speakers in the general debate for the respective agenda items be closed as indicated in the timetable above. The Chair also wishes to draw the attention of members of the Committee to the decisions of the General Assembly on the organization of its work contained in document A/80/250, sections II.B to III. Members are also requested to bear in mind the decision of the General Assembly that morning and afternoon meetings should start promptly at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., respectively, both for plenary meetings and for meetings of the Main Committees during the eightieth session. The attention of the members is also drawn to the decision of the Assembly to waive, at its eightieth session, the quorum required, under rule 108 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, for the Chair to declare a meeting open and permit the debate to proceed (see A/80/250, para. 8). In view of the limited number of meetings available to the Committee, it is suggested that the time limit for statements be set at 10 minutes, with the exception of statements made by the spokespersons of groups of delegations, which would be extended to 15 minutes. In this connection, the Chair will set the time limit for the petitioners as deemed necessary.

It shall at the beginning of the session adopt a programme of work indicating, if possible, a target date for the A/C.6/80/L.1 25-14774 6/10 conclusion of its work, the approximate dates of consideration of items and the number of meetings to be allocated to each item. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 77/335 on further measures for the revitalization of the work of the Assembly, upon the recommendation of the Sixth Committee, the Assembly, at its 47th plenary meeting, held on 4 December 2024, adopted decision 79/524 containing the provisional programme of work of the Committee for the eightieth session of the Assembly. The General Assembly, at its 2nd plenary meeting, held on 12 September 2025, upon the recommendation of the General Committee (see A/80/250), fixed the target date of 21 November 2025 for the completion of the work of the Sixth Committee. The Bureau of the Committee has considered the provisional programme of work as contained in decision 79/524 and has taken into account the allocation of additional items (requests for observer status in the General Assembly) to the Committee by the General Assembly, as well as the reduction of the length of the report of the International Law Commission on the work of its seventy-sixth session (as a consequence of the reduction of the length of the Commission\u2019s session) and the anticipated workload at the present session. The programme has been prepared accordingly.

In the light of that, three meetings, to be held on 15 October and 3 and 7 November, have been suggested for that purpose. Concerning agenda item 109, entitled \u201cMeasures to eliminate international terrorism\u201d, the General Assembly, by its resolution 79/129, decided to recommend that the Sixth Committee, at the eightieth session of the Assembly, establish a working group with a view to finalizing the process on the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism as well as discussions on the item included in its agenda by Assembly resolution 54/110 concerning the question of convening a high-level conference under the auspices of the United Nations. In the light of that, two meetings, to be held on 17 October and 6 November, have been suggested for that purpose. The consideration of the reports of the working groups in plenary is scheduled for 14 November. It has also been suggested that the following be held: a briefing on agenda item 77, entitled \u201cCriminal accountability of United Nations officials and experts on mission\u201d, on 16 October; and an informal briefing on agenda item 146, entitled \u201cAdministration of justice at the United Nations\u201d, on 17 October. In view of the limited conference services available to the Sixth Committee (see para. 22), any meetings for the working groups or for informal consultations are accommodated within the overall meetings allocated to the Committee. Concerning agenda item 86, entitled \u201cProtection of persons in the event of disasters\u201d, the General Assembly, by its resolution 79/128, decided that the Sixth Committee shall resume its session for up to five days by the end of April 2026 at the latest, in order to prepare a consolidated text that will serve as the basis for the negotiations of a legally binding instrument on the protection of persons in the event of disasters, including the draft articles on the protection of persons in the event of disasters and the proposals submitted by Governments, within the framework of a working group of the Committee. It is expected that the Sixth Committee will include, in the forthcoming draft resolution to be prepared under the agenda item, an indication of the dates and number of meetings of the working group. Statements by delegations The list of speakers for the debate on all agenda items opened on 15 September Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 72/313, delegations are encouraged to adhere to the \u201call protocol observed\u201d principle and to refrain from listing standard protocol expressions during their statements. In the same resolution, the Assembly recommended that speakers should be mindful of the speed of statement delivery, bearing in mind the need for accuracy of interpretation. The delivery of national statements will be limited to 7 minutes, and group statements to 12 minutes, for all agenda items except those dealing with the annual report of the International Law Commission, for which delegations are encouraged to limit their statements to main positions and views for a total of 12 minutes (with further information or clarifications provided in written versions made available through the eStatements portal or in written submissions to the Commission). In accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, delegations should exercise their right of reply at the end of the day whenever two meetings have been scheduled for the consideration of the relevant agenda item on that day, or at the conclusion of the consideration of the item, if that is sooner. The first statement should be limited to five minutes and the second, if any, to three minutes. Draft resolutions The initiation and sponsorship of draft resolutions, where applicable, will be undertaken electronically through the eSponsorship module for the Sixth Committee in the e-deleGATE portal. Unless otherwise agreed, coordinators or main sponsors, as applicable, of proposals for draft resolutions are encouraged to hold at least one informal consultation per proposal. The Secretariat will provide assistance where necessary. Informal consultations should be announced sufficiently in advance, including in the Journal of the United Nations, so as to allow participation by representatives of all Member States. Once consultations have concluded, it is the practice of the Sixth Committee to place proposals for draft resolutions under a silence procedure, prior to their submission for processing and issuance in all official languages as limited (\u201cL\u201d) documents. All delegations wishing to sponsor a proposal for a draft resolution, where applicable, are encouraged to do so electronically through the eSponsorship module, rather than during the formal proceedings of the Committee. This is without prejudice to the possibility of delegations sponsoring a proposal for a draft resolution at the time of the Committee\u2019s action on the latter during a plenary meeting. Sponsorship should take place at the level of the Sixth Committee, given that, once the Committee has adopted a proposal for a draft resolution and recommended its adoption by the General Assembly, its sponsorship can no longer be altered by Member States. Proposals for draft resolutions submitted on behalf of the Bureau are not subject to sponsorship. Pursuant to rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, \u201cno resolution involving expenditure shall be recommended by a committee for approval by the General Assembly unless it is accompanied by an estimate of expenditures prepared by the Secretary-General\u201d. It is therefore imperative that the Sixth Committee allow sufficient time for the preparation of estimates of expenditure by __________________ 3 See www.un.org/en/ga/sixth/80/programme.shtml. A/C.6/80/L.1 25-14774 10/10 the Secretariat and for their consideration by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth Committee. Bearing in mind that 21 November has been fixed as the concluding date for the work of the Sixth Committee (see para. 6), 7 November would have to be considered the mandatory deadline for submission to the Fifth Committee of draft resolutions with financial implications, except for draft resolutions concerning items to be considered after that date. When submitting such proposals, delegations may also wish to bear in mind that, in most cases, a period of more than 48 hours, up to four days, is required for the Secretary-General to review the programme budget implications of proposals. Accordingly, the deadline for finalization and submission of all draft resolutions for budget review and processing is 14 November 2025. Each coordinator or main sponsor, as applicable, of proposals for draft resolutions will be invited to introduce their respective draft resolutions as issued in limited distribution (\u201cL\u201d) documents. Such introductions take place at plenary meetings, and will be announced in advance, including in the Journal. Except for draft resolutions introduced at the final meeting of the substantive part of the session on 21 November 2025, it is the practice of the Committee to take action on each draft resolution at the plenary meeting following that at which the draft resolution was introduced, or at a later date. Any anticipated action on draft resolutions or decisions will be announced in advance, including in the Journal and on the website of the Committee. It is the practice of the Sixth Committee to strive for the adoption of draft resolutions without taking a vote. Conference resources available The available conference facilities will, in principle, enable the Committee to hold between three and six plenary meetings per week. Morning meetings will be held from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and afternoon meetings from 3 to 6 p.m. Unless otherwise specified, formal meetings of the Committee will be held from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 to 6 p.m. in the Trusteeship Council Chamber. The General Assembly has stressed that a punctual start to the meetings is critical to the efficient utilization of services allocated to the intergovernmental bodies of the United Nations.

We welcome the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024\u20132034 adopted by the General Assembly on 24 December 2024,1 which builds on the progress achieved under the Almaty Programme of Action: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries 2 and the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014\u201320243 and provides a renewed and action- oriented framework to support the efforts of landlocked developing countries in achieving sustainable development. I. Global context and shared commitments We gather at a critical juncture marked by overlapping global challenges, including geopolitical tensions and conflicts, food and energy crises, high transportation and trade costs, high interest rates, inflation, high indebtedness, climate change, disasters, biodiversity loss, desertification, melting glaciers and pollution. We stress the specific needs and challenges faced by landlocked developing countries due to the lack of direct territorial access to the sea, obstacles to transport and communication, long distances from major markets, cumbersome transit procedures and the lack of adequate, safe, affordable, accessible infrastructure, and recognize the need for strengthened international solidarity to support their structural transformation, industrialization, economic diversification and full integration into the regional and global economy. We recall that 2025 was proclaimed by the General Assembly as the International Year of Peace and Trust,4 and recognize that there can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development \u2013 that is also relevant for landlocked developing countries. We recognize that, despite some positive results in certain areas of the Vienna Programme of Action, progress fell short, and note with concern that a severe financing deficit, in particular for infrastructure, limited data and technical capacity constraints undermined progress in achieving the goals and targets set out in the Vienna Programme of Action. We further reaffirm our commitment to enhancing our efforts for the full and timely implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 5 and its Sustainable Development Goals, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change6 and the Paris Agreement,7 the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030,8 the New Urban Agenda9 and the Convention on Biological _______________ 1 Resolution 79/233, annex; see also resolution 79/279. 2 Report of the International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries and International Financial and Development Institutions on Transit Transport Cooperation, Almaty, Kazakhstan, 28 and 29 August 2003 (A/CONF.202/3), annex I. 3 Resolution 69/137, annex II. 4 See resolution 78/266. 5 Resolution 70/1. 6 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1771, No. 30822. 7 Adopted under the UNFCCC in FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21. 8 Resolution 69/283, annex II. 9 Resolution 71/256, annex.

We welcome the outcome document of the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development, the Sevilla Commitment, 12 which renews the global financing for development framework, building on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, 13 and call for its timely and effective implementation. We also uphold and will advance all commitments in the 2002 Monterrey Consensus14 and the 2008 Doha Declaration,15 as well as the relevant commitments in the Pact for the Future. 16 We note the interest and commitment of the landlocked developing countries to develop a dedicated work programme on landlocked developing countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We welcome the convening of the twenty-ninth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the nineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol and the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement in Baku, Azerbaijan in November 2024, as the first session of the Conference of the Parties held in a landlocked developing country, and the adoption of their decisions by Parties. We also welcome the convening of the seventeenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and the meetings of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meetings of the Parties to the Protocols to the Convention, to be held in Armenia in 2026, and the seventeenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa, to be held in Mongolia in 2026. We further welcome the convening of the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Wetlands in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, from 23 to 31 July 2025, the sixteenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to be held in Geneva in October 2025, the thirteenth session of the World Urban Forum, to be hosted by Azerbaijan from 17 to 22 May 2026, the Second Global Mountain Summit, to be held in Kyrgyzstan in 2027, and the 2028 United Nations Conference on the Final Comprehensive Review of the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Decade for Action, \u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201d, 2018\u20132028, to be hosted by Tajikistan. II. Implementation of the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024\u20132034 We strongly commit ourselves to the full implementation of the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024\u20132034 throughout the coming decade in line with its five mutually reinforcing priority areas: (a) Structural transformation and science, technology and innovation; _______________ 10 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1760, No. 30619. 11 United Nations Environment Programme, document CBD/COP/15/17, decision 15/4, annex. 12 Resolution 79/323, annex. 13 Resolution 69/313, annex. 14 Report of the International Conference on Financing for Development, Monterrey, Mexico, 18\u201322 March 2002 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.02.II.A.7), chap.

A/RES/80/3 Awaza Political Declaration 25-16680 4/5 (b) Trade, trade facilitation and regional integration; (c) Transit, transport and connectivity; (d) Enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change and disasters; (e) Means of implementation. We reaffirm our commitment to advancing the concrete deliverables outlined in the Awaza Programme of Action, with respect to establishing regional agriculture research hubs, based on interest expressed by some countries; creating a high-level panel of experts on freedom of transit for landlocked developing countries; and exploring the establishment of an infrastructure investment finance facility for landlocked developing countries. We emphasize the significance of declaring the United Nations Decade of Sustainable Transport for the 10-year period beginning on 1 January 2026, in particular for landlocked developing countries and transit countries, and look forward to an implementation plan for the Decade. We stress the importance of developing trade-related physical and digital infrastructure and facilitating inclusive, equitable and affordable connectivity for landlocked developing countries, and in this regard we invite multilateral development banks to increase investment in infrastructure, including roads, railways, waterways and ports, energy transit and connectivity infrastructure, as well as digital infrastructure, such as fibre-optic cables and satellite-based systems. Partnerships and support mechanisms We invite the landlocked developing countries, transit countries, their development partners, the United Nations system and all other relevant stakeholders to implement the relevant actions, agreed upon in the Awaza Programme of Action in its five priority areas, in a coordinated, coherent and expeditious manner consistent with national priorities. We invite the governing bodies of the United Nations funds and programmes and other multilateral organizations, including multilateral development banks and other international and regional financial institutions, as well as the World Trade Organization, to contribute to the implementation of the Awaza Programme of Action and to integrate it into their work programmes, as appropriate and in accordance with their relevant mandates. We also acknowledge the role of multilateral development banks in catalysing private investment and encourage the provision of increased concessional finance for infrastructure development to landlocked developing countries, encouraging them to enhance access to digital trade finance to help to narrow the trade finance gap. We welcome the growing role of South-South and triangular cooperation, as a complement to, and not a substitute for, North-South cooperation, peer learning and regional integration as enablers for resilience-building, innovation and cross-border cooperation. Governance, accountability and monitoring We underscore that national leadership and ownership of development strategies and policies of landlocked developing countries, transit countries and development partners must be ensured during the whole process of implementation, follow-up and monitoring. Awaza Political Declaration A/RES/80/3 5/5 25-16680 We call for closer coordination between the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States and United Nations country teams in landlocked developing countries, as an important tool for follow-up to and review of the implementation of provisions of the Awaza Programme of Action, underlining that the Office should be provided with adequate resources to fulfil its mandate, including through the existing trust fund. We also stress the critical importance of the more proactive role of United Nations agencies, including through the United Nations resident coordinators and country teams, in mobilizing all stakeholders to help Governments of landlocked developing countries to address the challenges caused by those countries\u2019 structural constraints. We emphasize that efficient and mutually complementary follow-up and monitoring mechanisms aligned with existing global frameworks and adapted at the national, subregional, regional and global levels are crucial for the successful implementation of the Awaza Programme of Action. III.

We recognize that the three core themes of social development, namely, poverty eradication, promotion of full and productive employment and decent work for all and social integration, are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, and that an enabling environment therefore needs to be created so that all three objectives can be pursued simultaneously. We share the conviction that social development and social justice are indispensable for the achievement and maintenance of peace and security within and among our nations. In turn, social development and social justice cannot be attained in the absence of peace and security or in the absence of respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms. We meet 30 years after the first World Summit for Social Development and days after the commemoration of the eightieth anniversary of the United Nations, with a determination to promote social development and social justice anchored in a strengthened and effective multilateral system, and we reaffirm and remain guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. We recommit to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, as they remain relevant and valid, and the further initiatives for social development adopted by the General Assembly, including at its twenty-fourth special session,3 and to a continued global dialogue on social development issues. We reaffirm the full, timely and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals, upholding all the principles enshrined in it, including the promise to leave no one behind and reach the furthest behind first, and to place people at the centre of development, with due consideration of the needs of present and future generations, and a strong commitment to safeguarding our planet. We also reaffirm the intergovernmental commitments related to social development, including those in the political declarations of the Sustainable Development Goals Summits held in 2019 and 2023, 4 as well as the relevant commitments in the Pact for the Future and its annexes.5 We reaffirm the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development6 as an integral part of the 2030 Agenda. We are committed to its full implementation, which is critical for the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals and their targets. We welcome the outcome document of the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development, the Sevilla Commitment, 7 which renews the global financing for development framework, building on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and call for its timely and effective implementation. We reaffirm that the pursuit and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, encompassing civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, which includes the right to development, must be respected, protected and promoted, without distinction or discrimination of any kind. __________________ 3 Resolution S-24/2, annex. 4 Resolution 74/4, annex, and resolution 78/1, annex. 5 Resolution 79/1. 6 Resolution 69/313, annex. 7 Resolution 79/323, annex.

We stress the need to take urgent and ambitious climate action in the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 8 and the Paris Agreement 9 in relation to climate mitigation, adaptation and the provision of the means of implementation, especially finance to developing countries. We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 10 including, inter alia, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, as set out in principle 7 thereof. We gather here in Doha at a summit of renewed hope, driven by commitment and collective action. While facing urgent and complex challenges, we see new opportunities. We are convinced that meaningful progress is possible through genuine solidarity, effective multilateralism and inclusive international cooperation, taking into account national realities and regional contexts, particularly in developing countries. We remain committed to a political, economic, ethical and spiritual vision for social development that is based on human dignity, human rights, equality, respect, peace, democracy, mutual responsibility and cooperation, and full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people. We welcome the progress made towards the full implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action through concerted action at the national, regional and global levels. The global wealth of nations has grown significantly since 1995 and international trade has grown even more. Global labour productivity has increased, and the global unemployment rate has reached a historic low. Extreme poverty has been reduced and access to education, healthcare and social protection has improved considerably. Yet, 30 years after the convening of the World Summit for Social Development, progress remains slow and uneven, and major gaps and inequalities persist within and among countries. With only five years remaining until the 2030 deadline, progress towards achieving most of the Sustainable Development Goals has been far too slow, with some goals stalled or even regressing despite notable advances in a few areas: (a) Although great strides have been made in reducing poverty since 1995, in recent years progress has slowed, and millions of people still live in extreme poverty and over 1 billion people endure poverty in different forms and dimensions. Children, women, persons with disabilities, people living in rural areas and those in vulnerable situations experience higher poverty rates than the rest of the population. Hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition are still a reality, with global undernourishment rising in recent years. While access to education has expanded, still too many children are out of school; (b) In addition, while millions have been lifted out of poverty, billions of people live close to the poverty line and face a constant risk of falling into extreme poverty. Despite significant global progress in gradually expanding social protection __________________ 8 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1771, No. 30822. 9 Adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

I, Resolutions Adopted by the Conference (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.93.I.8 and corrigendum), resolution 1, annex I. A/RES/80/5 Doha Political Declaration of the \u201cWorld Social Summit\u201d under the title \u201cthe Second World Summit for Social Development\u201d 25-17700 4/18 coverage, including social protection floors, almost 4 billion people still lack access to any form of social protection, including nearly 2 billion children; (c) Millions of workers continue to live in poverty, earning wages and incomes that are not sufficient for an adequate standard of living or to sustain their families. Informal employment remains pervasive, with billions of people making their living in the informal economy. Women and young people are disproportionately engaged in informal and precarious employment. Furthermore, progress towards ending child labour is too slow; (d) Millions of youth do not have access to education, employment or training, the majority of whom are young women. In the labour market, young people, especially youth with disabilities, experience higher levels of unemployment, informal employment and working poverty. These decent work deficits can have long- lasting consequences on poverty eradication efforts and affect the well-being of current and future generations; (e) Today, inequality has reached staggering levels. Since 1995, income inequality has increased in many countries, developed and developing. Global wage gaps remain significant. Gender inequality is deeply entrenched. On average, women earn less than men and millions of women worldwide are outside the labour force; (f) Persons with disabilities continue to be more likely to live in poverty, are underemployed and unemployed, and face additional disability-related costs, including medical costs, as well as other significant and persistent social and economic barriers to inclusion in society; (g) Digital divides within and among countries persist, particularly in rural and remote areas. Billions of people currently do not have connectivity, access to the Internet and lack digital skills. Digital infrastructure, connectivity and access to the Internet in developing countries, particularly least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, remain challenging; (h) Multiple, persistent and new challenges are reversing social development gains, including geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, economic crises, inequalities within and among countries, climate change, natural hazards and disasters, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, water scarcity, desertification, pollution, conflict-induced famine and starvation, humanitarian emergencies and forced displacement of people, refugee crisis, pandemics and other health emergencies, gender inequality, racial discrimination, uneven technological advancements, unsustainable debt burdens and unequal access to technology and capital; (i) Complex and interrelated opportunities, challenges and risks related to demographic shifts remain, including rapid population growth, declining birth rates and population ageing. Between 2024 and 2030, the number of persons aged 60 years or over is globally projected to outnumber youth, and this increase will be the greatest and the most rapid in the developing world. While these problems are global in character and affect all countries, we clearly acknowledge that each country faces specific challenges in its pursuit of sustainable development. We recognize the special challenges facing all developing countries, in particular, African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, as well as the specific challenges facing middle-income countries and countries in conflict and post-conflict situations. We commit to support and implement the relevant development agendas, strategies and programmes of action for countries in special situations, including the Doha Political Declaration of the \u201cWorld Social Summit\u201d under the title \u201cthe Second World Summit for Social Development\u201d A/RES/80/5 5/18 25-17700 Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries, 11 the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024\u2013 203412 and the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for Small Island Developing States, 13 and reaffirm our support for the achievement of the African Union Agenda 2063. We look forward to the elaboration of a specific inter-agency, comprehensive, system- wide response plan for middle-income countries by the United Nations development system. We are convinced that addressing today\u2019s challenges to social development requires strengthening international solidarity, upholding human rights, building trust, and a renewed commitment to multilateral action on the attainment of social development and the implementation of the sustainable development agenda in its social, economic and environmental dimensions. We will advance innovative solutions and inclusive international cooperation to fully translate the commitments of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action and the social dimension of the 2030 Agenda into concrete actions to achieve social development for all, in particular to the benefit of developing countries. We reaffirm that the Commission for Social Development has the primary responsibility for the follow-up to the Summit and review of the implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action. We recognize that the multilateral system and its institutions, with the United Nations and its Charter at the centre, must be strengthened to keep pace with a changing world and address global challenges in the sphere of social development. They must be fit for the present and the future \u2013 effective and capable, just, democratic, equitable and representative of today\u2019s world, inclusive, interconnected and financially stable. We will explore bold and effective social policies that are woven into a whole- of-government, whole-of-society, people-centred and integrated approaches aimed at achieving social development for all, including through enhancing social policy coherence, building effective, accountable, transparent and inclusive institutions at all levels, achieving social justice for all, upholding democracy, the rule of law, good governance and access to justice, combating all forms of corruption and reinforcing national coordination, as well as multi-stakeholder engagement and integrated responses to social development challenges, and avoiding policy silos across sectors. We recognize the contributions of multi-stakeholder engagement to social development. We will continue to collaborate meaningfully with all relevant stakeholders, including civil society, social partners and the private sector, and encourage multi-stakeholder collaboration and partnerships. On the basis of our common pursuit of social development, which is aimed at social justice, solidarity, harmony and equality, within and among countries, guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, as well as policy objectives, development priorities and religious and cultural diversity, and full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms, we reaffirm our global drive for social progress and development. We strive for a future that is inclusive, resilient, sustainable and just. We envisage a world free of poverty, hunger, unemployment, preventable diseases, racism, discrimination and insecurity and a world of equality, equity, shared __________________ 11 Resolution 76/258, annex. 12 Resolution 79/233, annex; see also resolution 79/279. 13 Resolution 78/317, annex.

A call to action We recommit ourselves to creating an enabling economic, political, social, cultural and legal environment to achieve social development for all. We will adopt a holistic approach towards the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including through addressing the challenges of extreme poverty and multidimensional poverty, address their disproportionate impact on countries in special situations and people in vulnerable situations and combat the feminization of poverty while ensuring that the focus is on building resilience to shocks and challenges, accelerating actions to eradicate poverty and avoiding relapsing back into it. In this regard we commit to: (a) Taking effective measures, including policies and programmes, to address the root causes of poverty and underlying causes of inequality, providing for the basic needs of all and increasing resilience for interconnected crises.

We recall and reaffirm our commitments to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,4 recognizing its integrated and indivisible nature and acknowledging _______________ 1 Resolution 64/293. 2 Resolution 72/1. 3 Resolution 76/7, annex. 4 Resolution 70/1. A/RES/80/9 2025 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons 25-19346 2/8 that the 2030 Agenda includes commitments that relate to combating all forms of trafficking in persons, recognize the importance of partnerships and international cooperation in this regard, and emphasize that the 2030 Agenda and the Global Plan of Action are mutually reinforcing. We also welcome the actions and efforts related to ending trafficking in persons, especially of women and children, contained in resolution 79/1 entitled \u201cThe Pact for the Future\u201d. We reaffirm the crucial importance of universal ratification of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 5 and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,6 taking into consideration the central role of those instruments in the fight against trafficking in persons, and urge Member States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to the Convention and the Protocol as a matter of priority. We urge States Parties to those instruments to implement them effectively, including through the Mechanism for the Review of the Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto. We also reaffirm the importance of universal ratification and implementation of other relevant international instruments that address trafficking in persons, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child 7 and its optional protocols relevant to trafficking in persons.8 We recall the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, 9 the Global Compact on Refugees,10 and take note of Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women general recommendation No. 38 (2020) on trafficking in women and girls in the context of global migration.11 We also reaffirm our recognition of the definition of trafficking in persons as set forth in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, as referenced in the Global Plan of Action and the subsequent Political Declarations. We reiterate our strong condemnation of trafficking in persons, which constitutes a serious crime and a grave offence to human dignity and physical integrity, a violation and abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms and a challenge to sustainable development, and we note that respect for human rights is an important basis of comprehensive anti\u2011trafficking strategies. Combating trafficking in persons requires the implementation of a comprehensive approach that includes partnerships, international cooperation and measures to prevent trafficking, to identify and protect the victims, as well as a criminal justice response, including the investigation, prosecution and punishment of traffickers. In this regard, we encourage the development of policies, programmes and national strategies to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, we underline the importance of cooperation with civil society and we note the need to strengthen legal and institutional frameworks for more effective responses. _______________ 5 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2225, No. 39574. 6 Ibid., vol. 2237, No. 39574. 7 Ibid., vol. 1577, No. 27531. 8 Ibid., vols. 2171 and 2173, No. 27531. 9 Resolution 73/195, annex. 10 Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-third Session, Supplement No. 12 (A/73/12 (Part I) and A/73/12 (Part II)), part II. 11 CEDAW/C/GC/38. 2025 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons A/RES/80/9 3/8 25-19346 We commit to fulfil our obligations and intensify our efforts to prevent, address and eliminate the demand that fosters trafficking in persons, especially of women and children, for all forms of exploitation, and in this regard to put in place or enhance preventive measures, including legislative and other measures to deter exploiters, and those who facilitate or profit from the exploitation of trafficking victims, and hold them accountable. We reaffirm our commitment to address the social, economic, cultural, political and other factors that make people vulnerable to trafficking in persons, such as poverty, underdevelopment, unemployment, inequality, humanitarian emergencies, armed conflicts and natural disasters, sexual violence, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, social and financial exclusion and marginalization, as well as negative social norms, and a culture of tolerance towards violence against women, youth and children. We reiterate our commitment to promote education and awareness-raising campaigns to prevent trafficking in persons, and we welcome the designation of 30 July as the World Day against Trafficking in Persons.12 We express our serious concern over the significant and enduring trafficking of women and children, recognize that trafficking in persons disproportionately affects them. We note with concern potential cases of trafficking in women for the exploitation of surrogacy. We express grave concern about the increase in child trafficking, primarily for forced labour, forced marriage, sexual exploitation, and involvement in criminal activities. We note the specific vulnerabilities of children, including children and youth with disabilities and unaccompanied children, to various forms of exploitation, including in the context of travel, tourism and sports, and the need to address them, as well as the cultural practices that justify or tolerate their demand. We call upon Member States to enact or update national laws and establish comprehensive policies, programmes and other measures, as appropriate, that provide for the protection of trafficked women and children from revictimization and appropriate assistance and protection in the best interests of the child. We express solidarity with and compassion for victims and survivors, we call for full respect of their human rights and recognizing their role as agents of change in the global fight against trafficking in persons. We acknowledge the need to actively involve them, incorporating their perspective and experience in all efforts to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, including in designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating such efforts. We will provide victim-centred and trauma-informed care, assistance and services for their recovery and rehabilitation, access to health, including sexual and reproductive health-care services and mental health and psychosocial support services, and seek to enhance the provision of safe shelter, legal aid, long-term support, reintegration and timely family reunification, including protection and assistance, working also with civil society and other relevant partners. We will ensure that victims are treated with respect and dignity and are not inappropriately penalized or adversely affected by any actions taken by government authorities and communities, including criminal, civil, administrative and immigration penalties, for acts that they commit as a direct consequence of their trafficking situation, through the implementation of both the principle of non\u2011prosecution and non\u2011punishment of victims of trafficking subject to national laws, rules and regulations. We commit to undertake appropriate measures to facilitate access to justice and protections for victims of trafficking in persons that should not be conditional on their participation in criminal proceedings, taking into account national legislation, and we will seek to ensure that laws and policies are in place to alleviate reliance on victims\u2019 _______________ 12 See resolution 68/192. A/RES/80/9 2025 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons 25-19346 4/8 testimonies. We also commit to take steps to ensure that effective remedies are available, including for damage suffered, as well as for victims who have been unjustly penalized for illegal acts committed in connection with their victimization. We further commit to enable a victim-centred, age- and gender-sensitive approach to care and assistance of victims that takes into consideration disability and trauma and that addresses the specific needs of women, youth and children. We affirm our commitment to protect the privacy and identity and ensure the safety of victims of trafficking in persons before, during and after criminal proceedings, including when the victim\u2019s testimony is necessary in legal proceedings, and to protect immediate family members and witnesses, as appropriate, from retaliation by traffickers, by ensuring their safety, in accordance with articles 24 and 25 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, as applicable. We reaffirm our commitment to continue our efforts to criminalize trafficking in persons in all its forms, to hold traffickers accountable for their crimes through prosecutions, and to strengthen cooperation and coordination among Member States in countries of origin, transit and destination in order to disrupt and dismantle criminal networks involved in such crimes, inter alia through the enhancement of information- sharing, including through the secure communications channels of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), where appropriate, as well as through mutual legal assistance and extradition, with full respect for domestic law, in combating crimes that might be connected with trafficking in persons, such as money- laundering, corruption, illicit financial flows, the smuggling of migrants, the trafficking in illicit drugs, illicit arms trafficking, cybercrime and all forms of organized crime and related illicit finance. We commit to enhancing the capacity of law enforcement and criminal justice systems, including the capacity of criminal justice practitioners, to identify, investigate and prosecute cases of trafficking in persons, including when connected to other trafficking-related crimes, and analyse financial flows to detect and dismantle those criminal networks and their financial structures, in collaboration with financial institutions. We also commit to developing and strengthening national referral mechanisms and to use available technology to increase victim referrals and services and to identify, seize and forfeit proceeds of crime of those criminal networks. We emphasize the importance of regular and specialized professional training for officials and practitioners who are involved in preventing, identifying and responding to trafficking in persons, as a key component of an effective and victim-centred approach. We also commit to investigate and prosecute trafficking in persons, and to take all appropriate measures to collect, preserve and store evidence of human trafficking, including when committed for the purpose of, particularly, sexual exploitation. We recognize that trafficking-related crimes often encompass other criminal acts and call for the adoption of prosecutorial policies that ensure accountability for the full range of harm suffered by victims. We are seriously concerned that the scale of global resourcing to prevent and fight trafficking in persons does not match the scale of the challenge and in this regard: (a) We reaffirm our strong support for the United Nations voluntary trust fund for victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, established in accordance with the Global Plan of Action, and we invite all stakeholders to contribute to the trust fund, including through the announcement of pledges at the quadrennial high-level appraisals of the Global Plan of Action; 2025 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons A/RES/80/9 5/8 25-19346 (b) We evince our strong political will and commitment of financial resources to effectively address trafficking in persons in all circumstances, acknowledging the need to provide sufficient, reliable, sustainable and predictable resources for national trafficking in persons strategies, especially for developing countries that are particularly affected by mixed and large movements of refugees and migrants, including countries of origin, transit and destination; (c) We will endeavour to provide unearmarked extrabudgetary resources for the offices of the United Nations system which are mandated to combat trafficking in persons, consistent with their rules and procedures; (d) We stress the need to intensify international and regional cooperation, including capacity-building, exchange of best practices and know-how and technical assistance, especially for developing countries, aimed at strengthening their ability to prevent all forms of trafficking, address the special needs of victims, and to strengthen their criminal justice systems, noting the particular role of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in this regard; (e) We encourage relevant entities and bodies of the United Nations system to provide assistance to Member States for training and capacity-building, upon request, including gender- and age-sensitive and victim-centred mental health and psychosocial support services, that take into consideration disability, for the recovery and reintegration of victims; (f) We reaffirm the significant role of enhanced international cooperation in preventing and combating trafficking in persons, including in the area of mutual legal assistance and extradition. We reiterate, in the strongest terms possible, the importance of strengthening collective action by Member States to end trafficking in persons, including through regional, subregional and cross-regional mechanisms, and through partnerships and initiatives with the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders, including, inter alia, regional and international organizations, the private sector, the media, academia, parliamentarians and civil society, as well as national human rights institutions where they exist, in compliance with the Paris Principles. 13 We will promote multi-stakeholder partnerships and engage the private sector and civil society in developing and implementing relevant sustainable initiatives to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, recognizing the important role played by financial institutions. We underline the work of the Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and on contemporary forms of slavery, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, and other relevant special rapporteurs and representatives, in combating trafficking in persons, and welcome their continued efforts to implement the Global Plan of Action and the present Political Declaration. We also stress the need to continue to enhance the overall organization and coherence in the global efforts of the United Nations system to respond to trafficking in persons, especially in ensuring support to Member States. In this regard, while recalling the mandate of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons, we urge the Secretary-General to continue efforts to strengthen coordination within the United Nations system and to inform Member States thereof through existing reporting channels. We recognize the important role played by the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons in the United Nations system, with the United Nations _______________ 13 Resolution 48/134, annex. A/RES/80/9 2025 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons 25-19346 6/8 Office on Drugs and Crime as its coordinator, and recognize with appreciation the ongoing efforts of its member entities in this regard. We invite the Coordination Group to continue to increase its activities related to the implementation of the Global Plan of Action and, to that end, to incorporate aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development relevant to preventing and combating trafficking in persons and to continue to advance the coordination of future activities and avoidance of duplication of efforts. We encourage the Coordination Group to continue to expand its membership to include international intergovernmental entities that have a role in addressing trafficking in persons in all regions. We reaffirm the central role of the work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the global fight against trafficking in persons, particularly in providing technical assistance to Member States, upon their request, to implement the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, by making use of existing capacity-building tools, lessons learned from Member States and expertise available in other international organizations. We reiterate the need for improved data collection and analysis of trafficking in persons, disaggregated by sex, age, disability and other relevant factors, including the form of exploitation, and using systematic and consistent criteria, to effectively counter trafficking in persons. We thus recognize the importance of improved data collection by national authorities and will enhance international cooperation to this end, including through capacity-building, financial support and technical assistance, consistent with our national legislation on data protection, if applicable, and our respective international obligations related to privacy. We acknowledge the importance of the biennial Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, prepared by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime pursuant to the Global Plan of Action, and request the Office to continue to collect information on patterns, forms and flows of trafficking in persons, at the national, regional and international levels, in a balanced, reliable and comprehensive manner, to be published in the Global Report, and in ongoing research to estimate the prevalence of trafficking in persons, in close cooperation and collaboration with Member States. We underline that the issue of trafficking in persons in situations of armed conflict, natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies requires further attention, while fully respecting the principles of humanitarian assistance. In this regard: (a) We recognize that refugees and migrants in large movements face greater risk of trafficking in persons, thus we will work to prevent trafficking among those affected by displacement, and provide support with targeted measures to identify victims or those at risk of trafficking in places of first arrival as well as throughout their journey, through the development of age- and gender-responsive policies and programmes. We also commit to intensify our efforts to prevent irregular migration and create and strengthen pathways for safe, orderly and regular migration to reduce the exposure of people on the move to trafficking in persons, recalling our respective commitments to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration; (b) We encourage the training of humanitarian and peacekeeping personnel to be deployed in humanitarian emergencies and peacekeeping operations on responding to trafficking in persons, child protection and sexual exploitation and abuse, and encourage relevant entities and bodies of the United Nations system to train their personnel, build their technical capacity to assess situations and respond to instances of trafficking in persons in these contexts. We express our deep concern about the increasing links between armed groups, including terrorist groups, and trafficking in persons, involving the coercion of 2025 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons A/RES/80/9 7/8 25-19346 victims, in particular of women and girls, into forced marriages, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, forced labour, domestic servitude and sexual exploitation, and subjecting men and boys to forced labour or act as combatants. We note with concern the increasing misuse of information and communications technologies, in particular the Internet, to facilitate various aspects of trafficking in persons, including the recruitment of individuals through online advertisements for online fraud and scam operations, and with the use of generative artificial intelligence, thereby subjecting victims to forced criminality, debt bondage and a range of abusive practices, as well as various forms of exploitations, including online child sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, emphasizing the disproportionate risk faced by persons with disabilities and the need to strengthen digital literacy as a preventive measure. We also emphasize the importance of countering such misuse while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with our obligations under international law. In this regard: (a) We take note of the adoption of the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime; Strengthening International Cooperation for Combating Certain Crimes Committed by Means of Information and Communications Technology Systems and for the Sharing of Evidence in Electronic Form of Serious Crimes;14 (b) We call for the strengthening of law enforcement digital expertise and capacity to conduct proportionate, lawful, accountable and necessary investigations in cyberspace, including the dark web, and seize associated electronic evidence. We encourage the appropriate use by law enforcement of technology-based solutions that address the global scope of trafficking in persons; (c) We express deep concern about the growing misuse of artificial intelligence or machine-learning technologies to generate, disseminate hate speech for the purpose of trafficking in persons, including on social media platforms, through, inter alia, the use of artificial content, including images, videos and other forms of media, while also recognizing the potential of such technologies to detect and mitigate harmful content when developed and deployed safely; (d) We further encourage the appropriate use of technology and innovative tools by practitioners and central authorities to increase international and, where relevant, cross-border cooperation in criminal matters, recognizing the need for the ethical use of technology consistent with human rights obligations; (e) We call for effective partnerships among the public sector, civil society, academia and the private sector, including technology companies, to enhance innovation, cooperation and the use of technology, including artificial intelligence, to combat trafficking in persons. We emphasize the particularly important role played by Internet service and access providers, and call upon them to fulfil their responsibilities and promptly detect, report and remove sexual exploitation and abuse materials related to trafficking in persons, while we commit to taking legislative and other measures to facilitate these actions. We reaffirm that the crime of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal constitutes a form of exploitation and an offence against the human dignity of the victims that needs a multidisciplinary approach, based on respect for all human rights. We condemn the involvement of criminal groups and unethical medical personnel in trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal, and we call for better coordination and collaboration between criminal justice actors and medical professionals. We commit to adopting ethical and transparent regulations governing organ donations, strengthening legislative frameworks, including the criminalization _______________ 14 Resolution 79/243, annex. A/RES/80/9 2025 Political Declaration on the Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons 25-19346 8/8 of these practices and provisions to ensure the accountability of the perpetrators, and to resourcing such efforts. We also reaffirm the importance of preventing and combating trafficking in persons in supply chains, including by deterring and penalizing fraudulent and abusive recruitment practices. We encourage Member States, multilateral organizations and the private sector to adopt ethical and transparent practices in their procurement and supply chains, and strongly urge them to regularly disclose and provide relevant information. We are mindful of the need to ensure that all actors in global supply chains, including intermediaries, who profit from the labour of trafficking victims are to be held accountable, including through sufficiently stringent sanctions and appropriate policy and legislation. In this regard, we recall the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.15 We stress the need to establish firewalls between immigration checks and labour inspections, to implement labour standards and to improve government procurement practices to promote decent work. We emphasize the importance of awareness and education campaigns, in partnership with civil society and the media, to combat acceptance of forced labour. We also urge the Secretary-General to ensure that all United Nations procurement does not contain goods and services produced by victims of human trafficking. We acknowledge that the gaps between the Global Plan of Action and its implementation by Member States should be closed, and recognize that arrangements are needed to ensure the systematic follow-up to and review of all of the commitments we are making at the present high-level meeting, including in the quadrennial high- level meetings of the General Assembly to appraise progress achieved in the implementation of the Global Plan of Action. We will also promote the development of clearer analysis of successful counter-trafficking responses, and assessment and evaluation frameworks that include consideration of how laws, policies or practical measures affect victims of trafficking in persons. _______________ 15 Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d Framework (A/HRC/17/31, annex).", "signals": ["PGA"], "num_paragraphs": 31}, {"symbol": "A/RES/80/10", "filename": "A_RES_80_10.html", "content": "Decides to proclaim 5 September of each year as the International Day of the World\u2019s Indigenous Women and Girls; Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all States Members of the United Nations, members of the specialized agencies and observers of the General Assembly, as well as the organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders, for appropriate observance of the International Day of the World\u2019s Indigenous Women and Girls, in order to raise awareness of the need to recognize and respect the rights and fundamental freedoms of all Indigenous women and girls, as set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and to support their pursuit of economic, social and cultural development; _______________ 11 Resolution 70/1. 12 CEDAW/C/GC/39. 13 CEDAW/C/GC/40.

Recognize that noncommunicable diseases and mental health and well- being are closely intertwined with brain health and neurological conditions, that mental health conditions and neurological conditions contribute to the global incidence and impact of noncommunicable diseases and that persons living with mental health conditions and neurological conditions also have an increased risk of other noncommunicable diseases and therefore have higher rates of morbidity and mortality; Recognize also that the main modifiable risk factors of noncommunicable diseases are tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity and air pollution and are largely preventable and require cross-sectoral actions; Emphasize with concern that, globally, there are: (a) 1.3 billion tobacco users and more than 7 million tobacco-related deaths each year, including an estimated 1.6 million non\u2011smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke; (b) 2.6 million deaths each year attributable to alcohol consumption; (c) 35 million children under 5 years of age currently overweight; (d) 390 million children 5 to 19 years old who are overweight or obese, while adult obesity has more than doubled since 1990; and (e) nearly 7 million deaths each year caused by air pollution, with 99 per cent of the population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels; Emphasize that noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions prevent people and communities from reaching their full potential, pose a heavy economic burden, limit human capital development, can undermine the sustainability of health systems and, together with other health conditions, compound cycles of poverty and disadvantage; Recognize that the human and economic cost of noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions contributes to poverty and inequalities and threatens the health of peoples and the development of countries, and that there are public health risks associated with increased urbanization, including unhealthy diets, malnutrition and hunger, sedentary lifestyles and physical inactivity, requiring commitments to mobilize and allocate adequate, predictable and sustained resources for national responses to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases, including through international cooperation and official development assistance; Recognize also that noncommunicable diseases, mental health conditions and their underlying risk factors and determinants affect people at all ages, including children and young people; Recognize further the increasing gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy for older persons and note that, despite the progress achieved at the A/RES/80/117 Political declaration of the fourth high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases and the promotion of mental health and well-being 25-20712 4/14 global level, many health systems continue to be inadequately prepared to identify and respond to the growing needs of the rapidly ageing population, including the increased prevalence of noncommunicable diseases; Acknowledge that mainstreaming a gender perspective into the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases is crucial to understanding and addressing health risks and needs of women and men of all ages, giving particular attention to the impact of noncommunicable diseases on women in all settings; Recognize that, globally, women comprise approximately 70 per cent of the health workforce, and further recognize that women face a double noncommunicable disease burden, often acting as caregivers for the sick and facing other structural barriers that hinder timely noncommunicable disease prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment; Recognize that persons with disabilities are at increased risk of noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions and often face disproportionate discrimination, stigma and exclusion from accessing health services, and that noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions are leading causes of years lived with a disability; Recognize also that the poorest, the socioeconomically disadvantaged and those in vulnerable situations, including those in conflict, emergency and humanitarian settings, and those living in areas most vulnerable to climate change, often bear a disproportionate burden of noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions, that there are unique vulnerabilities for people living in developing countries, including in small island developing States, where noncommunicable diseases are increasingly becoming the main cause of mortality, and that small island developing States have among the highest rates of obesity worldwide and are disproportionately represented among the countries with the highest risk of dying prematurely from noncommunicable diseases; Recognize further that, since the adoption of the political declaration in 2018, issues such as the coronavirus disease (COVID\u201119) pandemic, humanitarian emergencies, natural disasters and extreme weather events, conflicts, increasing debt challenges and other intersected crises have strained macroeconomic conditions and fiscal capacity, especially for developing countries, and directly impacted health and well-being and introduced additional pressures on national responses to noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions; Recognize that the COVID\u201119 pandemic disproportionately impacted people living with noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions and that many health systems were heavily disrupted and not adequately prepared to effectively respond to these conditions during the pandemic, demonstrating the importance of investing in resilient health systems and healthy populations; Recognize the threat and challenge posed by antimicrobial resistance in the treatment of certain noncommunicable diseases, such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, and the need for integrated policies and strategies that promote disease prevention and safeguard the reliable access, stewardship and effectiveness of antimicrobials across health systems aligning, as appropriate, with the global action plan on antimicrobial resistance;

Recognize further the fundamental role of primary health care in achieving universal health coverage, as was declared in the Declaration of Alma-Ata of 1978 and the Declaration of Astana on primary health care of 2018, and further reaffirm the importance of primary health care as an effective and efficient approach to enhancing people\u2019s physical and mental health, as well as social well-being, noting the need to unite efforts through the global coalition on primary health care to take coordinated action in delivering high-quality, safe, integrated and accessible health services at the primary care level, including in remote geographical regions or in areas difficult to access; Reaffirm the importance of national ownership and the primary role and responsibility of governments at all levels to determine their own path in responding to the challenge of noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions, underscore the importance of pursuing whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches, and acknowledge that all stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector and people living with noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions, play a role and can contribute to creating an environment conducive to preventing and controlling noncommunicable diseases and promoting mental health and well-being, and mobilizing all available resources, as appropriate, for the implementation of national responses; Recognize the importance of fully respecting human rights, including the rights of Indigenous Peoples, in line with national contexts, in the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases and the promotion of mental health and well- being, and ensuring that no one is left behind, including for access to services and care, acknowledging that people living with and at risk of these conditions are often unjustly deprived of such access and may encounter discrimination and inconsiderate treatment; Recognize also that people living with noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions, their families and caregivers have unique experiences and have first-hand expertise to contribute to designing, implementing and monitoring health promotion, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care (including rehabilitation and palliation) policies and programmes; Acknowledge that there are cost-effective and evidence-based interventions for preventing, screening, diagnosing, treating and caring for people living with or at elevated risk of noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions, while also acknowledging that scarce resources and increasing prices of certain health products and services mean that Member States must prioritize the most affordable and feasible interventions, which, for the most part, can be delivered at community and primary health care level based on context-specific considerations; Recognize the value of high-quality research and evidence to inform effective and innovative prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions, while noting with concern that access to the benefits of research and innovation, such as quality, safe, efficacious and affordable diagnostics and treatment, remains challenging, especially for developing countries; Acknowledge that investing, as appropriate, in the World Health Organization \u201cbest buys\u201d aims to save close to 7 million lives, resulting in 50 million additional years of healthy life, and that these outcomes can be achieved with a return A/RES/80/117 Political declaration of the fourth high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases and the promotion of mental health and well-being 25-20712 6/14 on investment of at least 7 United States dollars by 2030 for every dollar spent, resulting in more than 230 billion dollars in economic benefits between now and 2030; Emphasize the importance of addressing the digital divide in health, between and within countries, to facilitate access to digital health technologies to address noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions and prevent the exacerbation of health inequities, and in this regard acknowledge the pressing need to address the major impediments that countries, particularly developing countries, face in accessing and developing digital technologies, and highlight the importance of financing and capacity-building;

Recognize further that breastfeeding fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development and has longer-term health benefits for both child and mother such as reducing the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing noncommunicable diseases later in life; Recognize also that obesity is driven by multiple factors, including the unaffordability and unavailability of healthy diets, lack of physical activity, sleep deprivation and stress; Emphasize the need to prioritize affordable and evidenced-based actions to fast-track progress in the next five years that build on demonstrative successes in countries and maximize return on investment, and that data and indicators are essential to monitor progress; Recognize that multimorbidity and co-occurrence with diseases, including infectious, vaccine-preventable and rare diseases, increases the complexity of early diagnosis and treatment of noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions; Recognize also that oral diseases are a major health and economic burden in many countries and impact people across their lifetime, causing pain, discomfort, disfigurement and even death, that untreated dental caries (tooth decay) in permanent teeth is among the most common health conditions, and that oral diseases are largely preventable and caused by a range of modifiable risk factors, requiring a continuing focus on social, environmental and population strategies, and can contribute to other noncommunicable diseases; Recognize further that leadership, political commitment, action, cooperation and coordination beyond the health sector are important to promote and accelerate cost-effective, accessible and affordable population-level interventions to promote healthy lifestyles and to prevent noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions;

Businesses have the primary responsibility to ensure that products they make available to consumers are safe. Businesses take safety into account in the design, quality assurance, production and supply of consumer products throughout their entire life cycle. II. Product safety regulation and standards Member States should empower the relevant authorities responsible for product safety to develop laws, rules, regulations and policies, participate in and encourage the development of standards and consider existing standards, for the safety of products. Member States should develop policies to strengthen product safety online, engaging actors involved in the online sale of products, including online A/RES/80/119 Consumer product safety 25-20734 4/8 marketplaces, by ensuring that they implement appropriate measures to enhance consumer product safety. Member States should formulate or promote the development and implementation of standards for the safety of products at the regional and international levels. The fact that a product formally complied with product safety requirements should not preclude the relevant authorities responsible for product safety from taking all appropriate corrective measures where there is evidence that the product is unsafe. Member States should perform outreach activities to industry regarding applicable product safety requirements to help businesses to comply with product safety requirements. Member States should encourage the availability of testing and certification facilities, including at the bilateral and regional levels. Instruments laying down mandatory product safety requirements should be readily available to the public. III. Responsibilities of relevant authorities responsible for product safety Member States should empower the relevant authorities responsible for product safety to investigate and take action against unsafe products and the businesses in the supply chain that bring them to market. These powers may include the following: (a) Mandate businesses to report to the relevant authorities responsible for product safety incidents associated with a product that they have made available to consumers, without undue delay from the moment they become aware of the incident; (b) Request businesses to notify the relevant authorities responsible for product safety of any unsafe product that they have made available to consumers, without undue delay from the moment they know about the risk. Product safety incidents and regulatory notifications should be documented, including the time of awareness and the time of notification; (c) Require businesses to provide in their reports and notifications to the relevant authorities responsible for product safety complete information with respect to the safety aspects, including potential risks, and to the supply chain of their products; (d) Order businesses to take certain measures, such as those enumerated in section VI on corrective measures, in relation to a product presenting a danger to consumers\u2019 health and safety; (e) Receive and process complaints from businesses, consumers, consumer groups, civil society and other government authorities in relation to a product presenting a danger; (f) Investigate and take action to stop the sale and distribution of products presenting a danger to consumers\u2019 health and safety in online marketplaces; (g) Any other power deemed necessary for the effective protection of consumers from unsafe products.

A/RES/80/119 Consumer product safety 25-20734 6/8 VI. Corrective measures Where a product made available to consumers appears to be unsafe, businesses should take appropriate and timely corrective measures to ensure that the product no longer poses a risk and coordinate with the relevant authority in this regard. In cases where businesses do not act upon an unsafe product or the corrective measures taken by them are considered unsatisfactory by the relevant authority responsible for product safety, such an authority should have the power to order corrective measures to ensure that the product no longer poses a risk. Measures, adopted by businesses or ordered by the relevant authority responsible for product safety, may include one or more of the following, whichever is most appropriate to the risk presented: (a) Notification of consumers of the risks in an accessible, accurate, clear and efficient manner; (b) Marking of the product with appropriate warnings of the risk or warning consumers of the risk; (c) The prompt withdrawal of the product from the market; (d) A recall of the product from consumers; (e) The destruction of the product; (f) The removal of the product listing by online marketplaces; (g) Product repair if possible and allowed by relevant legislation, particularly when the risk relates to a part of the product.

In the event of a product safety recall initiated by a business or ordered by the relevant authority responsible for product safety, the business responsible for the product safety recall should offer an effective, cost-free and timely remedy, such as repair, replacement or an adequate refund of the recalled product, to the consumer. VII. Information to consumers by relevant authorities responsible for product safety and by businesses Member States should develop a system to effectively and in a timely fashion communicate recalls and information on unsafe products, enabling consumers to identify the product and understand the nature of the risk and the measures taken. Member States should involve stakeholders in disseminating product safety information. Member States should provide consumers with a channel to reach out to the relevant authorities responsible for product safety on questions related to product safety matters or to report safety issues. Consumer product safety A/RES/80/119 7/8 25-20734 Businesses should provide consumers with information on the safe use of their products in a clear and accessible way, taking into account the widest possible range of consumers and paying particular attention to the needs of the vulnerable and disadvantaged. Such information on the safe use of products should equally be provided for online offers. To address sustainability and circular economy considerations, businesses should freely distribute and make available user manuals pertinent to the safe use of products to any interested party, including in electronic format or in another format adequate to consumers\u2019 needs. Businesses should provide consumers with channels through which to report product safety issues and incidents. Businesses should clearly inform consumers of actions to take when a product that they have placed on the market presents a danger to consumers\u2019 health and safety or after an incident has occurred that is linked to the use of the product. When a product is recalled, businesses should use information at their disposal to directly contact consumers affected by the recall. In addition, businesses should disseminate the recall notice as widely as possible through various media. Member States should, and businesses are encouraged to, develop, as appropriate, consumer education and awareness-raising programmes on product safety, disseminating them through effective channels of communication. VIII. Cooperation between businesses and relevant authorities responsible for product safety Businesses should cooperate with the relevant authorities responsible for product safety regarding actions to eliminate or mitigate risks that are presented by the products that they have made available on the market. Member States should facilitate and monitor the recall process, for example, by assisting businesses with recall notice wording. Member States should support voluntary initiatives by businesses, going beyond the legal obligations in place, to improve the safety of products. Member States should foster opportunities to bring all stakeholders together, including business organizations, consumer organizations and the relevant authorities responsible for product safety, to discuss product safety issues. They should share data on risks, exchange updates on safety guidelines and coordinate joint responses to safety concerns. Businesses should implement equivalent levels of consumer product safety irrespective of the country in which they operate. IX.

External debt sustainability and development A/RES/80/123 7/13 25-20754 Encourages the United Nations system, the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund and other relevant stakeholders, including the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to continue to conduct analytical activities and to provide policy advice and technical assistance to Governments, upon request, in the areas of managing debt, and operating and maintaining databases, and in this regard recalls that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development should continue its analytical and policy work and technical assistance on debt issues, including the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System Programme, so that this extends not only to improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of debt data recording, but also to the enhanced coverage of public sector and other relevant debt data, including, in particular, heretofore unrecorded or hidden debt instruments, contingent liabilities and more complex debt instruments; Stresses the need to strengthen information-sharing and transparency among all creditors and borrowers to ensure that debt sustainability assessments are based on comprehensive, objective and reliable data, including an assessment of national public and private debt, in order to ensure the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, encourages further improvement of the mutual exchange of information, on a voluntary basis, on borrowing and lending among all creditors and borrowers, and takes note of the Paris Forum initiative, which gathers together sovereign creditors and debtors annually to share views and information, promote greater debt transparency and preserve debt sustainability; Recognizes that the long-term sustainability of debt depends on, inter alia, economic growth, the mobilization of domestic and international resources, the export prospects of debtor countries, sustainable debt management, sound macroeconomic policies that also support job creation, transparent and effective regulatory frameworks and success in overcoming structural development problems and, hence, on the creation of an enabling environment at all levels that is conducive to sustainable development, and also recognizes the need to assist developing countries in attaining long-term debt sustainability, through coordinated policies aimed at fostering adequate debt financing and resolution tools, such as debt relief and debt restructuring supporting sound debt management; Notes with concern that some low- and middle-income developing countries that were not part of the existing debt relief initiatives now have large debt burdens that may create constraints on mobilizing the resources needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, indicating a need to consider, as appropriate, stronger debt management initiatives for those countries, and stresses the importance of medium- and long-term debt sustainability to deal with debt, including non\u2011Paris Club debt; Underlines the fact that heavily indebted poor countries eligible for debt relief will not be able to enjoy the full benefits unless all creditors, both public and private, contribute to debt workouts, as appropriate, in order to ensure the debt sustainability of those countries to further support their efforts to achieve sustainable development, and invites creditors, both private and public, that are not yet fully participating in debt relief initiatives to substantially increase their participation, including by providing comparable treatment to debtor countries that have concluded sustainable debt relief agreements with creditors; Stresses the need for the international community to remain vigilant in monitoring the debt situation of developing countries, including the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, and to continue to take effective measures, preferably within existing frameworks, when applicable, to address the debt problem of those countries, acknowledges that sound A/RES/80/123 External debt sustainability and development 25-20754 8/13 debt management initiatives can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, and with the promotion of sustained economic growth and development and the internationally agreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, and in this regard urges countries to direct the resources freed through debt relief, for example, through debt restructuring, cancellation and reduction, as appropriate, towards achieving those objectives, while still maintaining sustainable debt levels through prudent fiscal management, including in the context of the 2030 Agenda, according to their national priorities and strategies;

Acknowledges the efforts of, and invites creditors to provide additional flexibility to, developing countries affected by natural disasters so as to allow them to address their national debt concerns, while taking into account their specific economic and social situations and needs; Recognizes that the detrimental impact of disasters on the debt sustainability of many least developed countries, small island developing States and middle-income countries warrants further attention and that preserving external debt sustainability requires ex ante financing to enable the systematic reduction of disaster risk and resilience-building, as well as the disclosure of disaster risk to avoid exacerbating debt distress, when feasible, and in this regard recognizes that many least developed countries, small island developing States and middle-income countries have limited access to financing to invest in disaster risk reduction for resilience before and after disasters, while noting the potential benefits of climate- resilient debt instruments; Welcomes the promotion of the use of state-contingent clauses in official lending, including climate-resilient debt clauses and debt pause clauses, where appropriate, to ensure the possibility of debt service suspension during times of crises, disasters and shocks that are not covered by standard force majeure clauses, and to enhance the fiscal resilience of developing countries vulnerable to external shocks, and encourages the use of such clauses in commercial loan and debt contracts, where appropriate, in consultation with borrowing countries, and building on the work of the Group of 20 and the progress made by international financial institutions, invites the relevant international financial institutions to implement solutions to help to incorporate state-contingent clauses into commercial debt contracts, such as through reinsurance, and encourages support for this work; Recognizes that, in some cases, the use of public debt and renewed external borrowing to absorb the impact of a disaster could lead to higher debt servicing for developing countries and constrain their growth and their capacity to invest in long- term resilience-building measures, and further acknowledges that, with each new disaster, financial vulnerabilities grow and domestic response capacities weaken; Also recognizes the importance of the creation of robust, nationally appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks for sustainable national and municipal borrowing, on the basis of sustainable debt management, supported by adequate revenue and capacities, by means of local creditworthiness, as well as expanded sustainable municipal debt markets, when appropriate, and in this regard underlines the importance of the establishment of appropriate financial intermediaries for urban financing, such as regional, national, subnational and local development funds or External debt sustainability and development A/RES/80/123 9/13 25-20754 development banks, including pooled financing mechanisms, which can catalyse public and private, national and international financing; Further recognizes that developing countries experiencing high debt distress can concurrently experience socioeconomic challenges and stretched social safety nets, and invites a multilateral response that supports these countries to achieve debt sustainability and sustainable development; Underlines the importance of multilateral efforts to tackle increasingly complex cross-border challenges that have serious effects on development and debt sustainability; Recognizes with appreciation the steps taken by the Group of 20, in particular under the presidencies of Saudi Arabia, Italy, Indonesia, India, Brazil and South Africa to further promote debt-related measures and the implementation of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative and the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative, and the recent agreements concluded under the Common Framework, and calls to implement it fully in a transparent, predictable, timely, orderly and coordinated manner, including to increase the fiscal space of countries in debt distress, encourages greater private sector participation through more clarity in assessing comparability of treatment, while also noting that more needs to be done to respond to the need of countries not covered by current initiatives, including middle-income countries, and in this regard reaffirms the growing urgency of dealing not only with liquidity but also solvency risks; Further recognizes with appreciation the steps taken by the Group of 20 to provide additional clarity on the processes and enhance the implementation of the Common Framework; Acknowledges the importance of coordinated and enhanced liquidity and debt management support to developing countries committed to their ambitious development objectives, expresses appreciation for ongoing efforts in this area, including the three-pillar approach proposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to help to address debt service challenges, as well as other efforts made by the international community, and calls for further strengthening and systematizing this support through an institutional home within an existing facility, for example in the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund, that is accessible to all developing countries; Welcomes the special drawing rights allocation of the equivalent of 650 billion United States dollars of 23 August 2021, commends the achievement of the target of 100 billion dollars in pledges for rechannelling special drawing rights or equivalent contributions, recommends the exploration of further voluntary options related to special drawing rights that could serve the needs of developing member countries of the International Monetary Fund, calls for the urgent voluntary rechannelling of special drawing rights for countries most in need, including through multilateral development banks, while respecting relevant legal frameworks and preserving the reserve asset character of special drawing rights, and will explore ways for future allocations of special drawing rights to benefit those countries most in need; Takes note of the interim review of the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, and looks forward to a more comprehensive review planned for 2026; Recommends assisting developing countries in attaining long-term debt sustainability through coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief, debt restructuring and sound debt management, as appropriate, to enhance the ability of countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; A/RES/80/123 External debt sustainability and development 25-20754 10/13 Also recommends the facilitation of timely and orderly debt treatment with the broad participation of all creditors, including those in the private sector, on comparable terms, stresses the need in the medium term to strengthen information- sharing between debtors and creditors, as necessary, and long-term debt sustainability analysis, based on comprehensive, objective, transparent and reliable data, and technical cooperation that takes account of the requirements of sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda, and emphasizes the urgency of strengthening international efforts and cooperation and responding to the call for the easing of debt burdens by addressing the debt vulnerability, in the immediate term, and the debt sustainability, in the long term, of heavily indebted developing countries;

Takes note of the International Monetary Fund Executive Board decision in October 2024 for the review of charges and the surcharge policy, and the setting of a regular review cycle for the surcharge policy to allow for timely assessments and updates to the surcharge policy framework, every five years or earlier if warranted; Recognizes the important role of credit ratings in the capital market ecosystem, as they provide creditors and the public with assessments of a debtor\u2019s relative risk of default, and acknowledges that downgraded ratings may negatively affect the opinion of lenders and bondholders and as a result raise the cost and reduce the availability of future debt funding, and that it is important that credit rating agencies ensure that their ratings are objective, independent and based on accurate information and sound analytical methods, including by considering development, social and environmental indicators and impacts of external shocks in their ratings, to the extent that these factors have an impact on debt risk, noting in this regard the high- level meeting on the role of credit rating agencies in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda; Reiterates that debtors and creditors must work together in a transparent manner to prevent and resolve unsustainable debt situations and that maintaining sustainable debt levels is the responsibility of the borrowing countries, acknowledges that lenders also have a responsibility to lend in a way that does not undermine a country\u2019s debt sustainability, and in this regard takes note of the principles on responsible sovereign lending and borrowing of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, recognizes the applicable requirements of the debt limits policy of the International Monetary Fund and/or the non\u2011concessional borrowing policy of the World Bank and the safeguards of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in its statistical system to enhance the debt sustainability of recipient countries, and resolves to work towards a global consensus on guidelines for debtor and creditor responsibilities in borrowing by and lending to sovereigns, building on existing initiatives; Calls for the intensification of efforts to prevent and mitigate the prevalence and cost of debt crises by enhancing international financial mechanisms for crisis prevention and resolution, encourages the private sector to cooperate in this regard, and invites creditors and debtors to further explore, where appropriate and on a mutually agreed, transparent and case-by-case basis, the use of new and improved debt instruments such as debt swaps, including debt for equity in Sustainable Development Goal projects, as well as debt indexation instruments; External debt sustainability and development A/RES/80/123 11/13 25-20754 Reiterates the need for multilateral debt mechanisms to fully address sovereign external debt distress and provide an effective, efficient, equitable and predictable mechanism for managing debt crises in view of the development needs of developing countries;

Expresses its concern regarding the ability of non\u2011cooperative minority bondholders to disrupt the will of the large majority of bondholders who accept a restructuring of a debt-crisis country\u2019s obligations, given the potential broader implications in other countries, notes contractual and legislative steps taken by countries to prevent these activities, and encourages all Governments to take action, as appropriate, and, furthermore, takes note of discussions in the United Nations on debt issues; Encourages Governments to be mindful of the ability of non\u2011cooperative minority bondholders to block a restructuring of a debt-crisis country\u2019s obligations, and encourages debtors and creditors to work together to draft bond agreements accordingly;

Also recalls that, prior to the institution by the host country of any proceedings that require any person referred to in article IV, section 11, of the Agreement between the United Nations and the United States of America regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations, including representatives of a Member State, to leave the host country, article IV, section 13 (b) (1) of the Headquarters Agreement, Report of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country A/RES/80/172 3/5 25-20873 inter alia, requires the host country to consult with the Member State, the Secretary- General or other principal executive officer, as appropriate, and considers that, given the seriousness of any such measure being exercised by the host country, the consultation should be meaningful; Notes the problems experienced by some permanent missions to the United Nations in connection with the implementation of the Parking Programme for Diplomatic Vehicles,5 and notes that the Committee shall remain seized of the matter, with a view to continuing to maintain the proper implementation of the Parking Programme in a manner that is fair, non\u2011discriminatory, effective and therefore consistent with international law;

Recalls article IV of the Headquarters Agreement, notes the concerns expressed by some delegations concerning the denial and delay of entry visas to representatives of Member States, and further notes a relative decrease in the percentage of visas not issued and at the same time that the Committee remains seized of a range of visa issues that should be expeditiously resolved in a spirit of cooperation and in accordance with international law, including the Headquarters Agreement; Expresses serious concern regarding multiple cases of denial, non\u2011issuance and late issuance of entry visas, including in particular to delegates participating in high-level events, including the non\u2011issuance of a visa to a President and a number of high-ranking officials and other representatives for the general debate of the eightieth session of the General Assembly, in the work of the Main Committees at the seventy-ninth session of the General Assembly, including subsidiary bodies of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, emphasizes the importance of the full participation of all delegations in the work of the United Nations, and takes note of the statements of the Legal Counsel at the 297th and 298th meetings of the Committee, reiterating his statement at the emergency, 295th, meeting of the Committee, set out in document A/AC.154/415, as well as the statement of the _______________ 5 A/AC.154/355, annex.

Anticipates that the host country will ensure the issuance of entry visas to all representatives referred to in section 11 and members of the Secretariat pursuant to article IV, sections 11 and 13, of the Headquarters Agreement, in a timely manner, to enable persons recruited to serve in the Secretariat or assigned as members of permanent missions to take up their assignments as promptly as possible and to enable representatives of Member States to travel, in a timely manner, to New York on United Nations business, including to attend official United Nations meetings, and notes that the Committee anticipates that the host country will continue to enhance efforts, including visa issuance, to facilitate the participation of representatives of Member States in other United Nations meetings, as appropriate; Notes that a number of delegations have requested shortening the time frame applied by the host country for issuance and renewal of visas to representatives of Member States and members of their families, since the present time frame poses difficulties for the full-fledged participation of Member States in United Nations meetings, and invites the host country to inform the Committee, as appropriate, of efforts to address such difficulties, and while acknowledging that action taken in 2023 led to a relative reduction in processing times for certain Missions, remains seriously concerned that other Missions and Secretariat staff members of certain nationalities continue to be adversely impacted by processing times, and also notes that the Committee calls upon the host country to review its differing processes of granting visas to the personnel of certain missions, including single-entry visas, and the waiting time for issuance, with a view to ensuring that delegations are able to participate fully in the work of the United Nations; Notes with concern the difficulties experienced by some permanent missions to the United Nations in obtaining suitable banking services, and welcomes the continued efforts of the host country to facilitate the opening of bank accounts for those permanent missions; Stresses the need for the permanent missions and the United Nations to benefit from appropriate banking services, and anticipates that the host country will continue to assist the permanent missions accredited to the United Nations and their staff in obtaining such services; Expresses its appreciation for the efforts made by the United States Mission to the United Nations, and expects that the issues raised at the meetings of the Committee will be resolved in a spirit of cooperation and in accordance with international law, including the Headquarters Agreement; Affirms the importance of the Committee being in a position to fulfil its mandate and meet on short notice to deal with urgent and important matters concerning the relations between the United Nations and the host country, and in that connection requests the Secretariat and the Committee on Conferences to accord Report of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country A/RES/80/172 5/5 25-20873 priority to requests from the Committee on Relations with the Host Country for conference-servicing facilities for meetings of that Committee that must be held while the General Assembly and its Main Committees are meeting, without prejudice to the requirements of those bodies and on an \u201cas available\u201d basis; Requests the Secretary-General to remain actively engaged in all aspects of the relations of the United Nations with the host country at various levels in order to resolve the issues raised in the report of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country, and to more actively engage in the work of the Committee with a view to ensuring the representation of the interests concerned, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2819 (XXVI), and in this regard recalls the statements of the Legal Counsel at the emergency, 295th, meeting of the Committee, as set out in document A/AC.154/415, and also at its online informal meeting on 17 September 2020, recalls the position of the Committee as set out in paragraph 180 (q) of its previous report6 and that of the General Assembly as set out in paragraph 15 of its resolution 79/130 of 4 December 2024, notes the resourceful engagement of the Legal Counsel and the Secretary-General in discussions that have been formalized since the inclusion of subparagraph (p) in chapter IV of the report of the Committee in 2019 7 with the competent authorities of the host country regarding unresolved issues and the Legal Counsel\u2019s reports on the outcome of these discussions, most recently at its 309th, 310th and 320th meetings, and further notes with concern that serious issues still persist without effective resolution, recalls in this regard, once more, that serious consideration should be given to taking steps under section 21 of the Headquarters Agreement if certain issues raised in the report of the Committee remained unresolved following a reasonable and finite period of time, and accordingly once again reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to now give the most serious consideration and take any appropriate steps under section 21 of the Headquarters Agreement and intensify efforts to expedite resolution of the issues;

Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its eighty-first session the item entitled \u201cReport of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country\u201d. 64th plenary meeting 15 December 2025 _______________ 6 Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-ninth Session, Supplement No. 26 (A/79/26). 7 Ibid., Seventy-fourth Session, Supplement No. 26 (A/74/26).", "signals": ["report", "agenda"], "num_paragraphs": 17}, {"symbol": "A/RES/80/173", "filename": "A_RES_80_173.html", "content": "We reaffirm our commitment to the vision of the World Summit on the Information Society to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented information society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and peoples to achieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life, premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.2 We further reaffirm our commitment to and implementation of the Geneva Declaration of Principles,3 the Geneva Plan of Action,4 the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society.5 We reaffirm the value and principles of multi-stakeholder cooperation and engagement that have characterized the World Summit process since its inception, and recognize that effective participation, partnership and cooperation of Governments, the private sector, civil society, international organizations, the technical and academic communities and all other relevant stakeholders, including youth, with balanced representation of all countries, has been and continues to be vital in developing the information society. We reaffirm the principle of the sovereign equality of all States. We believe that the equitable and meaningful participation of Governments and other stakeholders from all countries is crucial to achieving the goals established at the Summit and to ensuring that no one is left behind in the pursuit of a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented information society. We recognize that Governments and other stakeholders from many developing countries face barriers to participating fully in international digital governance and policy-making processes due to financial, technical and institutional constraints, as well as infrastructure and connectivity gaps.

We welcome the tremendous growth in connectivity and development of the Internet and online services that has taken place since the World Summit. This has enhanced the ability of all stakeholders to develop and deploy technology and applications that have driven economic growth, social development and innovation. We recognize that digital development and digital inclusion are critical instruments in enabling progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and reaffirm the importance of cooperation to ensure that the benefits of digital cooperation are fairly distributed and do not exacerbate existing inequalities or impede the full achievement of sustainable development. We recognize that the outcomes of the World Summit are anchored in international law, including the Charter of the United Nations and international human rights law. We are committed to fostering an inclusive, open, safe and secure digital space for all that respects, protects and promotes all human rights and fundamental freedoms. We recognize that universal connectivity and meaningful and affordable access to information and communications technologies and the Internet, are fundamental to achieving the World Summit vision. We are concerned by the critical digital divides between and within countries in the development of, access to and use of digital technologies, which constrain the achievement of World Summit goals. Closing these divides requires investment in infrastructure and connectivity, along with efforts to ensure the affordability of networks and devices, the availability of content and services with linguistic diversity and the development of digital skills and capabilities. In this regard, we appreciate the efforts of the Technology Bank for the Least Developed Countries in strengthening the science, technology and innovation capacities of the least developed countries. We reaffirm that gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, and their full, equal, safe and meaningful participation in the digital space, are essential to close the gender digital divide and advance sustainable development. Our cooperation will empower all women and girls, encourage their leadership, mainstream a gender perspective and counter and eliminate all forms of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence that occurs through or is amplified by the use of technology. We are committed to catalysing women\u2019s economic agency by promoting equitable access to digital infrastructure and skills development, including to financial technologies and skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. We are committed to addressing the access and specific information and technology challenges faced by children, youth, older persons, persons with disabilities, Indigenous Peoples, migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons and those in vulnerable situations, and to the needs of future generations. We recognize that the pace and power of emerging technologies are creating new possibilities but also new risks for humanity, some of which are not yet fully known. We recognize the need to identify and mitigate risks and to ensure human oversight of technology in ways that advance sustainable development and the full A/RES/80/173 Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society 25-20874 4/20 enjoyment of human rights. We further underscore the importance of applying a human-centric approach throughout the life cycle of digital technologies, including in their design, development, deployment and use. We also recognize that building confidence and security in the use of information and communications technologies is critical to the implementation of World Summit goals, and that advancing digital inclusion requires a predictable and transparent enabling environment that encompasses policy, legal and regulatory frameworks that support innovation, protect consumer rights, nurture digital talent and skills, promote fair competition and digital entrepreneurship, enhance consumer confidence and trust in the digital economy, and contribute to economic and social growth. Information and communications technologies for development We are convinced that information and communications technologies have demonstrated great potential to contribute to prosperity and sustainable development. Their rapidly increasing capabilities and growing pervasiveness have enabled tremendous growth in the range of applications for development, creating new opportunities to improve productivity, prosperity and quality of life. We are deeply concerned, however, that this development potential remains constrained by persistent inequalities between and within countries, regions and communities. A third of the world\u2019s population still does not have access to the Internet, while many who have access face problems of affordability, limited content, including content in locally relevant languages, low digital literacy and skills. We reaffirm the central importance of closing these digital divides as a core priority of the 20-year review of the World Summit. Strengthened international cooperation and enabling policy environments are required to address gaps in and challenges to participation in the information society. We acknowledge that developing digital public goods and digital public infrastructure are critical drivers of inclusive digital transformation and innovation and recognize the need to increase investment in their successful development with the participation of all stakeholders. Digital public goods include open-source software, open data, open artificial intelligence models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable international laws, standards and best practices. We recognize that there are multiple models and definitions of digital public infrastructure, and we recognize that each society will develop and use shared digital systems according to its particular priorities and needs. We recognize that appropriate governance frameworks are essential to enhance trust in technology and data use while ensuring inclusion, fairness and human rights. We reaffirm the centrality of the World Summit action lines, as defined in the Geneva Plan of Action, as the main framework for translating the World Summit vision into concrete outcomes. We emphasize the importance of strengthening the implementation, follow-up and review of the World Summit action lines and ensuring their continued relevance to the World Summit vision and their contribution to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.6 Closing all digital divides We recognize the critical importance of closing digital divides to fulfil the World Summit vision and ensure that everyone can create, access, utilize and share _______________ 6 Resolution 70/1. Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society A/RES/80/173 5/20 25-20874 information and knowledge in order to take advantage of opportunities to benefit from digital technologies and improve their quality of life. We applaud the significant expansion in access to the Internet and digital services achieved since the World Summit on the Information Society. According to the International Telecommunication Union, more than 93 per cent of the world\u2019s population now lives in areas covered by 4G networks. The proportion of people aged 10 and above who own a mobile phone has reached 82 per cent globally, while Internet use has risen from just over 15 per cent in 2005 to 74 per cent in 2025. We express deep concern, however, about substantial and persistent digital divides between and within regions, countries and communities, which pose particular challenges for developing countries. The proportion of people reported by the International Telecommunication Union as using the Internet in high-income countries (94 per cent) is more than four times that in low-income countries (23 per cent), with the proportion below 20 per cent in some countries. The proportion of the population reported by the International Telecommunication Union as accessing the Internet in urban areas worldwide is estimated to be almost 85 per cent, while that in rural areas is 58 per cent. We are particularly concerned by persistent gender digital divides. Only 78 per cent of women and girls aged 10 and over worldwide are reported by the International Telecommunication Union to use a mobile phone compared with 87 per cent of men, while only 71 per cent of women are reported to be using the Internet compared with almost 77 per cent of men. Women and girls are also underrepresented in education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, employment, entrepreneurship and other areas of digital activity. All stakeholders have a part to play in addressing and rectifying these gender digital divides. We note that the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 7 affirms the need to ensure, on an equal basis with others, that persons with disabilities have access to information and communications technologies and systems. We are concerned that persons with disabilities nevertheless remain less likely to access the Internet. We call for concerted action by all stakeholders to promote accessibility and equal access to the Internet and digital resources as a priority, including through the availability of accessible and assistive technologies and the integration of accessibility-by-design principles in digital development. We are further concerned that other groups that experience disadvantage are underrepresented online, including older persons, ethnic and linguistic minorities, Indigenous Peoples, people of African descent, local communities, refugees and migrants. We urge all stakeholders to include the perspectives and needs of people in vulnerable situations and those in underserved, rural and remote areas in the development and implementation of national and local strategies for digital connectivity. We recognize that digital divides limit capabilities and opportunities for full participation in society. They reach beyond accessibility and include critical issues of affordability, language, ability, technological and innovation capacity, forming a multidimensional and widening challenge to sustainable development, and may exacerbate other social and economic inequalities. Overcoming them is fundamental to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the vision of the World Summit on the Information Society, and the objective and commitments of the Global Digital Compact.8 _______________ 7 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2515, No. 44910. 8 Resolution 79/1, annex I.

We call for strengthened international cooperation to address the financial and other constraints impeding the achievement of digital inclusion for all. In particular, we call upon governments, multilateral development banks, relevant international organizations and the private sector to develop financing mechanisms and incentives, including through North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation, to connect the unconnected to the Internet and to improve the quality and affordability of connectivity. We are committed to achieving entry-level broadband subscription costs that are accessible and affordable. This will require collaboration among all stakeholders and specifically between private and public sectors, including blended finance, as well as innovative mechanisms, including universal service funds and community networks. We recognize the continued role of public access facilities such as schools, post offices, libraries and hospitals, in making access available, including to those in vulnerable situations. We reiterate the need for the development of local content and services in a variety of languages and formats that are accessible to all people, and recognize the vital importance of multilingualism to reflect the linguistic, cultural and historical diversity of all nations. We commend the work that has been done since the World Summit to extend the multilingual nature of the Internet, including the introduction of internationalized domain names and progress towards universal acceptance, and urge all stakeholders to ensure that the Internet and digital services become fully accessible and affordable to all, including Indigenous Peoples and speakers of minority languages. The digital economy We recognize that the digital economy is an important and growing part of the global economy and has become increasingly central to global trade and economic development. Information and communications technologies have created new markets, businesses and employment opportunities in many economic sectors, while international trade and supply chains have diversified. E-commerce has come to play a major part in economic activity at the international, national and local levels, while digital technologies have been extensively adopted in all economic sectors, enabling enhancements in productivity, new forms of manufacturing, services and business models. We emphasize that fostering an open, fair and non\u2011discriminatory environment for digital development is a requirement for stronger global digital economic cooperation and integrating developing countries fully into global value chains and innovation networks. We will support the development of digital solutions to expand commerce, connectivity and services to overcome the adverse impacts of remoteness and other geographical and structural constraints in developing countries. We recognize that without the appropriate and adequate provision of means of implementation, the rapid pace and scale of digitalization may outpace the ability and readiness of some countries to adapt to digital transformation and its subsequent social and economic challenges. We also recognize that equitable and meaningful inclusion in the digital economy requires efforts to tackle concentrations of technological capacity and market power in order to ensure that the benefits of digital cooperation are fairly distributed and do not exacerbate existing inequalities or impede the full achievement of sustainable development. We note that financial services have evolved rapidly to take advantage of the capabilities of digital transactions, and that Internet banking, cashless payments Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society A/RES/80/173 7/20 25-20874 and mobile money systems have changed the ways in which many businesses and customers now interact, increasing access to financial services for many who were previously excluded. We will support developing countries, in line with their national circumstances and priorities, in creating enabling domestic environments for the development of digital financial services for all. We are encouraged that the growing use of digital services has created opportunities for enterprises in all countries, including micro-, small and medium- sized enterprises, to provide digital services to serve both domestic and export markets. We welcome the work of United Nations entities and development partners to support small businesses in developing countries, including businesses led by women, to take advantage of these opportunities, and urge all stakeholders to foster an inclusive digital environment that enables micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises to thrive, with appropriate financial support and access to capital, skills development, networks and markets. We note that digital technologies have had significant impacts on work, including changes in workplace environments and skills requirements, opportunities for more flexible work arrangements and the emergence of digital labour platforms. We note that emerging technologies such as automation, robotics and artificial intelligence are expected to further reshape the labour market, potentially displacing some roles, while also creating new employment opportunities and skill demands. We are determined to ensure that these developments serve to complement and augment human labour. Social and economic development We recognize that information and communications technologies have contributed to enhancing social welfare and inclusion, providing new channels for individuals, businesses and Governments to share and augment knowledge and to participate in decisions that affect people\u2019s lives, livelihoods and social welfare. They have had profound impacts on the provision of public services and have transformed the ways in which individuals and communities interact, consume and spend their time. While many of these impacts have been positive, others have raised concerns, including with respect to human rights, education, health, employment and the welfare of individuals and communities. We are encouraged that many Governments have established national strategies to leverage the opportunities of information and communications technologies for social and economic development, drawing on the framework of action lines established at the World Summit, and that they now provide a wide range of e-government services to citizens and businesses, enabling access to information and advice and, in many cases, the opportunity to undertake online transactions. We commend the role played by the United Nations system in e-government development. We recognize that digitalization has enabled new ways of providing education and training in schools, higher and adult education, including innovative educational approaches such as distance learning, open educational resources and online courses. We are concerned, however, that the benefits of digitalization are not yet available to many children and young people as a result of inequalities in connectivity, digital literacy, equipment, skills and educational facilities. We reaffirm our commitment to connecting every school to the Internet by 2030. We recognize that digitalization has also enabled new ways of addressing health and medicine by facilitating the dissemination of public health information, including on sexual and reproductive health and on protection against communicable A/RES/80/173 Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society 25-20874 8/20 diseases, remote diagnosis to support local health workers, improved analysis of health data and improvements in clinical practice. We reaffirm our commitment to building on the opportunities of information and communications technologies to improve access to health, especially in developing countries. We note that information and communications technologies have had substantial impacts on diversity of cultural expression and the development of the cultural and creative sectors. We urge all stakeholders to recognize the importance of ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage, including digital content, and promoting access to cultural resources. We recognize that information and communications technologies have helped Governments and other stakeholders to address risks associated with disasters and have facilitated humanitarian assistance at times of crisis through more consistent and remote monitoring of environmental and other hazards, enhancing and developing early warning systems and improving preparedness, response, recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction. We remain concerned, however, that equitable delivery of social and economic development programmes and opportunities is hampered by digital divides, particularly in countries and communities where access is constrained by poor connectivity, affordability and limited digital skills. Greater international cooperation is needed to promote digital inclusion and digital literacy, including capacity-building and financial mechanisms to achieve greater impact and ensure progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Environmental impacts We welcome the ways in which digital technologies support environmental sustainability by enhancing the monitoring and measurement of environmental change and hazards, implementing early warning systems and enabling Governments and development partners to prioritize interventions, protect those at risk and identify priorities. Digital technologies can also enable improvements in the efficient use of energy and other resources through smart management of systems and processes. Our cooperation will leverage these technologies for sustainability while minimizing their negative environmental impacts. We are concerned, however, about growing levels of demand for energy and water consumption arising from digitalization and the need to address both energy security, access and affordability and the impacts on climate change arising from growth in the manufacture and use of digital devices, the volume of data traffic, the number and impact of data centres, growing use of the Internet of things and rapid growth in artificial intelligence. We also recognize the need for the sustainable use of critical mineral resources, including scarce minerals required in the manufacture of digital equipment, and note the importance of responsible mining and processing practices. We are further concerned about the volume of electronic waste, which is growing rapidly, particularly in developing countries, leading to pollution and risks to human health, while rates of collection, recycling and recovery are low. We call upon all stakeholders to improve data gathering and facilitate collaboration in safe and efficient waste management, including through the sharing of technology and best practices. We recognize the need to promote sustainable consumption and production patterns, including sustainable lifestyles and circular economy approaches. We urge all stakeholders, and particularly Governments and the private sector, to develop Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society A/RES/80/173 9/20 25-20874 international standards for the design of sustainable digital products as well as for reuse, repair and recycling. We recognize that an inclusive and integrated approach is needed to enable policymakers to align digital and environmental policies, thereby enhancing their ability to address complex and interdependent global, regional and national challenges. We urge all stakeholders to cooperate in leveraging digital technologies for sustainability while minimizing their negative environmental impacts, promoting sustainability across the life cycle of digital technologies, including context-specific measures to increase resource efficiency and to conserve and sustainably use natural resources, and aim to ensure that digital infrastructure and equipment are sustainably designed to address environmental challenges. The enabling environment for digital development We acknowledge the importance of a positive enabling environment for investment, innovation and technological development in enabling implementation of the World Summit vision. We recognize that science, technology and innovation are integral to digital development and the importance of ensuring that stakeholders in all countries are able to play a part in digital innovation in order to foster digital development. We recognize that implementation of the World Summit goals benefits from a predictable and transparent enabling environment that encompasses policy, legal and regulatory frameworks that support innovation, protect consumer and intellectual property rights, nurture digital talent and skills, and promote fair competition and digital entrepreneurship. We note the importance of policy, legal and regulatory frameworks concerned with the deployment of digital networks and services, including those concerned with market structure, digital transactions, data protection and data privacy, consumer rights and intellectual property, human rights and environmental impacts. We support international, regional and national efforts to develop enabling environments for digital transformation, including predictable and transparent policy, legal and regulatory frameworks, and sharing of best practices. We call upon all stakeholders, where requested, to provide technical assistance to developing countries, in line with national digital transformation policies and priorities. We encourage the international community to promote the transfer of technology on mutually agreed terms, including information and communications technologies, to adopt policies and programmes with a view to assisting developing countries to take advantage of technology in their pursuit of development through, inter alia, technical cooperation and the building of scientific and technological capacity in our efforts to bridge the digital and development divides. We reiterate that States are strongly urged to refrain from promulgating and applying unilateral economic measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impede the full achievement of economic and social development, particularly in developing countries. We commend the work of the regional commissions and other regional organizations to support the development of positive enabling environments. We call upon them, the Commission on Science and Technology for Development and action line facilitators, within their respective mandates, to share experience on the enabling environment and support the development of demand-driven policy guidance, technical assistance and capacity-building, as appropriate, to realize them. A/RES/80/173 Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society 25-20874 10/20 Building confidence and security in the use of information and communications technologies We reaffirm that building confidence and security in information and communications technologies and their use is a crucial driver of innovation and sustainable development. We also reaffirm that building confidence and security in the use of information and communications technologies should be consistent with international human rights law. We commend the significant efforts that have been made by Governments, the private sector, international organizations, civil society and the technical and academic communities to build confidence and security and to protect infrastructure, services, transactions and other digital activities from the rising threat of malicious activities and physical risks to infrastructure. We take note of the final report of the open-ended working group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies 2021\u2013 2025 established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 75/240 and the establishment of the Global Mechanism on developments in the field of ICTs in the context of international security and advancing responsible State behaviour in the use of ICTs. We recognize the urgent need to counter and address all forms of violence, which occurs through or is amplified by the use of technology, all forms of hate speech and discrimination, cyberbullying and child sexual exploitation and abuse. We will establish and maintain robust risk mitigation and redress measures that also protect privacy and freedom of expression. We recognize the challenges that States, in particular developing countries, face in building confidence and security in information and communications technologies and their use. We reiterate the call made by the General Assembly in its resolution 70/125 for renewed focus on capacity-building, education, knowledge- sharing and regulatory practice, as well as promoting multi-stakeholder cooperation at all levels and raising awareness among users of information and communications technologies, particularly among the poorest and most vulnerable. Capacity development We note that lack of capacity is a major barrier to closing digital divides, and recommend that capacity development, including for innovation, be leveraged to empower local experts and local communities to benefit from and contribute to information and communications technology applications for development. We recognize the need to scale up international cooperation and financing for digital capacity development in developing countries and to support the development of local content and content relevant to local realities online. We stress, in particular, the importance of capacity development in technological innovation and in building the policy and technical expertise required to support innovation and address the increasingly complex challenges of governance arising from digitalization. We commend the work that has been undertaken by the technical community and other stakeholders to build expertise in technical aspects of digitalization and by United Nations entities and other stakeholders to develop the capacity of civil servants and the judiciary. We call for the strengthening of initiatives to support digital capabilities in these and other critical areas of digital transformation. We recognize the importance of digital skills and lifelong access to digital learning opportunities, taking into account the specific social, cultural and linguistic Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society A/RES/80/173 11/20 25-20874 needs of each society and persons of all ages and backgrounds. We call upon all stakeholders to promote digital skills and literacy in order to empower individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to make informed choices about their personal data, identify reliable information that will help them to gain access to opportunities, including work and skilling opportunities, and improve their quality of life, and take appropriate steps to safeguard their online security and privacy. Financial mechanisms We recognize that the scope and scale of financial investment in information and communications technology infrastructure have grown enormously since the World Summit as a result of expanding markets, new technological capabilities and new types of service. Harnessing information and communications technologies for development and bridging digital divides will require further sustained investment in infrastructure and services, capacity-building, the promotion of joint research and development and the transfer of technology on mutually agreed terms, with public as well as private investment. We call upon all stakeholders to promote an enabling policy environment for investment and to foster public-private cooperation and partnership for sustainable investment in information and communications technology infrastructure, applications and services, content and digital skills, with the aim of ensuring the meaningful connectivity needed to advance the Sustainable Development Goals. We recognize the critical importance of private sector investment in information and communications technology infrastructure, content and services. We also recognize that development partners, including multilateral development banks, and public funding have also played an important role in financing information and communications networks and services, particularly supporting their deployment in areas that have been considered commercially unviable. Innovative mechanisms, including universal access funds and community networks, have also contributed to extending connectivity in more remote areas. We reaffirm the call in the outcome document of the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development, the Sevilla Commitment, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 79/323 of 25 August 2025, for the development of financing plans and coordination of investment in digital infrastructure, including digital public infrastructure and digital public goods, and for international collaboration between national Governments, development finance institutions, multilateral development banks and relevant international organizations and private sector actors, to support countries in their design of digital infrastructure, its financing models and impact measurement. We recognize the scale of the problem in bridging and closing digital divides. We call upon international financial organizations and development partners to mainstream information and communications technologies in their work programmes and concessional finance, and to support developing countries and countries with economies in transition to prepare and implement their national e- strategies through existing and new mechanisms for financing infrastructure development, connectivity and the development of information and communications technology services. We invite the International Telecommunication Union, as the secretariat of the United Nations Group on the Information Society, working with the World Summit action line facilitators and other members of the Group, within existing resources, to establish an internal task force to conduct an assessment of gaps and challenges and to submit concrete recommendations on strengthening financial A/RES/80/173 Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society 25-20874 12/20 mechanisms for digital development for developing countries, building on and complementing existing best practices, including those of multilateral financial institutions, development partners and other relevant stakeholders, such as the private sector. We further request that the work be completed and the outcomes of the work be reported to the Commission on Science and Technology for Development at its thirtieth session, in 2027, for consideration by Member States. We also invite the internal task force to monitor financial commitments for the implementation of these outcomes. Human rights and ethical dimensions of the information society We recognize that respecting human rights has been central to the vision of the World Summit on the Information Society and that information and communications technologies have shown their potential to strengthen the exercise of human rights. We reaffirm our commitment to the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development, as enshrined in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Conference on Human Rights, 9 and to the framework of rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant human rights treaties. We reaffirm that democracy, sustainable development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as good governance at all levels, are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. We reaffirm our commitment that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online. We recall the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 78/213 on 19 December 2023, in which it set out principles and actions concerning the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of digital technologies. We will uphold international law, including international human rights law, throughout the life cycle of digital and emerging technologies, so that users can safely benefit from digital technologies and are protected from violations, abuses and all forms of discrimination. We commit to establishing appropriate safeguards to prevent and address any adverse impact on human rights arising from the use of digital and emerging technologies and protect individuals against violations and abuses of their human rights in the digital space, including through human rights due diligence and establishing effective oversight and remedy mechanisms. We recognize the responsibilities of all stakeholders in this endeavour. We call upon the private sector and all relevant stakeholders to ensure that respect for human rights is incorporated into the conception, design, development, deployment, operation, use, evaluation and regulation of all new and emerging digital technologies and to provide for redress and effective remedy for the human rights abuses that they may cause, contribute to, or to which they may be directly linked. We also call upon the private sector to apply the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d Framework. 10 We note the ongoing efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide expert advice and practical guidance on human rights and technology issues. We reaffirm our commitment to article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in which it is stated that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without _______________ 9 A/CONF.157/24 (Part I), chap.

We reaffirm our commitment to article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,11 in which it is stated that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence. We express concern regarding the use of surveillance in ways that undermine the right to privacy and other rights. We call upon Member States to ensure that surveillance technologies are only used when in accordance with international human rights law, including the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality, and that legal mechanisms of redress and effective remedies are available, and we call upon all business enterprises, including surveillance technology companies, to respect human rights in line with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We reaffirm our commitment to the provisions in article 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his or her personality is possible and that, in the exercise of his or her rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. We stress the importance for all Member States and stakeholders, to promote universal, free, open, interoperable, safe, reliable and secure use of and access to the Internet by respecting and protecting human rights and by refraining from Internet shutdowns and measures that target Internet access. We also call upon all business enterprises, including surveillance technology companies and companies responsible for social media platforms, to respect human rights in line with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We underscore the need to respect and protect the independence and diversity of media, including digital media, which are essential to maintaining information integrity and access to reliable and accurate information. We emphasize the importance of safeguarding journalists, media workers and other civil society actors. We call upon all stakeholders to strengthen independent and public media, support media workers and ensure the conditions that allow journalism to operate freely, sustainably and in the public interest without harassment, surveillance or arbitrary detention linked to their legitimate activities. We recognize that digital and emerging technologies can facilitate the manipulation of and interference with information in ways that are harmful to societies and individuals, and negatively affect the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. We will work together to promote information integrity, tolerance and respect in the digital space, as well as to protect the integrity of democratic processes. We will strengthen international cooperation to address the challenge of misinformation and disinformation and hate speech online and mitigate the risks of information manipulation in a manner consistent with international law. We stress the importance of ensuring that women and girls can participate in and contribute to society at large on equal terms and without discrimination and reaffirm that the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls in the digital age is critical to achieving gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. We _______________ 11 See resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex. A/RES/80/173 Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society 25-20874 14/20 recognize that we must urgently counter and address all forms of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, which occurs through or is amplified by the use of technology. We recognize that children are among the most active users of the Internet and online services. We remain committed to strengthening legal and policy frameworks to protect the rights of the child in the digital space, in line with international human rights law, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child.12 We welcome the comprehensive approach to promoting children\u2019s digital rights in the best interests of the child in the digital environment. Data governance We recognize that responsible and interoperable data governance is essential to advance development objectives, protect human rights, foster innovation and promote economic growth. We note the approaches to data governance that were adopted by the General Assembly in the Global Digital Compact. We note the establishment of a working group of the Commission on Science and Technology for Development to engage in a comprehensive and inclusive multi-stakeholder dialogue on data governance at all levels as relevant for development, including on follow-up recommendations towards equitable and interoperable data governance arrangements. Artificial intelligence We note the approaches to international governance of artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity that were adopted by the General Assembly in the Global Digital Compact. We encourage the development of international partnerships on artificial intelligence capacity-building to develop education and training programmes, increase access to resources including open artificial intelligence models and systems, open training data and compute, facilitate artificial intelligence model training and development, and promote the participation of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises in the digital economy. We will leverage existing United Nations and multi-stakeholder mechanisms to support artificial intelligence capacity-building to bridge artificial intelligence divides, facilitate access to artificial intelligence applications and build capacity in high-performance computing and related skills in developing countries. We call upon the Inter-Agency Working Group on Artificial Intelligence, in consultation with the action line facilitators, to map existing United Nations system-wide capacity-building initiatives, identify potential gaps and address them, inter alia, through establishing an artificial intelligence capacity-building fellowship for government officials and research programmes, leveraging existing United Nations system-wide capacities, with a particular focus on developing countries, and to report thereon at the inaugural Global Dialogue on Artificial Intelligence Governance, in 2026. We note the establishment within the United Nations of the work that is under way to establish a multidisciplinary Independent International Scientific Panel on Artificial Intelligence to promote scientific understanding through evidence-based impact, risk and opportunity assessments, drawing on existing national, regional and _______________ 12 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1577, No. 27531. Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society A/RES/80/173 15/20 25-20874 international initiatives and research networks. We also welcome the initiation of a Global Dialogue on Artificial Intelligence Governance, involving Governments and all relevant stakeholders, which will take place on the margins of existing relevant United Nations conferences and meetings. Internet governance We reaffirm the working definition of Internet governance set out in the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society as the development and application by Governments, the private sector and civil society, in their respective roles, of shared principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the Internet. We recognize the need to promote greater participation and engagement in Internet governance discussions of all stakeholders from all countries. Measures are needed to ensure more effective participation by stakeholders from developing countries and underrepresented groups, particularly African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States. We recognize that the Internet is a critical global facility for inclusive and equitable digital transformation. The open, interoperable nature of the Internet has underpinned the development of an extraordinary range of services and applications, reaching across the range of human society, including governance, economy, development and human rights. To fully benefit all, it must be open, global, interoperable, stable and secure. We reaffirm the need to promote international cooperation among all stakeholders to prevent, identify and address risks of fragmentation of the Internet. We recognize that Internet governance must continue to be global and multi\u2011stakeholder in nature, with the full involvement of Governments, the private sector, civil society, international organizations, technical and academic communities and all other relevant stakeholders in accordance with their respective roles and responsibilities. We reaffirm that Internet governance should continue to follow the provisions set forth in the outcomes of the summits held in Geneva and Tunis, including in relation to enhanced cooperation. We recall the work of the Working Group on Enhanced Cooperation on Public Policy Issues Pertaining to the Internet, established by the Chair of the Commission on Science and Technology for Development as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 70/125, to develop recommendations on how to further implement enhanced cooperation as envisioned in the Tunis Agenda. We reaffirm our commitment to maintain and improve cooperation between the activities of international and intergovernmental organizations and other stakeholders concerned with Internet governance. We take note of the NETmundial+10 guidelines for multi-stakeholder collaboration and consensus-building, endorsed in April 2024, as a contribution to strengthening Internet governance through inclusive participation, balanced representation and openness. We recognize that many new initiatives and opportunities have arisen since the World Summit that facilitate discussion and the sharing of experience and cooperation among Governments and with all other stakeholder groups. We call upon Member States and other stakeholders, in their respective roles and responsibilities, to cooperate to achieve the World Summit vision. A/RES/80/173 Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society 25-20874 16/20 We applaud the successful development of the Internet Governance Forum, established by the Secretary-General following the World Summit on the Information Society, which provides the primary multi-stakeholder platform for discussion of Internet governance issues, including emerging issues, as reflected in paragraph 72 of the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society. We welcome the evolution of the Internet Governance Forum from an annual meeting into a broader ecosystem encompassing intersessional and other activities, including dynamic coalitions, best practice forums and policy networks. We particularly welcome the emergence of more than 170 national, regional and youth Internet governance forums, which have enhanced multi-stakeholder discussion of relevant issues in all continents, many subregions and a majority of Member States. We also welcome the work of the Multi-stakeholder Advisory Group of the Forum and the establishment by the Secretary-General of the Leadership Panel of the Forum. We recognize the successful steps that have been taken since the 10-year review of the World Summit to improve the working modalities of the Internet Governance Forum, increase and broaden the participation of Governments and other stakeholders, particularly from developing countries and underrepresented groups, build stronger relationships with other digital discussion forums and enable more substantive outcomes that can achieve greater impact. We call for these measures to continue and request the Forum to report annually on progress towards their implementation to the Commission on Science and Technology for Development. We decide that the Internet Governance Forum shall be made a permanent forum of the United Nations, with a continued secretariat hosted by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the Secretariat, on a stable and sustainable basis with appropriate staffing and resources, in accordance with United Nations budgetary procedures. We call upon the Forum to report on outcomes of its annual meetings and intersessional work to relevant United Nations entities and processes, and call, in particular, on the United Nations Group on the Information Society and all relevant United Nations entities, action line facilitators, the Commission on Science and Technology for Development and the World Summit on the Information Society Forum to take Internet Governance Forum outcomes into account in their work and proceedings. We call upon the Forum to enhance its working modalities and to broaden the participation of Governments and other stakeholders from developing countries and underrepresented communities, by working on establishing and facilitating a dialogue among Governments with the participation of all stakeholders. We further call upon the Forum to reinforce its intersessional work, support national and regional initiatives, and apply innovative, open, inclusive, transparent and agile collaboration methods. The Internet Governance Forum should continue to serve as an inclusive platform for dialogue among all stakeholders, while strengthening the engagement of Governments and other stakeholders from developing countries in discussions on Internet governance and emerging technologies. We call for the strengthening of the secretariat of the Internet Governance Forum, to enable it to continue its development, implement further improvements and support the work of national and regional Internet governance forums and intersessional activities, and invite the Secretary-General, with support from the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, to submit a proposal to the General Assembly during its eightieth session to ensure sustainable funding for the Forum. Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society A/RES/80/173 17/20 25-20874 Development of the World Summit on the Information Society framework We believe that the arrangements established in the Tunis Agenda provide a sound foundation for continued implementation of the vision and principles established by the Summit. However, experience during and since the Summit, together with the evolution of the information society, suggests the need to ensure that they continue to support the achievement of the World Summit vision and objectives and coherence with the Global Digital Compact. We recognize that multi-stakeholder participation has been crucial to the success of the World Summit implementation framework, drawing expertise and experience from Governments, international organizations, the private sector, civil society, the technical community and academia, within their respective roles and responsibilities. We reaffirm the values and principles of multi-stakeholder cooperation and engagement that were established at the Summit, as reaffirmed in General Assembly resolution 70/125. We recognize the importance of ensuring coherence in the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Pact for the Future and the Global Digital Compact, by building synergies between them to ensure their effective implementation and avoiding wasteful duplication of resources and decision-making processes. We recognize in particular the importance of enabling all Governments and other stakeholders from all countries to play a full part in achieving their fulfilment. We welcome the efforts of United Nations entities, including World Summit action line facilitators, to support the implementation of World Summit outcomes over the past two decades within their mandates and areas of responsibility. We commend the International Telecommunication Union on its establishment of the World Summit stocktaking platform and the World Summit prizes, and encourage all stakeholders to contribute to the stocktaking database. We recognize the important role that has been played by the regional commissions in developing regional action plans to fulfil the World Summit vision. We reaffirm their mandates to serve as regional mechanisms for implementation and follow-up of World Summit outcomes, encourage them to continue their work within their regions and call for them to scale up technical assistance, capacity-building and partnerships. We note the establishment of the Office for Digital and Emerging Technologies to facilitate United Nations system-wide coordination on digital cooperation, working closely with existing mechanisms, and to support the follow-up to and implementation of the Global Digital Compact. We acknowledge the work of the International Telecommunication Union in collaboration with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the United Nations Development Programme to establish the annual World Summit on the Information Society Forum, which has become an important platform for the sharing of information and best practice and for multi-stakeholder dialogue and collaboration and for developing networks and coordinating initiatives to implement the World Summit vision. We call for the Forum to continue to be held on an annual basis. We reaffirm our commitment to the framework of action lines established in the Geneva Plan of Action and the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society. We recognize the value that many Governments have attributed to this framework in supporting the formulation of national strategies and approaches to digital development. A/RES/80/173 Outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society 25-20874 18/20 We call upon action line facilitators to ensure close alignment with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development when considering new work to implement the outcomes of the World Summit, according to their existing mandates and resources. Protecting, promoting and respecting human rights are important in the implementation of all action lines.

The road map should aim to strengthen coherence between the World Summit and the Global Digital Compact, ensuring a unified, resource-efficient approach to digital cooperation that avoids duplication and maximizes synergies across the United Nations system.

In particular, it is clear from the impact of chronic reoffending \u2013 repeated and intractable criminal behaviour, with serious consequences for victims as well as for public safety and confidence \u2013 that States should focus substantial efforts, including budgetary resources, on addressing this issue. The Model Strategies pursue the prevention of reoffending by investing in the rehabilitation and social reintegration prospects of offenders throughout the criminal justice process. In this regard, efforts aimed at both establishing rehabilitative prison environments and effectively using non-custodial measures in the community should be promoted. A growing body of evidence shows that reoffending can be prevented by promoting rehabilitation, social reintegration, individual desistance from crime and restorative justice. However, the problem cannot be solved by the criminal justice system alone. It is necessary to address the root causes of criminal behaviour, including poverty, social inequalities, marginalization, and racial and other forms of discrimination, as well as the practical difficulties and stigma that impede the successful reintegration of offenders into society. The Model Strategies recognize that breaking the cycle of reoffending requires a comprehensive, multisectoral and inter-institutional approach and the active participation of all sectors of society, without which it is likely that rates of reoffending will remain at the high levels reported around the world. Definitions of reoffending (also referred to as recidivism) vary widely across and even within different contexts, ranging from being rearrested or charged again to being reconvicted or reincarcerated, sometimes within certain time periods or in relation to different types of offences. Although clear and harmonized definitions at both the national and international levels are important for the measurement of reoffending, the development of evidence-based practices for its reduction and the generation of comparable data, the Model Strategies are not aimed at proposing a United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) A/RES/80/226 3/21 25-20943 definition of reoffending. For the purposes of the Model Strategies, reoffending is understood broadly as the commission of a new criminal offence by a person who has previously committed one or more offences. The link between young age and crime is well established, with aggregate crime rates peaking in late adolescence and early adulthood. Therefore, strategies, policies and programmes aimed at preventing child involvement in crime and reducing reoffending among children3 and young adults4 are of particular importance as an investment in the future and for minimizing victimization and promoting community safety. However, considering that children differ from adults in their physical and psychological development, and that the treatment of children in conflict with the law is governed by a distinct normative framework,5 the Model Strategies are not intended to cover issues relating to children. Although many of the approaches set out herein may also be effective in and appropriate for tackling child involvement in crime, the four core principles recognized in the Convention on the Rights of the Child6 should serve as the primary consideration when addressing that issue. To that end, States should establish specialized child justice systems and child protection services. States should also consider circumstances under which aspects of those systems and services may be extended to young adults, where applicable, in particular those in conflict with the law during the legal transition to adulthood. Attempts to reduce reoffending require gender-sensitive approaches that take into consideration different pathways to crime and any prior victimization, as well as specific social reintegration challenges, including socioeconomic disadvantages, gender-based violence and discrimination, and social stigma, unresolved trauma and mental healthcare needs. Strategies must also take into account, as applicable, the specific situations of women offenders who are pregnant, mothers of dependent children or primary caregivers. The Model Strategies are aimed at offering practical and flexible guidance to Member States and are not prescriptive in nature. Rather than establishing legal obligations, they are intended to provide good practices to be considered and used by Member States within the framework of their national legal systems in accordance with applicable international law, including relevant human rights law, and taking into consideration relevant provisions in existing United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, with respect for those existing standards and norms. The Model Strategies are aimed at contributing to crime prevention. They are to complement and to be implemented without prejudice to the broader efforts of Member States with regard to the assurance of public safety, the protection of society __________________ 3 As used in the Model Strategies, a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless under the law applicable to the child, the age of majority is attained earlier (e.g. the Convention on the Rights of the Child, art. 1). 4 There is no internationally agreed definition for the term \u201cyoung adult\u201d, nor is the concept of young adults recognized within all legal systems. As used in the Model Strategies, a young adult refers to a person who is 18 years old or older but is in the early period of adulthood, who, subject to the respective legal system, may still be dealt with for an offence as part of the juvenile justice system or in another manner that recognizes that person\u2019s physical and psychological development. 5 Including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (the Beijing Rules), the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines), the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty, the Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, and the United Nations Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Children in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. 6 Non-discrimination, the best interests of the child, the right to survival and development, and the right to participation. A/RES/80/226 United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) 25-20943 4/21 from crime, sentencing that is proportionate to the gravity, nature and circumstances of the offence, ensuring criminal accountability, addressing the root causes of reoffending, the protection of the rights of victims, and the prevention of interference with the delivery of justice. In view of the great variety of legal, social, economic and geographical conditions around the world, the efforts of Member States to develop strategies to address reoffending need to take into account the fact that the level of resources and institutional support required for their effective implementation varies significantly across countries and the fact that the local context must always be considered. The effective application of the Model Strategies requires close collaboration among governmental agencies as well as, in accordance with domestic law, constructive participation of relevant non-governmental stakeholders, including those advocating for or representing groups that would be most affected by the proposed strategies. Against this background, in the Model Strategies, individualization in the criminal justice process is considered central to reducing reoffending. Individualized assessments are, wherever appropriate, considered essential for making informed decisions in relation to an offender. In order to achieve the common goal of reducing reoffending, the Model Strategies are aimed at promoting, as appropriate, the effective use of non-custodial measures, including diversion programmes and alternatives to pretrial detention, at developing and enhancing rehabilitative prison management and at promoting the social reintegration of offenders as means to reduce reoffending. The Model Strategies also address the selection and provision of rehabilitation programmes and other interventions intended to reduce reoffending, which, whether implemented in prison or in the community, should be based on the criminogenic needs of individual offenders as well as on their personal strengths. Where incarceration is used, the Model Strategies are aimed at developing rehabilitative prison environments, ensuring effective release and reintegration processes and minimizing the risk of harm. The importance of cooperation, awareness-raising and capacity-building across and beyond the justice sector, and of sustainability measures, is emphasized. Lastly, the Model Strategies offer suggestions with regard to the identification and evaluation of efforts to reduce reoffending. The Model Strategies are intended to complement the existing body of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. Therefore, the strategies should be considered without prejudice to, and in conjunction with, other relevant standards and norms, in particular the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules), the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok Rules) and the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-custodial Measures (the Tokyo Rules). B. Individualized approaches Core principle I Decisions regarding the treatment of offenders should be tailored to address their individual circumstances and based on thorough and continuing assessments of their risks, needs and responsivity, such as capacities and dispositions. Consideration should also be given to an offender\u2019s life goals, values and aspirations. States should avoid a one-size-fits-all approach to addressing reoffending and avoid treating offenders or types of offenders as homogeneous groups. In determining United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) A/RES/80/226 5/21 25-20943 whether offenders are to be handled by the formal justice system, their sentence on conviction and how that sentence is to be implemented, decision makers should, where feasible, take account of the individuals concerned and their specific situation at that point in time.7 Assessments Model strategy No. 1 States should base their decisions regarding the treatment of offenders on individual assessments, which should be conducted by qualified professionals using standardized systems that are tailored to the local context and evaluated for their accuracy. In addition to involving prison and probation services, States should ensure the involvement of other relevant criminal justice actors in the conduct of individual assessments and their cooperation in the sharing of relevant information, with complementary support from social services and other relevant stakeholders, where applicable. Due attention should be paid to data protection safeguards in this regard. Decisions regarding individual offenders should exhibit a clear basis in the findings of individualized assessments. Such assessments should be conducted or updated, for example: (a) when the appropriate sentence or measure is being determined or when the diversion of an offender from formal criminal proceedings is being considered; (b) at the beginning of a period of imprisonment or supervision; (c) whenever there are significant changes which have an impact on the social or legal status in an offender\u2019s life; (d) when the early release of an offender from prison is being considered; (e) when a change in the nature or level of supervision or classification is being considered; and (f) at the end of a period of imprisonment or supervision. Assessments may also be reviewed at regular intervals in support of continued desistance efforts. Offenders should be informed, in a manner that they can understand, of the process and outcomes of their assessments. They should be encouraged to actively participate in the process, where appropriate. They should also, subject to domestic legislation, be given the ability and means to inform their families or any other person designated as a contact person accordingly. In order to complete a detailed assessment, it is critical to have reliable information regarding the offender\u2019s current offence (or offences), criminal history and socioeconomic and personal background. Gaining a full understanding of these factors requires close cooperation between criminal justice agencies and is also supported by cooperation with other actors, including social services, health sector agencies and civil society organizations. Case management systems and information- sharing protocols should be designed to facilitate access to the information required for the assessment, while also implementing individual data protection safeguards and security protocols. Depending on the stage at which the offender is being assessed, factors to take into consideration in individualized assessments should include the offender\u2019s gender, age, family situation, caretaking responsibilities, socioeconomic status and social exclusion, peer influence, education and vocational training or skills, employment history, housing and living conditions, and health status including disabilities as well as substance use disorders, prior trauma, victimization, any risk of suicide or self- harm, and other factors influencing mental health. A comprehensive diagnosis of the __________________ 7 See the Tokyo Rules, rules 7.1, 8.1 and 10.3; and the Nelson Mandela Rules, rules 89\u201394. A/RES/80/226 United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) 25-20943 6/21 offender\u2019s health disorders and subsequent treatment or other interventions may require an additional assessment by a qualified healthcare professional. It is also important to consider criminogenic needs and factors associated with criminal conduct, as well as protective factors. It is recommended that individual assessments be conducted in an appropriate multidisciplinary manner, including the involvement of the justice sector, social services and other relevant actors. C. Rehabilitation in the community and non-custodial measures Core principle II States should promote the use of non-custodial measures in appropriate cases, as such measures are beneficial in reducing reoffending. Imprisonment should be used as a measure of last resort. In decision-making in the area of criminal justice, consideration should be given to the least restrictive measures appropriate. In that context, a proper balance must be struck between the rights of offenders, the rights of victims and the interests of society for public safety and crime prevention. 8 When imprisonment is used, prison conditions should be rehabilitative and in line with applicable United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. The risks of reoffending could be increased rather than addressed if prison conditions are inappropriate for rehabilitation, if prison administrations do not follow a rehabilitative approach to prison management in accordance with applicable international human rights law, or if there is a lack of follow-up supervision and assistance after release. The appropriate use of non-custodial measures is beneficial in reducing reoffending because it enables offenders to maintain their relationships with and connection to their community. Due consideration should be given to whether rehabilitation and social reintegration interventions can be delivered more effectively in the community than in prison, while still holding offenders accountable and responsible for their actions; therefore, the criminal justice system should provide for a wide range of non-custodial measures, from pretrial to post-sentencing dispositions. The types of non-custodial measures will be determined by each State within its means. The number and types of non-custodial measures available should be determined in such a way that consistent sentencing remains possible. The selection of the appropriate non-custodial measure to be applied in a particular case should be determined on a case-by-case basis and be based on an assessment of established criteria. Diversion Model strategy No. 2 States should promote the use of diversion, taking into consideration the gravity, nature and circumstances of each offence as well as the effectiveness of diversion for the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. States may adopt legislation, policies or protocols in favour of the diversion of offenders based on individual assessments. At any stage of the criminal justice process, up to and including sentencing, with respect for due process and procedural safeguards for individuals and bearing in mind the primary purposes of the criminal justice system, offenders may be diverted, which __________________ 8 See the Tokyo Rules, rules 1.4 and 2.6. United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) A/RES/80/226 7/21 25-20943 would offer a way to respond to criminal offences and prevent reoffending without resorting to criminal sanctions. Offenders may be referred, with their agreement, to educational, mentoring, assistance, restorative justice, treatment or supervision programmes \u2013 including supervision outside the justice system \u2013 without necessarily going through formal proceedings, thereby minimizing their contact with the criminal justice system and mitigating their stigmatization and social exclusion. Diversion may be considered a preferred manner of dealing with young adults, where applicable, who are in conflict with the law. Subject to applicable domestic law, diversion may also be, wherever appropriate and feasible and at the earliest possible stage of the criminal justice process, a preferred response for offenders with relevant health conditions. The use of diversion should not necessarily be limited to first offences, in particular when treatable conditions are the key drivers of offending conduct. Criminal justice agencies need clear policies and guidelines on the use of diversion and the exercise of their discretionary authority to refer individuals to such programmes. Pretrial detention Model strategy No. 3 Pretrial detention should be used as a means of last resort in criminal proceedings, in line with its purpose, namely, to prevent the offender from absconding, committing further offences or interfering with the course of justice. States should develop and use alternatives to pretrial detention as important measures to reduce reoffending and should consider offering support to those who are released from such detention. The use of pretrial detention, in particular for prolonged periods, may generate or reinforce risks of reoffending and should be used as a means of last resort in criminal proceedings, with due regard for the investigation of the alleged offence and for the protection of society and victims.9 Decisions to hold suspected offenders in pretrial detention should be limited to situations in which it is considered necessary to address the risk that individual offenders may abscond, commit further criminal offences or interfere with the course of justice, including through the concealment or destruction of evidence. When pretrial detention is imposed, States should respect the special regime applicable to pretrial detainees, 10 including their separation from convicted prisoners. There is a need to develop and promote a wide range of alternatives to pretrial detention, such as sureties, bail supervision orders or other orders or undertakings by the court and monitoring, including electronic monitoring. Efforts should be made to raise awareness among decision makers of such alternatives and the potential adverse effects of pretrial detention, in particular for prolonged periods. Furthermore, both States and non-State actors should consider providing necessary support to individuals who are awaiting trial. Subject to their consent, those who are released should be provided with assistance in reintegration, in particular if they have experienced longer periods of pretrial detention or if they have no other support. __________________ 9 See the Tokyo Rules, rule 6.1. 10 See the Nelson Mandela Rules, rules 11 and 111\u2013120; and the Bangkok Rules, rule 56. A/RES/80/226 United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) 25-20943 8/21 Pretrial detainees should be provided with access to a legal adviser 11 or, in the case of need or when the interests of justice so require, a legal aid provider 12 in order to ensure that they receive, in a language that they understand, legal advice, assistance and representation and to ensure that those who do not pose a risk are released from detention. Sentencing Model strategy No. 4 States should include the use of non-custodial measures in their sentencing, whenever appropriate, including for repeat offenders. States should avoid the unnecessary use of mandatory or short-term prison sentences. In order to facilitate sentencing that best reduces reoffending, the courts should have access to legally available pre-sentence reports, social inquiry reports or relevant information provided in other forms. Preventing reoffending through rehabilitation and social reintegration should be recognized as one of the formal objectives of sentencing, together with crime prevention, the protection of society from crime, public safety and the protection of the rights of victims. Sentencing policies and practices should recognize the need to individualize sentences, with due consideration of the gravity, nature and circumstances of the offence and the personality and background of the offender. By nature, mandatory sentencing policies limit the judiciary\u2019s capacity to do so and to incorporate aspects related to the rehabilitation of offenders and the prevention of reoffending in its decisions. Furthermore, States may, where consistent with the principle of proportionality and deemed appropriate, consider a presumption against the use of short-term prison sentences, which usually offer little opportunity for rehabilitative interventions. With due regard to the principle of proportionality, sentencing policies and guidelines, where used, should include the use of non-custodial measures, including for repeat offenders in appropriate cases. States should provide for a wide variety of community-based sentencing options in their legislation, such as judicial supervision, probation, conditional or suspended sentences, including serving such sentences under an electronic monitoring system, unconditional discharge, community service orders, commitment to treatment programmes, restitution and victim compensation, status penalties and fines. There is also a need for gender-sensitive non-custodial measures, taking into account the history of victimization of many women offenders and their caretaking responsibilities.13 Pre-sentence reports, social inquiry reports or relevant information provided in other forms are critical for courts to reach objective and informed sentencing decisions for all offenders. Specific guidelines and specialized training for probation officers and others responsible for preparing such reports or similar information can help to ensure that sentencing courts have the information that they need to determine which sentence is most likely to encourage offenders to desist from crime and prevent them from reoffending. Where in use, the value of pre-sentence reports, social inquiry reports or relevant information provided in other forms should be considered to be of particular relevance when sentencing women, young adults and persons in vulnerable situations, __________________ 11 See the Nelson Mandela Rules, rule 61. 12 See the Nelson Mandela Rules, rule 61; and the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, paras. 8 and 9, and guideline 4. 13 See the Bangkok Rules, rule 57. United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) A/RES/80/226 9/21 25-20943 including those with relevant mental conditions. It is important to provide judicial authorities with relevant information about offenders\u2019 circumstances at the time of sentencing, including information about their family relationships, history of victimization, childcare responsibilities, experience of trauma and mental healthcare needs, as applicable.14 Similarly, where applicable, special consideration should be given to young adults and the circumstances of their offending, including information on their family relationships, history of victimization, experience of trauma, adverse childhood experiences, education and healthcare needs. When considering community-based measures, the court should base its decision on information about relevant programmes and resources available to the offender, as well as on an assessment of how the offender is expected to integrate into the community and comply with any conditions or restrictions that the court might impose. Findings and recommendations in pre-sentence reports, where in use, are a crucial source of information in this regard and should be as actionable as possible. Lessons learned from the practices of specialized problem-solving courts, such as drug courts, Indigenous courts, youth courts, mental health/wellness courts and community courts, where applicable, should be taken into account in the sentencing and treatment of special categories of offenders, as well as in supporting and monitoring them. Supervision in the community Model strategy No. 5 States should prioritize the provision of supervision in the community and support to offenders by suitably qualified and trained professionals with adequate resources. Conditions attached to non-custodial measures should be individualized, proportionate, unambiguous, limited to those necessary to address the risk, needs and circumstances of the offender, and subject to regular review and modification. States should invest in strengthening probation services and other agencies involved in the implementation of non-custodial measures to ensure that sufficient support can be provided to offenders in the community. Where in use, supervision in the community has proved to be a skilled task that goes beyond simply monitoring the behaviour of offenders; it involves managing the risk presented by offenders, acquiring or arranging resources to meet their needs and delivering treatment programmes. It requires developing and maintaining a working alliance with offenders to motivate them to desist from crime, reinforce positive behaviour and enforce consequences for negative behaviour. In this regard, it is important to have properly qualified and trained professionals with adequate resources to supervise and support offenders. Where feasible, the professionals should reflect the diversity of the people who come into contact with the criminal justice system; therefore, efforts should be made to ensure age and cultural diversity among those professionals and to be attentive to their safety, mental health and self-care needs. Probation orders, community service orders, conditional and suspended sentences, prison furloughs, parole, conditional release from prison and other non-custodial measures may be accompanied by various conditions with which offenders must comply, under supervision, in addition to refraining from reoffending. Such conditions, if any, should be proportionate, realistic and tailored to the offenders\u2019 individual risk, needs and circumstances, such as their work schedules and __________________ 14 See the Bangkok Rules, rule 61. A/RES/80/226 United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) 25-20943 10/21 family responsibilities. The conditions should also be clearly drafted and avoid ambiguities in order to enable compliance. Systems should be created for the conditions to be reviewed and modified to reflect changes in offenders\u2019 circumstances and progress made. In addition, tailored explanations and guidance should be provided to offenders with a view to making them fully aware of what is required of them, including the consequences of compliance and non-compliance and the duties and responsibilities of supervising personnel. Legal and policy procedures are required in order to ensure that the conditions of supervision are not excessive and that any breaches are dealt with fairly and effectively. In cases of non-compliance, decision makers should pay attention to and take into consideration the specific circumstances rather than automatically regarding the non-compliance as wilful or stemming from disrespect. All professionals involved in supervision should be educated and trained in the dynamics of addiction and the prevention of relapse behaviour, and in the multitude of barriers faced by survivors of abuse and trauma. They should also be aware of the importance of providing age- appropriate and culture- and gender-sensitive services. Decisions to revoke the provision of supervision in the community should take into consideration relevant provisions of the Tokyo Rules,15 after discussions with the supervising professionals and careful examination by the court or other competent authority. Whenever electronic means are used to supervise and monitor the movement of offenders in the community or of suspects released prior to trial, it is necessary to adopt clear legislative and policy standards and rules to ensure that the practice is proportionate, fair, effective, non-discriminatory and fully respectful of the rights of the persons concerned. Goals, policies and guidelines on the use of electronic monitoring devices should be established prior to their introduction, and periodically reviewed in order to take into account technological developments in the area and evaluate their effectiveness and any negative impacts. Training and awareness-raising should emphasize that electronic monitoring devices are an aid to supervision rather than supervision itself, and if they are not accompanied by sufficient human support, do not promote behavioural changes in offenders. Efforts should be made to avoid mass supervision and \u201cnet-widening\u201d, whereby the number of persons under the control of the criminal justice system increases. The overuse of unnecessary supervision, particularly for low-risk offenders, may increase the risk of reoffending. D. Rehabilitation and social reintegration support in correctional facilities Core principle III The prevention of reoffending by former prisoners depends not only on suitable rehabilitation programmes, but also on ensuring safe, secure and humane custodial environments and carefully managed reintegration processes. The protection of society against crime and the reduction of reoffending through imprisonment can be achieved only if the time served in prison is used to ensure that prisoners are able to reintegrate into society upon release so that they can lead a law-abiding and self-supporting life.16 Effective rehabilitation programmes should be delivered in an overall prison environment that ensures safe and decent conditions and the humane treatment of prisoners by qualified staff, in line with the applicable __________________ 15 See the Tokyo Rules, rules 14.2\u201314.4 and 14.6. 16 See the Nelson Mandela Rules, rule 4, para. 1. United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) A/RES/80/226 11/21 25-20943 minimum standards. Prison officers play a crucial role in the rehabilitation of prisoners by motivating them to participate in prison-based programmes and offering other support, and positive and prosocial relationships between prisoners and staff are also important to the success of rehabilitation. Prison conditions Model strategy No. 6 Prison authorities should intensify efforts to align prison management and conditions with the Nelson Mandela Rules and the Bangkok Rules in order to reduce the likelihood of reoffending upon release. In line with the Nelson Mandela Rules and the Bangkok Rules, which provide the basis for the prevention of reoffending by former prisoners, States should establish rehabilitative prison environments by ensuring that prisoners are treated fairly and with the respect due to their inherent dignity as human beings, and supported in their personal, judicial, moral and social rehabilitation; ensuring that prisoners\u2019 lives in prison reflect life in the community; ensuring proper prison administration and case management and addressing overcrowding, poor prison conditions, violence in prisons and corruption; providing interventions, treatment programmes, education, vocational training and work that are responsive to each individual\u2019s specific risks and needs; enabling offenders to maintain their community and family ties; and ensuring internal and external monitoring and inspection schemes, as well as external investigations, as necessary. The fulfilment of those and other relevant standards is crucial for prison-based rehabilitation programmes to be meaningful and effective, and they should be prioritized for attention and funding. States are encouraged to strive for the principle of \u201cnormality\u201d, according to which the custodial environment should be as similar to the community as possible, in order to minimize any differences between prison life and life at liberty that tend to lessen the responsibility of prisoners or the respect due to their dignity as human beings. 17 In prisons, individualized assessments of prisoners, which should be conducted as soon as possible upon admission, should enable the administration to gain an accurate understanding of prisoners\u2019 different security, custody and rehabilitation needs and to classify them accordingly.18 It may be necessary to develop specialized approaches for specific types of offences. The legal status of the offender, the type of offence committed and the length of the sentence should not be the only factors used to determine the classification and security categorization of prisoners and their allocation to suitable prison regimes, all of which should be reviewed on a regular basis. 19 Prison administrations should consider moving prisoners whose security categorization is reduced into lower-security facilities with fewer restrictions, increased responsibilities and greater opportunities for interaction with the community, to effectively prepare them for their reintegration upon release. In the construction of new prisons and the renovation of existing facilities, due attention should be paid to rehabilitative aspects, including accessibility to families, partners, services and qualified staff, and to designs that are smaller and less institutional in nature. 20 The recruitment and training of staff in accordance with international minimum standards 21 is critical, as are systems of oversight and accountability to ensure that duties are discharged and order is maintained by the administration alone, and that criminal hierarchies and activities are not tolerated within __________________ 17 See the Nelson Mandela Rules, rule 5. 18 See the Nelson Mandela Rules, rules 92 and 93. 19 See para. 12. 20 See the Nelson Mandela Rules, rule 89, para. 3. 21 See the Nelson Mandela Rules, rules 74\u201378. A/RES/80/226 United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) 25-20943 12/21 the prison environment. With regard to the maintenance of discipline and order, prison administrations are encouraged to use, to the extent possible, conflict prevention, mediation or any other alternative dispute resolution mechanism to prevent disciplinary offences or to resolve conflicts.22 Particular efforts should be made to minimize the use of solitary confinement,23 which has been found to increase the risk of reoffending as a result of both the lack of access to rehabilitation programmes and the serious negative impact of such treatment on the physical and mental health of prisoners. Family contact Model strategy No. 7 Constructive contacts between prisoners and their families and friends should be considered crucial for the successful reintegration of prisoners. The importance of maintaining and developing family relationships in particular should be explicitly stated and reflected in prison policies and regulations. Prisoners should be allocated, to the extent possible, to facilities close to their homes. The consensual transfer of foreign prisoners to their home countries may increase their chances of reintegrating by enabling increased family contact and culturally appropriate rehabilitation interventions. Open visits allowing for direct contact between the prisoner and visitors should be promoted for family visits, and there should be a presumption against a ban on visits by children. There should also be flexibility in visitation arrangements as well as access to telephone and video calls as complementary measures to accommodate family needs, in particular when family members live far away or are unable to visit. Policies should be developed in respect of persons who are not family members but who have a positive influence on the offender, and prisoners should be consulted on who may be permitted to visit them and should have the right to refuse visitation from certain persons, with safeguards in place to prevent reprisals. Support should be also provided to family members of prisoners to help them cope with practical, emotional and interpersonal issues relating to the release of offenders from prison, including through initiatives to support family members of prisoners with substance abuse disorders. Prison-based programmes Model strategy No. 8 States should invest in making programmes aimed at addressing the causes of offending available both to offenders subject to non-custodial measures and to those serving prison sentences;a in addition, programmes in correctional facilities should be aimed at increasing the social reintegration prospects of offenders upon release, while avoiding the potential for exploitation. a See sect. E. States should support prison authorities as much as possible in implementing the rehabilitation programmes referred to under model strategy 10.24 Furthermore, access to accredited education and vocational training, as well as remunerated work __________________ 22 See the Nelson Mandela Rules, rule 38, para. 1. 23 See the Nelson Mandela Rules, rule 45. 24 See para. 48. United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) A/RES/80/226 13/21 25-20943 programmes, can be useful in enhancing prisoners\u2019 positive self-identity, increasing their employability following their release and fostering positive links with the community. This is without prejudice to the fact that individual reoffending is often likely to have more complex causes than simple economic need. There is a need for proper research on marketable skills; assessments of partner companies in the community to ensure that they provide fair payment and training; strict safeguards to avoid exploitative or otherwise afflictive work schemes for prisoners and ensure fair remuneration for work performed; the provision of accredited qualifications to promote employability that are similar to those issued in the community; and the provision of training and work opportunities that do not differentiate between women and men due to gender stereotyping.25 It is important for relevant government stakeholders and civil society organizations to be engaged in the delivery of prison-based programmes and the preparation of offenders for their social reintegration upon release, including through the development of realistic post-release resettlement plans. Preparation for release and reintegration into society Model strategy No. 9 Prison authorities should cooperate closely with criminal justice practitioners, as well as relevant government and non-government stakeholders, to ensure a seamless transition for offenders from the custodial environment to the community, including through the provision of support in the areas of housing, employment and health and social welfare. Preparation for reintegration should begin at the time of an offender\u2019s admission to prison, and support should extend beyond the time of release or post-release supervision in the community, as necessary. Semi-open and open prisons, which allow prisoners to spend time in the community, can support the reintegration of offenders, in particular those who have served a long term of imprisonment, and their gradual transition from prison to the community. Parole or conditional release systems, which allow the supervised early release of offenders as well as the temporary release of offenders with appropriate behaviour, can also play an important role in supporting the successful reintegration of offenders without compromising public safety. Supervised residential settings, such as halfway houses, transition centres, resettlement units and pre-release centres, help offenders navigate a planned transition from custody to community living, allowing them substantial interaction with the outside world, as well as contact with their families, support networks and current or potential employers. States are encouraged to provide such facilities where feasible. Prisoners are at an increased risk of reoffending in the period immediately following their release. By connecting prisoners with services in the community, the pre-release period offers an opportunity to help prepare them for life outside prison. Inter-agency cooperation and communication between prison, probation, parole and community-based services is essential to ensure the continuity of care throughout the reintegration process. Engagement of private sector actors can also be considered in order to explore employment opportunities or internships for those released from detention. In the light of the detrimental effects that solitary confinement and similar restrictive measures may have on the mental and physical health and well-being of __________________ 25 See the commentary to rule 42 of the Bangkok Rules (UNODC, The Bangkok Rules: United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-Custodial Measures for Women Offenders with their Commentary (2011)). A/RES/80/226 United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) 25-20943 14/21 prisoners, care should be taken to ensure that prisoners who have been subject to such measures receive significant reintegration assistance when released into the community. Subject to an individualized assessment, expanded family contact and increased family involvement in preparation for release can further facilitate reintegration. Any possible history of violence, including sexual and domestic violence, should be duly considered in this regard, including by seeking relevant information from victims. Decisions regarding early release should be made with due consideration of each prisoner\u2019s family situation, including any parental responsibilities, as well as specific family reintegration needs and issues. At the time of a prisoner\u2019s release, the provision of support in the areas of housing, employment, health and social welfare should be prioritized. The provision of financial assistance should be considered where possible, and existing policies and practices concerning eligibility for various forms of social assistance and services should be reviewed to ensure that former prisoners are not barred from accessing the services that are essential for their reintegration. E. Addressing the causes of offending Core principle IV Rehabilitation programmes and other interventions intended to prevent reoffending should respond to the needs of individual offenders and the factors that cause them to commit crime. While designing and implementing rehabilitation programmes and other interventions, authorities should understand and take into consideration the individual criminogenic needs of offenders and the root causes of their offending, in order to prevent or decrease the likelihood of reoffending, and recognize that not all work- related programmes are effective in reducing reoffending. Interventions that do not address the specific reasons for an individual\u2019s offending may fail to decrease \u2013 or may even increase \u2013 the likelihood of reoffending. Rehabilitation programmes Model strategy No. 10 Rehabilitation programmes, whether in community or custodial settings, should be evidence-based, age-appropriate, culture- and gender- sensitive and subject to regular review and evaluation. Rehabilitation programmes should respond to the findings and recommendations of individual assessments. The success of such programmes is dependent on the capacity and attitudes of programme personnel, as well as on impartiality and consistency in the approaches taken. Offenders\u2019 motivation and responsiveness are also important factors, and programmes should be age-appropriate culture- and gender-sensitive. States are encouraged to develop a wide range of comprehensive rehabilitation programmes for application in both community and custodial environments. Such programmes could involve education at different levels, vocational training, employment assistance, physical and mental healthcare, including psychological support and counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy, relapse prevention, anger management, faith-based programmes, treatment for disorders such as substance use disorders, life skills training and family-oriented programmes, cultural activities, United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) A/RES/80/226 15/21 25-20943 physical exercise and sports, and other forms of constructive activities or assistance. It is essential to ensure the availability and accessibility of rehabilitation programmes, including by setting clear procedures and criteria for participation. The potential of making use of technological innovations in the form of online learning should be equally considered. Rehabilitation programmes should be based on evidence of effectiveness, have a clear theory of change and, in recognition of any limitations on resources, prioritize individuals who are most likely to reoffend. States should consider developing an accreditation process for new programmes, testing them during development, monitoring their implementation on an ongoing basis and evaluating their effectiveness, including by monitoring the capacity of programme personnel to deliver, supervise or support them. Restorative justice Model strategy No. 11 The use of restorative justice programmes should be considered as an option, an alternative to, or in combination with conventional criminal justice interventions. The value of restorative justice programmes should be recognized. Subject to consent and relevant safeguards, such programmes promote the rights, needs and interests of those affected by crime by facilitating the recovery of victims. They also enable offenders to take responsibility for the damaging impact of their offences on victims and the community at large, thereby increasing rehabilitation and social reintegration prospects. Restorative justice programmes and practices provide mechanisms for promoting the rights, needs and interests of those involved in and impacted by offending, based on the fundamental principle that criminal behaviour not only violates the law, but also affects victims and the community. Restorative justice programmes may be implemented at any stage of the criminal justice process, including the sentencing stage and during the execution of a sentence. Restorative justice is aimed at repairing the damage caused by a crime, through a process in which all affected parties are involved and during which offenders can take responsibility for their actions. While such approaches have been used in many cultures throughout history, restorative processes, including victim-offender mediation, restorative conferencing and circles, have become increasingly integrated into modern criminal justice systems, both as an alternative and as a complement to formal criminal justice processes. When applied in accordance with procedural safeguards, 26 giving due regard to the rights and needs of both offenders and victims and ensuring their informed consent, a restorative approach can reduce the likelihood that an offender will reoffend. It is also important to consider the use of restorative programmes in combination with other interventions designed to address individual risk factors associated with reoffending. Bearing in mind the different types of restorative justice programmes conducive to different societies, it is essential to raise awareness and enhance knowledge of __________________ 26 The basic principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in criminal matters (Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/12, annex) provide guidance to Member States in implementing restorative justice processes by setting the parameters for their use, as well as essential procedural safeguards. For the role of legal aid services, see the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems (General Assembly resolution 67/187, annex), paras. 1\u201313, principle 4 and guideline 7. A/RES/80/226 United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) 25-20943 16/21 restorative justice programmes, including the availability of programmes and how to access them, among criminal justice professionals and others who may be involved in referring offenders to such programmes. It is also important to provide specialized training to mediators and restorative justice facilitators and to establish inter-agency coordination mechanisms for appropriate referrals. The participation of the community in restorative justice processes is a valuable element in strengthening a sense of belonging and solidarity. Civil society organizations can be well placed to manage and deliver restorative justice programmes as an alternative to the criminal justice process. It is desirable that organizations delivering such programmes be supported and monitored, and that programme delivery be based on agreements and collaboration protocols with law enforcement and criminal justice agencies. The application of restorative justice programmes in contexts outside of the criminal justice sector, such as in schools, can also play an important role in gaining community support for a restorative approach to justice. Criminal records Model strategy No. 12 With a view to increasing the likelihood of the successful social reintegration of offenders, States should consider restricting unlimited access to criminal records and registers beyond competent authorities and limiting disclosure to narrowly defined circumstances. Any decision to grant limited access to such records should be proportionate to the level of public protection risks and be in accordance with domestic law. Unlimited access to criminal records and registers beyond competent authorities can have a negative impact on the successful social reintegration of offenders. Primarily for offenders who have since desisted from crime and successfully reintegrated into the community, States should consider the possibility of expunging or sealing their criminal records, in particular in relation to background checks by potential employers and other relevant external stakeholders. The extent to which access to criminal records is granted or restricted, including applicable timetables, should be regulated to the extent possible under applicable domestic law, taking into consideration both the social reintegration needs of the offender as well as public protection risks inspired by the crimes committed by offenders. Special consideration should be given to the criminal records of young adults, where applicable, in order to avoid further stigmatization and support reintegration. F. Partnerships, community engagement, capacity-building and sustainability Core principle V Reducing reoffending needs the active participation of not only the criminal justice sector but all relevant sectors of society, and significant amounts of time and resources should be invested in partnerships, outreach, training and sustainability measures. Partnerships should be established with a wide range of actors both within and outside the criminal justice sector, and efforts should be made to ensure that the aims of and rationale behind relevant policies are communicated clearly to the public. Investment in the training of criminal justice personnel and other professionals involved in supporting rehabilitation and reintegration initiatives should be United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) A/RES/80/226 17/21 25-20943 prioritized, and the reduction of reoffending should be specifically addressed in national legislation, policies and strategies. Partnerships and collaboration Model strategy No. 13 Clear protocols should be available for cooperation and collaboration among criminal justice agencies and with other relevant stakeholders. Efforts to reduce reoffending require close cooperation among different criminal justice agencies. For example, national inter-agency coordination is helpful for fair and proportionate sentencing by judicial authorities, which may rely on information provided by professionals from various sectors. Where probation services exist, the successful reintegration of people who have been released from prison necessitates close cooperation between such services and the prison administration. The police, the prosecution and the courts should familiarize themselves with non-custodial measures, including diversion, the implementation of which can involve the participation of multiple justice sector agencies. Protocols for collaboration should be available, including in relation to the sharing of relevant information in compliance with privacy and confidentiality principles. It is important for States to actively support the participation of, and cooperation among, all stakeholders that can play a role in the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders, including social services, victim support agencies, health services, employers and employment services, housing agencies, training institutions, and volunteers and civil society organizations. It is critical, however, to avoid duplication of efforts and potentially negative interventions by ensuring that a lead agency or individual is clearly designated as responsible for each case. Relevant and clearly defined mechanisms and protocols for multi-agency cooperation should be established, and it is important to ensure that a social reintegration mandate is incorporated into the mission and practices of all relevant agencies.27 Volunteers and civil society organizations Model strategy No. 14 The potential for volunteers and civil society organizations to contribute to the rehabilitation and social reintegration of offenders should be recognized, promoted and supported. Cooperation with volunteers and civil society organizations working both in prisons and in the community should be recognized and actively supported. Within the appropriate legal frameworks and under the supervision and sole responsibility of competent authorities, civil society organizations can, following screening and adequate training, be involved in preparing pre-sentence reports and in supporting individuals during the implementation of non-custodial measures and reintegration from custodial environments. Volunteers\u2019 activities may include involvement in peer support programmes, the fostering of connections between offenders and the community and the provision of practical assistance in the reintegration process. The role of community volunteers 28 __________________ 27 See the Tokyo Rules, rules 1.2, 17.1 and 18.4. 28 Such as community probation volunteers (Kenya), hogoshi (Japan), probation members (Republic of Korea), volunteer probation assistants (Philippines) and volunteer probation officers (Singapore). A/RES/80/226 United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) 25-20943 18/21 is crucial in this process. They are members of the public to which the offenders will eventually return, and can therefore serve as catalysts for reintegration. Volunteers can also play a significant role in providing a platform for community engagement and raising public awareness of the importance of offender reintegration. Youth volunteers and youth-oriented civil society organizations may be regarded as essential agents of the rehabilitation and social reintegration of children in conflict with the law for minor offences and other targeted offenders. Youth volunteers can play a significant role as catalysts for change for those offenders in empowering themselves and building life skills that allow them to better cope with daily challenges and to move away from involvement in crime. Youth volunteers may need additional support from competent authorities. Legal and administrative mechanisms should be developed to ensure the accountability of civil society organizations and community volunteers and the sustainability of their activities. Such mechanisms should encompass careful recruitment, screening, training, guidance and support (practical, financial and psychological), evaluation, monitoring and supervision by competent authorities. It is also important to cultivate public recognition of the work of those organizations and volunteers, including by disseminating information on and celebrating their contributions through relevant events, awareness-raising, giving awards to dedicated volunteers, supporting national associations of volunteers and developing international volunteer networks. Public awareness and understanding Model strategy No. 15 States should design and implement campaigns and outreach programmes to raise public awareness and understanding of initiatives to reduce reoffending, in particular campaigns to encourage acceptance of and support for the use of non-custodial measures and other measures for the reintegration of offenders. It is crucial that efforts are made to increase public understanding of the rationale behind and the benefits of non-custodial measures and other measures and approaches aimed at reducing reoffending and increasing community safety. Cost- benefit analyses may serve as an important tool for advocacy with the public and policymakers. Public acceptance and awareness are instrumental in lessening the stigma experienced by those released from prison or subject to non-custodial measures. While awareness-raising activities may take various forms and be conducted at both the national and local levels, such activities should convey a common message that community support is vital to offender reintegration, which will ultimately result in fewer victims and greater public safety. Community leaders and civil society organizations are among the actors that have a key role to play in this respect, and they should be actively engaged in order to help address the multiple and complex needs of offenders and build the necessary support in the communities to which they are returning.29 __________________ 29 Kyoto Declaration on Advancing Crime Prevention, Criminal Justice and the Rule of Law: Towards the Achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (General Assembly resolution 76/181, annex). United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) A/RES/80/226 19/21 25-20943 Capacity-building Model strategy No. 16 States should recognize and promote the critical role that criminal justice personnel can play in the reduction of reoffending. Professional training programmes should be developed and provided with adequate resources in line with international standards and good practices, and opportunities should be provided for exchange and capacity development within the criminal justice sector and with other relevant actors. It is essential to invest in the training, professional development and supervision of front-line professionals who work with offenders, in particular prison and probation officers, and to provide them with appropriate working conditions, taking into account measures to build a sense of security and support. Where possible, opportunities should be created for the joint training of prison and probation staff, as well as for training with staff from other agencies and civil society in order to encourage inter-agency and interdisciplinary approaches to preventing reoffending. Positive and prosocial relationships between offenders and prison and probation staff are important to the success of rehabilitation. Beyond their functions related to containment and supervision, there is a need to promote and invest in their role as skilled practitioners and agents for change who can develop constructive relationships with offenders, model prosocial behaviour and provide practical help and resources to support desistance from crime and prevent reoffending. This should be reflected in recruitment policies, selection procedures and the training of prison and probation staff. It is also important to provide education and training to other justice sector actors, including the police, prosecutors, lawyers and judicial authorities, so that they understand the objectives and impact of imprisonment and non-custodial measures. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop and support the capacity of civil society organizations and volunteers, including peer support providers, to assist with and deliver effective and evidence-based rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes in prisons and the community. Technical assistance in developing and implementing professional training programmes and other capacity-building initiatives should be made available to Member States upon request. In this regard, the exchange of experience and good practices should be promoted at the national and international levels among the criminal justice personnel and other relevant stakeholders including volunteers. The creation of a pool of national experts would be an added value in this regard. Sustainability Model strategy No. 17 States should develop national strategies and action plans aimed at the reduction of reoffending, as necessary. A strategic and sustainable approach to the development of effective offender rehabilitation and reintegration policies and programmes requires effective laws, regulations and policies. States should engage in legal reviews to identify and address any legal policy gaps and other regulatory obstacles preventing or hindering the sound operation of criminal justice agencies, taking into consideration the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, inter-agency cooperation and measures such as alternatives to imprisonment. Such reviews should A/RES/80/226 United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) 25-20943 20/21 cover sentencing policies, including in relation to mandatory or short-term prison sentences, and policies on the use of pretrial detention and restorative justice programmes. 30 Provision should be made for meaningful systems of parole or conditional release from prison, with clear mechanisms for effective supervision and assistance in the community, including budgetary support. To ensure a long-term, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to the reduction of reoffending so that offenders can receive necessary services in the community after the end of their involvement with the criminal justice system, it is recommended that each State develop a national strategy (with an associated action plan) that provides a clear vision of the goals to be achieved, delineates the respective roles and responsibilities of relevant stakeholders and establishes programme delivery mechanisms. A national strategy can mobilize financial resources, promote the development of inter-agency cooperation and protocols as outlined above, and support an ongoing political commitment to the reduction of reoffending. G. Research and evaluation Core principle VI States are strongly encouraged to invest in research, including comparative and multidisciplinary research, into patterns of reoffending and the effectiveness of responses. All decisions about what to measure and how to undertake data collection and analysis with regard to reoffending should be guided by the overall objective of supporting the development of evidence-based policies that enhance the rehabilitation and reintegration prospects of offenders. Measurement and monitoring Model strategy No. 18 Those undertaking research or presenting data should provide clear definitions and scientific analysis to support their findings and should consider a range of indicators beyond rates of reoffending. In order to ensure high-quality research findings on the complex issues of rehabilitation and reoffending, all research should be undertaken by qualified staff, take into account gender-sensitive approaches, cultural differences and potential biases, and benefit from collaboration with universities and other academic institutions, where appropriate. Developing national definitions of reoffending is an important starting point for research, but internationally standardized definitions and means of measurement are useful in order to have comparable data that can contribute to a global knowledge base. A specific definition of reoffending must be provided whenever the term is used in relation to a given study or initiative. Reported variations and changes in rates of reoffending should be analysed for their statistical significance and practical implications and guide the development of further policies and programmes. When arrest and pretrial detention rates are used as measures of reoffending, the fundamental right to the presumption of innocence must be clearly stated and fully respected. __________________ 30 See sects. C and E. United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) A/RES/80/226 21/21 25-20943 In addition to administrative statistics kept by criminal justice authorities, other ways to measure reoffending should be considered, as offences themselves are underdetected and underreported. This is particularly true of certain types of offences, such as domestic violence and other forms of gender-based violence, including gender-based violence facilitated by technology. It is also important to include in research positive indicators that measure the success of reintegration, such as individual progress in the areas of employment, housing, education, health and well-being. Self-reporting surveys designed to uncover undetected or unreported reoffending can shed light on important policy and operational issues. The collection of qualitative data from those with lived experience of the criminal justice system can further increase understanding of the reasons for reoffending and build knowledge of \u201cwhat works\u201d; it is, therefore, an integral element of policy development. Research on reoffending should take into account gender-sensitive approaches and cultural diversity among communities, countries and regions. There may be context-specific patterns of reoffending and institutional biases that influence reoffending rates, such as systemic discrimination. Careful consideration should be given to the transferability of reoffending prevention programmes from one context to another. Information-sharing and technical assistance with data collection, research and evaluation at the national and international levels must be supported and facilitated, including through the exchange of promising practices and collaborative research initiatives.", "signals": [], "num_paragraphs": 72}, {"symbol": "A/RES/80/227", "filename": "A_RES_80_227.html", "content": "Recognizes that illicit trafficking in wild fauna and flora, including timber and timber products, and the illegal mining of and illicit trafficking in minerals and precious metals, as well as illicit trafficking in waste, may constitute crimes that affect the environment of a serious nature and are increasingly being exploited by transnational criminal organizations as a source of significant profit of their operations; Also recognizes the economic, social and environmental impacts of crimes that affect the environment, where firm and strengthened action needs to be taken in countries of supply, transit and demand to tackle transnational organized crimes that affect the environment, and re-emphasizes the importance, in that regard, of effective international cooperation among Member States, based on the principle of shared responsibility and in accordance with international law; Further recognizes therefore the need for a balanced approach to tackling crimes that affect the environment, whereby enforcement is complemented by action _______________ 8 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2225, No. 39574. 9 Ibid., vol. 2349, No. 42146.
