                        Except for draft resolutions introduced at the final meeting of the substantive part of the session on 21 November 2025, it is the practice of the Committee to take action on each draft resolution at the plenary meeting following that at which the draft resolution was introduced, or at a later date. Any anticipated action on draft resolutions or decisions will be announced in advance, including in the Journal and on the website of the Committee. It is the practice of the Sixth Committee to strive for the adoption of draft resolutions without taking a vote. <mark class="bg-yellow-200 px-0.5 rounded">Conference</mark> resources available

                        Yet, 30 years after the convening of the World Summit for Social Development, progress remains slow and uneven, and major gaps and inequalities persist within and among countries. With only five years remaining until the 2030 deadline, progress towards achieving most of the Sustainable Development Goals has been far too slow, with some goals stalled or even regressing despite notable advances in a few areas: (a) Although great strides have been made in reducing poverty since 1995, in recent years progress has slowed, and millions of people still live in extreme poverty and over 1 billion people endure poverty in different forms and dimensions. Children, women, persons with disabilities, people living in rural areas and those in vulnerable situations experience higher poverty rates than the rest of the population. Hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition are still a reality, with global undernourishment rising in recent years. While access to education has expanded, still too many children are out of school; (b) In addition, while millions have been lifted out of poverty, billions of people live close to the poverty line and face a constant risk of falling into extreme poverty. Despite significant global progress in gradually expanding social protection __________________ 8 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1771, No. 30822. 9 Adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

I, Resolutions Adopted by the <mark class="bg-yellow-200 px-0.5 rounded">Conference</mark> (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.93.I.8 and corrigendum), resolution 1, annex I. A/RES/80/5 Doha Political Declaration of the “World Social Summit” under the title “the Second World Summit for Social Development” 25-17700 4/18 coverage, including social protection floors, almost 4 billion people still lack access to any form of social protection, including nearly 2 billion children; (c) Millions of workers continue to live in poverty, earning wages and incomes that are not sufficient for an adequate standard of living or to sustain their families. Informal employment remains pervasive, with billions of people making their living in the informal economy. Women and young people are disproportionately engaged in informal and precarious employment. Furthermore, progress towards ending child labour is too slow; (d) Millions of youth do not have access to education, employment or training, the majority of whom are young women. In the labour market, young people, especially youth with disabilities, experience higher levels of unemployment, informal employment and working poverty. These decent work deficits can have long- lasting consequences on poverty eradication efforts and affect the well-being of current and future generations; (e) Today, inequality has reached staggering levels. Since 1995, income inequality has increased in many countries, developed and developing. Global wage gaps remain significant. Gender inequality is deeply entrenched. On average, women earn less than men and millions of women worldwide are outside the labour force; (f) Persons with disabilities continue to be more likely to live in poverty, are underemployed and unemployed, and face additional disability-related costs, including medical costs, as well as other significant and persistent social and economic barriers to inclusion in society; (g) Digital divides within and among countries persist, particularly in rural and remote areas. Billions of people currently do not have connectivity, access to the Internet and lack digital skills. Digital infrastructure, connectivity and access to the Internet in developing countries, particularly least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, remain challenging; (h) Multiple, persistent and new challenges are reversing social development gains, including geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, economic crises, inequalities within and among countries, climate change, natural hazards and disasters, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, water scarcity, desertification, pollution, conflict-induced famine and starvation, humanitarian emergencies and forced displacement of people, refugee crisis, pandemics and other health emergencies, gender inequality, racial discrimination, uneven technological advancements, unsustainable debt burdens and unequal access to technology and capital; (i) Complex and interrelated opportunities, challenges and risks related to demographic shifts remain, including rapid population growth, declining birth rates and population ageing. Between 2024 and 2030, the number of persons aged 60 years or over is globally projected to outnumber youth, and this increase will be the greatest and the most rapid in the developing world.
