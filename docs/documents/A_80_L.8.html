We also emphasize the importance of countering such misuse while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with our obligations under international law. In this regard: (a) We take note of the adoption of the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime; Strengthening International Cooperation for Combating Certain Crimes Committed by Means of Information and Communications Technology Systems and for the Sharing of Evidence in Electronic Form of Serious Crimes;14 (b) We call for the strengthening of law enforcement digital expertise and capacity to conduct proportionate, lawful, accountable and necessary investigations in cyberspace, including the dark web, and seize associated electronic evidence. We encourage the appropriate use by law enforcement of technology-based solutions that address the global scope of trafficking in persons; (c) We express deep concern about the growing misuse of artificial intelligence or machine-learning technologies to generate, disseminate hate speech for the purpose of trafficking in persons, including on social media platforms, through, inter alia, the use of artificial content, including images, videos and other forms of media, while also recognizing the potential of such technologies to detect and mitigate harmful content when developed and deployed safely; (d) We further encourage the appropriate use of technology and innovative tools by practitioners and central authorities to increase international and, where relevant, cross-border cooperation in criminal matters, recognizing the need for the ethical use of technology consistent with human rights obligations; (e) We call for effective partnerships among the public sector, civil society, academia and the private sector, including technology companies, to enhance innovation, cooperation and the use of technology, including artificial intelligence, to combat trafficking in persons. We emphasize the particularly important role played by Internet service and access providers, and call upon them to fulfil their responsibilities and promptly detect, report and remove sexual exploitation and abuse materials related to trafficking in persons, while we commit to taking legislative and other measures to facilitate these actions.</p>

We encourage Member States, multilateral organizations and the private sector to adopt ethical and transparent practices in their procurement and supply chains, and strongly urge them to regularly disclose and provide relevant information. We are mindful of the need to ensure that all actors in global supply chains, including intermediaries, who profit from the labour of trafficking victims are to be held __________________ 14 Resolution 79/243, annex. A/80/L.8 25-17125 8/8 accountable, including through sufficiently stringent sanctions and appropriate policy and legislation. In this regard, we recall the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 15 We stress the need to establish firewalls between immigration checks and labour inspections, to implement labour standards and to improve government procurement practices to promote decent work. We emphasize the importance of awareness and education campaigns, in partnership with civil society and the media, to combat acceptance of forced labour. We also urge the Secretary-General to ensure that all United Nations procurement does not contain goods and services produced by victims of human trafficking.</p>
