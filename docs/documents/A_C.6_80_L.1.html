This is without prejudice to the possibility of delegations sponsoring a proposal for a draft resolution at the time of the Committee’s action on the latter during a plenary meeting. Sponsorship should take place at the level of the Sixth Committee, given that, once the Committee has adopted a proposal for a draft resolution and recommended its adoption by the General Assembly, its sponsorship can no longer be altered by Member States. Proposals for draft resolutions submitted on behalf of the Bureau are not subject to sponsorship.</p>

It is therefore imperative that the Sixth Committee allow sufficient time for the preparation of estimates of expenditure by __________________ 3 See www.un.org/en/ga/sixth/80/programme.shtml.

Bearing in mind that 21 November has been fixed as the concluding date for the work of the Sixth Committee (see para. 6), 7 November would have to be considered the mandatory deadline for submission to the Fifth Committee of draft resolutions with financial implications, except for draft resolutions concerning items to be considered after that date. When submitting such proposals, delegations may also wish to bear in mind that, in most cases, a period of more than 48 hours, up to four days, is required for the Secretary-General to review the programme budget implications of proposals. Accordingly, the deadline for finalization and submission of all draft resolutions for budget review and processing is 14 November 2025.</p>
