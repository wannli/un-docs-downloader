Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 72/313, delegations are encouraged to adhere to the “all protocol observed” principle and to refrain from listing standard protocol expressions during their statements. In the same resolution, the Assembly recommended that speakers should be mindful of the speed of statement delivery, bearing in mind the need for accuracy of interpretation. As per past practice, the Committee will maintain a “rolling” list of speakers for the general debate, which means that delegations should be ready to deliver their statements earlier, if necessary.</p>
