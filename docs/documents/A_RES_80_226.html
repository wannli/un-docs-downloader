In particular, it is clear from the impact of chronic reoffending – repeated and intractable criminal behaviour, with serious consequences for victims as well as for public safety and confidence – that States should focus substantial efforts, including budgetary resources, on addressing this issue. The Model Strategies pursue the prevention of reoffending by investing in the rehabilitation and social reintegration prospects of offenders throughout the criminal justice process. In this regard, efforts aimed at both establishing rehabilitative prison environments and effectively using non-custodial measures in the community should be promoted.</p>

However, the problem cannot be solved by the criminal justice system alone. It is necessary to address the root causes of criminal behaviour, including poverty, social inequalities, marginalization, and racial and other forms of discrimination, as well as the practical difficulties and stigma that impede the successful reintegration of offenders into society. The Model Strategies recognize that breaking the cycle of reoffending requires a comprehensive, multisectoral and inter-institutional approach and the active participation of all sectors of society, without which it is likely that rates of reoffending will remain at the high levels reported around the world.</p>

Therefore, strategies, policies and programmes aimed at preventing child involvement in crime and reducing reoffending among children3 and young adults4 are of particular importance as an investment in the future and for minimizing victimization and promoting community safety. However, considering that children differ from adults in their physical and psychological development, and that the treatment of children in conflict with the law is governed by a distinct normative framework,5 the Model Strategies are not intended to cover issues relating to children. Although many of the approaches set out herein may also be effective in and appropriate for tackling child involvement in crime, the four core principles recognized in the Convention on the Rights of the Child6 should serve as the primary consideration when addressing that issue. To that end, States should establish specialized child justice systems and child protection services. States should also consider circumstances under which aspects of those systems and services may be extended to young adults, where applicable, in particular those in conflict with the law during the legal transition to adulthood.</p>

As used in the Model Strategies, a young adult refers to a person who is 18 years old or older but is in the early period of adulthood, who, subject to the respective legal system, may still be dealt with for an offence as part of the juvenile justice system or in another manner that recognizes that person’s physical and psychological development. 5 Including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (the Beijing Rules), the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines), the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty, the Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, and the United Nations Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Children in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. 6 Non-discrimination, the best interests of the child, the right to survival and development, and the right to participation.

Due consideration should be given to whether rehabilitation and social reintegration interventions can be delivered more effectively in the community than in prison, while still holding offenders accountable and responsible for their actions; therefore, the criminal justice system should provide for a wide range of non-custodial measures, from pretrial to post-sentencing dispositions. The types of non-custodial measures will be determined by each State within its means. The number and types of non-custodial measures available should be determined in such a way that consistent sentencing remains possible.

By nature, mandatory sentencing policies limit the judiciary’s capacity to do so and to incorporate aspects related to the rehabilitation of offenders and the prevention of reoffending in its decisions. Furthermore, States may, where consistent with the principle of proportionality and deemed appropriate, consider a presumption against the use of short-term prison sentences, which usually offer little opportunity for rehabilitative interventions.</p>

It requires developing and maintaining a working alliance with offenders to motivate them to desist from crime, reinforce positive behaviour and enforce consequences for negative behaviour.

There should also be flexibility in visitation arrangements as well as access to telephone and video calls as complementary measures to accommodate family needs, in particular when family members live far away or are unable to visit. Policies should be developed in respect of persons who are not family members but who have a positive influence on the offender, and prisoners should be consulted on who may be permitted to visit them and should have the right to refuse visitation from certain persons, with safeguards in place to prevent reprisals. Support should be also provided to family members of prisoners to help them cope with practical, emotional and interpersonal issues relating to the release of offenders from prison, including through initiatives to support family members of prisoners with substance abuse disorders.

Restorative justice programmes may be implemented at any stage of the criminal justice process, including the sentencing stage and during the execution of a sentence. Restorative justice is aimed at repairing the damage caused by a crime, through a process in which all affected parties are involved and during which offenders can take responsibility for their actions. While such approaches have been used in many cultures throughout history, restorative processes, including victim-offender mediation, restorative conferencing and circles, have become increasingly integrated into modern criminal justice systems, both as an alternative and as a complement to formal criminal justice processes. When applied in accordance with procedural safeguards, 26 giving due regard to the rights and needs of both offenders and victims and ensuring their informed consent, a restorative approach can reduce the likelihood that an offender will reoffend. It is also important to consider the use of restorative programmes in combination with other interventions designed to address individual risk factors associated with reoffending.</p>

For the role of legal aid services, see the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems (General Assembly resolution 67/187, annex), paras. 1–13, principle 4 and guideline 7. A/RES/80/226 United Nations Model Strategies on Reducing Reoffending (the Kyoto Model Strategies) 25-20943 16/21 restorative justice programmes, including the availability of programmes and how to access them, among criminal justice professionals and others who may be involved in referring offenders to such programmes. It is also important to provide specialized training to mediators and restorative justice facilitators and to establish inter-agency coordination mechanisms for appropriate referrals. The participation of the community in restorative justice processes is a valuable element in strengthening a sense of belonging and solidarity. Civil society organizations can be well placed to manage and deliver restorative justice programmes as an alternative to the criminal justice process. It is desirable that organizations delivering such programmes be supported and monitored, and that programme delivery be based on agreements and collaboration protocols with law enforcement and criminal justice agencies. The application of restorative justice programmes in contexts outside of the criminal justice sector, such as in schools, can also play an important role in gaining community support for a restorative approach to justice. Criminal records Model strategy No. 12 With a view to increasing the likelihood of the successful social reintegration of offenders, States should consider restricting unlimited access to criminal records and registers beyond competent authorities and limiting disclosure to narrowly defined circumstances. Any decision to grant limited access to such records should be proportionate to the level of public protection risks and be in accordance with domestic law.</p>

Primarily for offenders who have since desisted from crime and successfully reintegrated into the community, States should consider the possibility of expunging or sealing their criminal records, in particular in relation to background checks by potential employers and other relevant external stakeholders. The extent to which access to criminal records is granted or restricted, including applicable timetables, should be regulated to the extent possible under applicable domestic law, taking into consideration both the social reintegration needs of the offender as well as public protection risks inspired by the crimes committed by offenders. Special consideration should be given to the criminal records of young adults, where applicable, in order to avoid further stigmatization and support reintegration. F. Partnerships, community engagement, capacity-building and sustainability Core principle V Reducing reoffending needs the active participation of not only the criminal justice sector but all relevant sectors of society, and significant amounts of time and resources should be invested in partnerships, outreach, training and sustainability measures.</p>

Where probation services exist, the successful reintegration of people who have been released from prison necessitates close cooperation between such services and the prison administration. The police, the prosecution and the courts should familiarize themselves with non-custodial measures, including diversion, the implementation of which can involve the participation of multiple justice sector agencies.

Cost- benefit analyses may serve as an important tool for advocacy with the public and policymakers. Public acceptance and awareness are instrumental in lessening the stigma experienced by those released from prison or subject to non-custodial measures. While awareness-raising activities may take various forms and be conducted at both the national and local levels, such activities should convey a common message that community support is vital to offender reintegration, which will ultimately result in fewer victims and greater public safety. Community leaders and civil society organizations are among the actors that have a key role to play in this respect, and they should be actively engaged in order to help address the multiple and complex needs of offenders and build the necessary support in the communities to which they are returning.29 __________________ 29 Kyoto Declaration on Advancing Crime Prevention, Criminal Justice and the Rule of Law: Towards the Achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (General Assembly resolution 76/181, annex).

Measurement and monitoring Model strategy No. 18 Those undertaking research or presenting data should provide clear definitions and scientific analysis to support their findings and should consider a range of indicators beyond rates of reoffending. In order to ensure high-quality research findings on the complex issues of rehabilitation and reoffending, all research should be undertaken by qualified staff, take into account gender-sensitive approaches, cultural differences and potential biases, and benefit from collaboration with universities and other academic institutions, where appropriate.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-sm">Developing national definitions of reoffending is an important starting point for research, but internationally standardized definitions and means of measurement are useful in order to have comparable data that can contribute to a global knowledge base. A specific definition of reoffending must be provided whenever the term is used in relation to a given study or initiative. Reported variations and changes in rates of reoffending should be analysed for their statistical significance and practical implications and guide the development of further policies and programmes. When arrest and pretrial detention rates are used as measures of reoffending, the fundamental right to the presumption of innocence must be clearly stated and fully respected. __________________ 30 See sects.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-sm">In addition to administrative statistics kept by criminal justice authorities, other ways to measure reoffending should be considered, as offences themselves are underdetected and underreported. This is particularly true of certain types of offences, such as domestic violence and other forms of gender-based violence, including gender-based violence facilitated by technology.</p>

Self-reporting surveys designed to uncover undetected or unreported reoffending can shed light on important policy and operational issues. The collection of qualitative data from those with lived experience of the criminal justice system can further increase understanding of the reasons for reoffending and build knowledge of “what works”; it is, therefore, an integral element of policy development.</p>
